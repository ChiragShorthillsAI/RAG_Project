Hustlersis a 2019 Americancrimecomedy-dramafilm written and directed byLorene Scafaria, based onNew Yorkmagazine's 2015 article "The Hustlers at Scores" byJessica Pressler.[5]The film starsConstance Wu,Jennifer Lopez,Julia Stiles,Lili Reinhart,Keke Palmer,Lizzo, andCardi B. It follows a crew ofNew York Citystripperswho begin to steal money by druggingstock tradersandCEOswho visit their club, then running up their credit cards. Lopez also served as a producer on the film throughNuyorican Productions, alongsideJessica Elbaum,Will Ferrell, andAdam McKaythrough theirGloria Sanchezbanner.
First announced in February 2016, the film was originally set to be financed and distributed byAnnapurna Pictures. However, amid financial trouble, Annapurna dropped the rights in October 2018. AfterSTX Entertainmentpicked them up, much of the cast joined that fall through the following spring, and filming took place in New York City from March to May 2019.
Hustlershad its world premiere on September 7, 2019, at theToronto International Film Festival, and was theatrically released in the United States on September 13, 2019. The film received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Lopez's performance, for which she received nominations at theGolden Globe,Critics ChoiceandScreen Actors Guildaward ceremonies. It grossed $157.6 million worldwide against a production budget of $20.7 million.
In 2014, former New York City-based stripper Dorothy is invited for an interview with Elizabeth, a journalist working on a story involving Dorothy's former friend and mentor, Ramona Vega.
Seven years prior, Dorothy, known by her stripper name as Destiny, is working at Moves, astrip club, to support her grandmother but is barely getting by. Mesmerized by Ramona's performance and the tips she earns, Destiny meets her on the roof of the club. Ramona agrees to take Destiny under her wing, and the two form a formidable team. Destiny enjoys newfound wealth and friendship with Ramona. A year later, thefinancial crisis of 2007–2008strikes, and both women find themselves short of cash. Destiny becomes pregnant. She kicks her boyfriend out of the house shortly after their daughter's birth, and she is unable to find a new job.
With no other options, Destiny moves back into her grandmother's place with her daughter. Moves has changed: the financial crisis has impacted their business, and the club is primarily staffed by immigrant women willing to perform sex acts for money, a line Destiny is unwilling to cross, but she does in a moment of desperation. She reconnects with Ramona, who introduces her to a new scheme. Along with her two protégées, Mercedes and Annabelle, Ramona targets rich men at bars, gets them drunk, and then escorts them to Moves where the girls steal their credit card numbers and charge them to their limit. Destiny joins in, and learns that Ramona uses a mix ofketamineandMDMAto impair judgment and cause memory loss in their targets, a tactic deemed worthwhile since their victims will rarely admit to being robbed by strippers.
The scheme works, and the women enjoy their new source of wealth. When some of the targets prove too aggressive for Mercedes and Annabelle to handle, Destiny suggests bringing in other girls, who are carefully trained to avoid drinking or using drugs. Ramona's partnership with Moves makes the credit card fraud lucrative for them. However, cracks start to show in their operation. Other strippers begin to emulate their strategies. Furious, Ramona cuts her business ties with Moves, and the group begins to service clients in hotel rooms or their own homes. Mercedes and Annabelle become increasingly unreliable with this new practice, so Ramona hires women with drug problems and criminal records to replace them, while Destiny balks at bringing in "junkies and criminals". Destiny's fears prove true when a client suffers a near-fatal accident and she must take him to the hospital. Meanwhile, Ramona is busy bailing out a particularly unreliable new hire, Dawn. Destiny returns home to find her grandmother has died. At the funeral, Ramona makes amends and promises to take care of Destiny from now on.
Back in 2014, Destiny becomes uncomfortable and stops the interview when Elizabeth insists on talking about Ramona. When Elizabeth returns home, Destiny calls and agrees to finish their conversation, recalling how her friendship with Ramona – and their crime ring – fell apart. Ramona's callousness drives a wedge between the women, and Destiny feels she can no longer justify her crimes. Dawn is picked up by the police and "flips" on her partners, while investigators manage to locate several victims and identify all of the girls. Destiny, Ramona, Annabelle, and Mercedes are arrested, but, only Destiny (thinking of her daughter) takes a plea deal. Ramona is sentenced to five years probation, while the others serve short jail sentences before being released on probation.
A year later, Elizabeth visits Ramona, who is now working aretailjob. Ramona reveals a childhood photo of Destiny that she keeps along with her most valued possessions. The article is published, and Elizabeth encourages Destiny to reach out to Ramona and make amends.
In February 2016, it was announced thatJessica Elbaum,Will FerrellandAdam McKaywould produceHustlers, under theirGloria Sanchez Productionsbanner.[6]The film was also produced by Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, andJennifer LopezthroughNuyorican Productions.[7]In May 2016,Annapurna Pictureswas announced to co-produce and finance the film, with the studio'sMegan Ellisonand Chelsea Barnard serving as executive producers. In October 2018, it was announced Annapurna had dropped the film, withSTX Entertainmentacquiring distribution rights to the film.[8]Annapurna allegedly dropped the film due to budget concerns.[9][10]
Hustlerswas directed byLorene Scafariafrom a screenplay she wrote.[11]Upon first receiving Scafaria's script, Gloria Sanchez Productions first hadMartin Scorsesein mind to direct, while also consideringAdam McKay. ProducerJessica Elbaumstated that their initial approach was to "send this to the people that we've seen make this type of movie."[12]After Scorsese and other directors passed on the project, producers ultimately gave Scafaria, who had refused to take on other directorial projects in hopes of directingHustlers, thegreen-lightto direct. Scafaria convinced the producers to hire her as director with a two-minutesizzle reelshe created to demonstrate her concept.[13][12]Scafaria described the "judgment that people have about strippers" as a challenge in getting the film made.[12]According to producer Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, who was pitchingHustlersto a range of studios after Annapurna dropped it, "[the male studio executives] were a little uncomfortable. Everybody could see the commercial value of this movie, but they were like, 'Can they just drug the bad guys? Can they just do it to the people that deserve it?'"[12]
After being chosen to direct, Scafaria spent two years casting forHustlers.[12]In August 2018, it was announced that Jennifer Lopez would star in the film.[11]Lopez was Scafaria's first choice to play Ramona, stating: "as soon as I was done, I realized, Oh my God, Ramona is Jennifer Lopez [...] It has to be her."[12]Lopez, who plays a veteran stripper in the film, beganpole dancetraining with professional dancer and choreographer Johanna Sapakie two and a half months before filming in preparation for a scene that has Lopez performing a major solo pole dance routine without a professional stand-in.[14][15]Constance Wujoined the cast in October,[8]after putting herself on tape, noting: "I knew that my résumé at that point didn't really have anything that would indicate that I could pull off this role."[12]In March 2019,Cardi B,Lili Reinhart,Keke Palmer,Julia Stiles, andMercedes Ruehljoined the cast with Mette Towley andTrace Lysettein negotiations to join as well.[16]That same month,Madeline BrewerandFrank Whaleyjoined the cast of the film.[17]Lizzo joined the cast of the film in April 2019,[18]and Usher joined the cast in May.[19]Scafaria had the idea to cast Cardi B, a former stripper, in the film, prompting Lopez to convince her to join the project. Lopez said: "I know she knew this world better than any of us. I told her she had to do it. And I wasn't going to take no for an answer."[12]
Principal photography forHustlersbegan on March 22, 2019 in New York City, with the shoot lasting 29 days. Production wrapped on May 3.[16]Scenes were also shot north of the city inNew Rochelle,White Plainsand at thePalisades Center.[20]According to producer Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, the production budget for the film was $20.7 million.[2]Cameos by Usher, Lizzo, and Cardi B, were all filmed the same day.[21]
Hustlerscostume designer, Mitchell Travers, defined the origins of the film's costumes and treatment in an interview withVanity Fair, stating that "I knew it [had] to absolutely floor the audience, and let them know that this is not going to be like any movie that they've seen before." Travers designed the costumes for Lopez to showcase the strength and muscle tone she amassed during her pre-Hustlerstraining. Without running afoul of the film's planned R rating, he dreamed up the diamond bodysuit that was essentially connected by three straps. Travers commented: "We did a lot of research and development to find something that could [stretch in every direction during Lopez's dance]. It's performance wear, and really had to work for that sequence. We did a number of fittings on it. It is tailored within an inch of its life, completely custom for her."[22][23]
The soundtrack toHustlersfeatures a list of songs ranging from late 1990sR&B,dance music,indie pop, to classical interludes,[24]includingJanet Jackson,Fiona Apple,Britney Spears,Lorde, andFrédéric Chopin. As Scafaria explained: "I thought of [the film] as a musical — the songs themselves were telling a story. Most of the music choices were also written into the script, I had obviously imagined scenes to these songs, and we shot to these songs, but you never know if you're going to get the rights."[25][26]The film's music supervisor, Jason Markey, got artists fromBig SeantoBob Segerto sign-off permission to include their songs in theHustlerssoundtrack; however, the film deliberately does not feature any songs from the catalogs ofJennifer Lopez,Lizzo, orCardi B. Markey noted that, "We didn't have a score, either; every song made a statement about the scene."[27]
The teaser trailer forHustlerspremiered online on July 17, 2019.[28]Thefull theatrical trailerpremiered online on September 3, 2019.[29]
Hustlersheld its world premiere at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 7, 2019.[30]It was theatrically released in the United States on September 13, 2019 which was on Reinhart's birthday.[31]The studio spent around $38 million on promotions and advertisement.[32]
The film was banned outright from release in Malaysia, and has received censorship in several Asian countries. The film was denied a clearance certificate by theMalaysian Film Censorship Board, for showing what officials called "excessive obscene content".[33]
Hustlersgrossed $105 million in the United States and Canada, and $52.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $157.6 million.[4]Deadline Hollywoodcalculated the net profit of the film to be $47million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[32]
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongsideThe Goldfinch, and was projected to gross $25–30 million from 3,250 theaters in its opening weekend.[34]The film made $13.1 million on its first day, including $2.5 million in Thursday night previews.[35][36]It was the biggest single day gross in STX Entertainment's history.[37]The film went on to debut to $33.2 million, finishing second, behind holdoverIt Chapter Two; the opening marked the most successful in STX's history and the best of Lopez's live-action career.[38]The audience breakdown of the opening weekend was 67% female, including 69% being over the age of 25.[39]It dropped 49% in its second weekend to $16.8 million, finishing in fifth, and made $11.5 million in its third weekend, jumping to third.[40][41]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 87% based on 354 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Led by a career-best performance from Jennifer Lopez,Hustlersis a uniquely empowering heist drama with depth and intelligence to match its striking visual appeal."[45]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[46]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B−" on an A+ to F scale, and those atPostTrakgave it an average 3.5 out of 5 stars and a 50% "definite recommend".[39]The film was also chosen byTimemagazine,[47]HuffPost,[48]andNPRas one of the best films of 2019.[49]
Christy Lemire rated the film 3 stars, describingHustlersas "Goodfellasin a G-string... Scafaria's film is always a blast to watch, resulting in a surprising level of emotional depth." Lemire also described it as "Lopez's best screen work since her early heyday ofSelenaandOut of Sight..." and a "...career-best performance."[42]Kate Erbland ofIndieWireratedHustlersan A− and describes the film as "funny, empowering, sexy, emotional, and a bit scary. The Oscar chatter for Lopez's revelatory, nuanced, and emotional turn as a brilliant con artist and better exotic dancer is no joke."[50]Variety's Peter DeBruge writes, "flashy, fleshy and all-around impossible to ignore,Hustlersamounts to nothing less than a cultural moment, inspired by an outrageous New York Magazine profile... adapted by writer-director Scafaria at her most Scorsese, and starring Jennifer Lopez like you've never seen her before."[51]
Justin Chang, writing for theLos Angeles Times, describes the film as "brassy and invigorating" stating that "Scafaria's clear-eyed grasp of that distinction that makesHustlersmore than just a girls-gone-wild cautionary tale, a peekaboo parade or a hypocritical amalgam of the two. The movie's empathy for its leads and its wholly justified rage against the architects of financial collapse is held in check by the knowledge that every hustle has its collateral damage."[43]The Guardian's Benjamin Lee, rated the film 4 out of 5 stars, stating that "even when films have focused on strippers as something other than window dressing, they've still been written and directed by men and have smoothed over rougher edges, turning them all into titillating one-note archetypes. Instead, Scafaria views the strip club like any other workplace, filled with internal politics and an ever-changing hierarchy of power."[52]Beandrea July ofThe Hollywood Reporterstated that "Hustlersdelivers on its hype while consistently doing the unexpected. Scafaria, whose last pic was theSusan SarandonvehicleThe Meddler(2015), excels at immersing the audience in the world of sex-work in clubs, quietly disabusing us scene by scene of any stereotypes about who these women are."[53]
Emily VanDerWerff ofVoxwrites "as you're distracted by all that razzle-dazzle and the movie's many, many great jokes,Hustlersis quietly composing some deeply profound thoughts about the relationships women build with each other."[54]Brennan Carley ofGQcalledHustlersthe best movie of 2019 to date, noting: "starting with a bang is one thing, though; maintaining that energy throughout its entire run-time is what makes this strippers-turned-criminals flick such a masterful feat."[55]Rolling Stone's film criticPeter Traverswas also positive, stating that, "Hustlersdoesn't pussyfoot about what goes on in those 'champagne rooms' off stage. The intent is not to exploit but to show how women manage to live and work in a predatory man's world", adding that "in Scafaria's fiercely funny provocation of a film—there's no running from the shadows—it's the women who seize control."[44]
IndieWire's annualTIFFCritics Survey of the 2019 best films and performances at the festival ranked Lopez's performance the best female performance as well as the fourth best performance among movies premiered at TIFF.[56]OnTime's annual best performances of the year list,Stephanie Zacharekranked Lopez as the second-best film performance of 2019.[57]Also,A. O. ScottfromThe New York Timesranked Lopez as one of the 10 Best Actors of 2019.[58]IndieWire included both Lopez and Wu on its annual ranking of the 20 best film performances by actresses.[59]

Lorene Scafaria(born May 1, 1978) is an American filmmaker, playwright, musician, and actress. She wrote and directed the filmsSeeking a Friend for the End of the World(2012),The Meddler(2015), andHustlers(2019), as well as writing the filmNick & Norah's Infinite Playlist(2008).
Scafaria directed theSuccession(2018–2023) episodes "Too Much Birthday", "Honeymoon States", and "Living+". She earned nominations for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Seriesfor "Too Much Birthday" and "Living+", in addition to a nomination for theDirectors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Drama Seriesfor "Too Much Birthday".
Scafaria was born inHolmdel, New Jersey, on May 1, 1978, the daughter of Gail (née Kiernan)[1]and Joseph Scafaria (1939–2009).[2]Her mother is a Canadian-American, while her father was an Italian immigrant fromGioia Tauro.[2][3]She has a brother named Vincent.[2]She became interested in writing when she began making a book report on a fake book every month in order to winPizza Hutgift certificates from her school.[4]By the age of 17, she had written and staged her first play inRed Bank, New Jersey.[5]After graduating fromHolmdel High Schoolin 1995, she attendedLafayette CollegeinEaston, Pennsylvania. Unable to afford the tuition fees, she soon transferred toMontclair State UniversityinMontclair, New Jersey, where she earned aBAin English with a minor in theater.[5][6]
After moving toNew York City, Scafaria wrote and directed a play at the Producer's Club Theatre calledThat Guy and Others Like Him, in which she also acted. She had a small role in the acclaimed short filmBullet in the Brain, which won awards at festivals and was produced by CJ Follini.[5]Her writing agent had still yet to find her a job, so she took on more acting roles, appearing in many theater productions in addition to films such asBig Helium DogandA Million Miles.
Seeking new representation for her writing career, she sent out queries to 20 different agents; one of the agents who replied said that they required her to move toLos Angeles. Although she did not anticipate real success with the agent, she moved there and became roommates with screenwriter Bryan Sipe, whom she had previously met while making a film in her native New Jersey.[5]Neither of their work was considered "commercial" enough by studios, so they paired up to write a children's adventure film calledLegend Has It. The screenplay was purchased byRevolution Studios; however, after the studio asked the pair to make changes to the script which Scafaria described as "far less interesting", the project was shelved.[5]
In 2005, Scafaria was hired byFocus Featuresto adapt the bookNick & Norah's Infinite Playlistinto afilm of the same name.[5]It was her ninth screenplay but her first adaptation.[7]She toldMovieMaker, "I grew up in suburban New Jersey, so I immediately identified with the characters, especially Norah. Everything from feeling uncomfortable in my own skin to having a father who's larger than life (even if only in your mind), her plight really spoke to me and seemed like it would speak to a lot of young girls. It wasn't hard to get inside the characters' heads—the authors' voices are so strong." She said the filmBefore Sunrisewas a big inspiration for the structure of her adaptation and said that she wanted to bring a nostalgic take on the teen comedy: "It was just a real challenge to kind of bring it back to those movies that I grew up on in the '80s,John Hughesmovies andCameron Crowe."[8]
In 2012, the "Fempire" (a trio of writers consisting of Scafaria and her close friendsDiablo CodyandLiz Meriwether)[7]received theAthena Film FestivalAward for Creativity and Sisterhood.[9][10]Scafaria wrote theIraq WardocudramaSweet ReliefforParamount PicturesandThe Mighty Flynn, a spec script which she set up atWarner Brothers.[11]She also wrote the filmMan and Wife, which hadGabriele Muccinoattached to direct.[11]
During the2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Scafaria recorded an album calledGarden Party, featuring original songs she sang and played on the piano.[7]The 2009 filmWhip It!features her song "28" in the closing credits. She released her second album,Laughter and Forgetting, in April 2010.
In 2009, Mandate Pictures bought Scafaria's scriptSeeking a Friend for the End of the World,[12]a romantic comedy focusing on a man's quest for a meaningful connection during the apocalypse. It was the first film Scafaria also directed, and was released in June 2012. In an interview, she said, "Two people at the end of the world—all the chaos that's around them that they're sort of wheeling through—and obviously some people are just mowing their lawn and other people are doing heroin... but there's something to me that becomes even more romantic, and that's what I was excited to explore and see. I love relationships. I love intimate stories about people; whether it's a guy and a girl or whatever it is, I like intimate stories of people and how they relate to each other."[13]
In 2015, Scafaria wrote and directed the comedy-drama filmThe Meddler.[14]The film tells the story of a mother and daughter trying to move on with life after the loss of their husband and father. Scafaria toldThe New York Times, "There's a reason that it's all from [the daughter] Marnie's perspective because I never wanted to get a break from her. More than anything I wanted it to inspire empathy from people who might find themselves in this situation, whether it's through loss or some other circumstance that creates strife. Once I started showing people the script, that there was something so relatable about being the adult child of someone and trying to stay best friends."[15]
In 2019, Scafaria wrote and directed the crime drama filmHustlers, which was based on a 2015New Yorkmagazine article byJessica Pressler.[16]The film was a critical and commercial success. Scafaria said toVoxon the real story, "There are a lot of movies that I think have touched upon these themes—The Wolf of Wall Streetor movies likeThe Big Short—which explain [financial downturns] from the bullpen. But I'm really interested in seeing the impact that the 2008 recession had on these women who worked inWall Street's backyard." When mentioning the relationship between Destiny and Ramona, she said, "It felt like there was something more in between the lines—the story of these two women who became friends and formed this business together, and then here they are being interviewed separately years later."[17]In a 2019 interview, the real-life stripper who went through the events of the film told her side of the story and discussed how accurate it was while praising Scafaria.[18]
Between 2021 and 2023, Scafaria directed three episodes of theHBOseriesSuccession. For its third season, she directed the episode "Too Much Birthday",[19]for which she received aDirectors Guild of America Awardnomination forOutstanding Directorial Achievement in Dramatic Series[20]as well as aPrimetime Emmy Awardnomination forOutstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[21]For the fourth and final season of the series, Scafaria directed the episodes "Honeymoon States" and "Living+",[22]with the latter earning her another nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[23]
