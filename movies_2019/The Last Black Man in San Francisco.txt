Jimmie Fails is a young man living inBayview–Hunters Point, San Francisco. He spends his time wandering around town with his best friend Montgomery (Mont) Allen, with whom he lives, along with Mont's grandfather. Jimmie waits for the bus with Mont every day, during which they see various states of change in the city and protesters trying to stop it. They skateboard to aVictorian housein the city'sFillmore Districtwhere Jimmie grew up. Jimmie says it was built by his grandfather in 1946, who opted to build on an empty lot rather than buy one of the houses made available due to the wartimeinternment of Japanese Americans. The home is currently occupied by an older white couple. Jimmie often laments to Mont about how they don't take care of the house, and does his best to maintain it himself. One day, Jimmie and Mont visit the house to find the woman crying on her husband's shoulder and movers taking the couple's things away. They learn from a mover that the woman's mother died and that she and her sister are now fighting over the house.
Jimmie and Mont visit Clayton Newsom, a realtor, to inquire about the home. Newsom is not aware of the current situation, but is very familiar with the house. He tells them it "sounds like an estate thing" in which case the home might stay empty for years until the inheritance is settled. Jimmie and Mont use this opportunity to visit the now-vacant house, exploring it in its entirety. Deciding to take up residence there, they visit Jimmie's aunt Wanda, who gives them the furniture she and the family had when they lived there. With the help of Wanda's husband Ricky, they take everything back to the house and move it in.
One night, Mont invites Kofi, a childhood friend of Jimmie's and his, to the house, and they enjoy a night of relaxation. However, the next day, Kofi says hurtful things to Jimmie about his father in order to appear dominant after being called "effeminate" by his friends. Jimmie and Mont later learn from Kofi's friends that Kofi has been killed by a man with whom he had a scuffle. On returning to the house, they find that their possessions have been thrown out onto the sidewalk, and find a For Sale sign posted by Newsom. Feeling betrayed, Jimmie retaliates by taking all the furniture back inside. He also visits a bank in an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the home. Mont, however, goes back to Newsom, who reveals that the house wasn't built by Jimmie's grandfather; he has the deed proving that it was actually built in the 1850s.
Mont writes a play about the aftermath of Kofi's death, and Jimmie advertises that it will be performed in the house's uppermost tower. On the day of the performance, Jimmie's estranged father appears. During the performance, Mont shows social media posts about Kofi's death, all of which prove, he proclaims, that these people never really knew Kofi. He asks people in the crowd to recount their opinions of Kofi, including Jimmie. Jimmie says that even though the last things Kofi said to him were mean, his experience with him in a group home was friendly, and says, "People aren't one thing". Mont then confronts Jimmie with the truth that Jimmie's grandfather did not build the house. This angers Jimmie, who storms out, followed by the rest of the audience. Jimmie reflects with Wanda, and she reassures him that he can leave San Francisco, as "But if you leave it's not your loss. It's San Francisco's".
Jimmie reunites with Mont at the dock, admitting that he'd known all along that his grandfather hadn't built the house. He watches TV with Mont and Grandpa Allen before going to bed. Mont wakes up and finds Jimmie gone, with a note saying he "didn't know how to say goodbye" and thanking Mont for being his best friend. Mont is left alone, and while he continues various activities that the two always shared, they no longer bring him the same joy when done alone. He stands alone on the dock, staring into the distance. Jimmie is far away, rowing in the water outside theGolden Gate Bridge.
Talbot and Fails grew up together in San Francisco and first discussed the possibility of making the movie as teenagers.[6]However, they found it difficult to make the film in the city due to the lack of a film scene within the region[7]and neither of them had any proper film training nor knew anybody within the industry.[8]Talbot got some initial advice on how to start from a cold email toBarry Jenkins, who shotMedicine for Melancholy(2008) in San Francisco, before he left to shootMoonlight(2016).[8]
In May 2015, the two shot a preview trailer to raise funds for the making of the film and launched a successfulKickstartercampaign that ultimately surpassed their goal of $50,000 by more than $25,000.[9]Within a month, 1,500 contributors backed the campaign totaling a little over $75,000.[10]The campaign garnered film industry interest as well as national press, and through viral success cemented Fails, who was the face of the #lastblackman fundraising campaign, as a local San Francisco figure.[9]
When Fails and Talbot's short film,American Paradise, made it to2017 Sundance Film Festival, they metChristina OhofPlan B Entertainment, who later made introductions for Talbot and producer, Khaliah Neal, to the rest of the company at a shooting forAd Astra(2019).[11]Jeremy Kleiner, of Plan B, helped pick up the film for production.[11]Principal photographybegan in April 2018.[12]
In May 2018, it was officially announced thatJonathan Majors,Danny Glover,Tichina Arnold,Rob Morgan,Mike Epps,Finn Wittrock, andThora Birchhad joined the cast of the film, with Khaliah Neal producing the film alongside Plan B Entertainment andA24distributing.[13][14]
The creative team had wanted to cast someone from San Francisco in the role of Kofi, the childhood friend who struggles to be vulnerable with his peers.[15]They met Jamal Trulove at an after-school program in San Francisco while casting for child extras.[15]Trulove was previously falsely charged with murdering his friend in 2007. He was granted a retrial in 2015 and was subsequently acquitted. TheSan Francisco Board of Supervisorslater approved a $13.1 million settlement to him for being framed for murder by the police.[16]Given his background and personal resonance for the role, Trulove was cast on the spot that day.[15]
One of the filming locations wasShipwright's Cottage.[17]Constant demolitions and alterations of San Francisco sites complicated the film production. Talbot is cognizant of the geographical inaccuracies of the film, likening it toBullitt(1968) which was also filmed in San Francisco.[18]
The film was heavily influenced by the 2001 filmGhost World, also about two outsider friends who don't fit in to their cities and wander throughout, which Talbot was introduced to at age 15.[19]As an homage to that film, Talbot asked actressThora Birchto appear in a cameo, and notes the connection between her character of Enid and that of Jimmie: "I always felt her character and Jimmy are similar in a lot of ways, and she got that immediately," Talbot said. "She and I would joke like, at the end ofGhost Worldwhen she gets on the bus, it’s like she never got off the bus and wound up in San Francisco working a tech job she hates."[20]Talbot also discussed the connection further: "Thora is one of the great actresses of her generation and her work, in part, inspired me to want to make films. Her performance in Ghost World made me feel seen as a teenager when I was a bit lost," Talbot explained. "At the end of that film, Thora rides a bus off into the sunset. In our film, we meet her character on a bus in the heart of San Francisco—almost as if she kept riding it all these years, and somehow wound up in the Bay Area working a tech job she loathed. Her exchange that follows with Jimmie, however brief, has been written about and quoted more than any other part of the film."[21]
The film had its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 26, 2019.[22]It was released in the United States by A24 on June 7, 2019[3][2][23]having previously been scheduled to be released on June 14.[24]It was released on VOD byLionsgate Home Entertainmenton August 13, 2019.[2][23]
The Last Black Man in San Franciscogrossed $4.5 million in United States and Canada[3]and $122,123 in other territories for a total worldwide of $4.6 million, against a production budget of $3 million.[2]
On thereview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 212 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "An affecting story powerfully told,The Last Black Man in San Franciscoimmediately establishes director Joe Talbot as a filmmaker to watch."[23]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[25]
In herNew York Timesreview,Manohla Dargismade the film a NYT Critics Pick and called it "ravishing, haunting and exultant."[26]TheLos Angeles Times'sJustin Changcalled the film "a gorgeous, moving ode to a city in flux."[27]The Hollywood Reporter'sTodd McCarthysaid it was "by far the best narrative film I saw [at Sundance]. ... Every scene is fresh and unpredictable, visual poetry and realism are exquisitely woven together."[28]Rolling Stonecalled it "the best movie of the year" as of June 2019,[29]andDeadline Hollywood's awards columnist Pete Hammond said that it was "the one movie I have seen that should have Oscar written all over it" as of July.[30]
The New Yorker'sRichard Brodysaid that the film was disappointing and lacked "grit or texture of real experience."[31]
The Last Black Man in San Franciscoappeared on many critics' lists of the best films of 2019, including:

Guests on the podcast have includedBo Burnham,Sofia Coppola,Paul Schrader,Martin Scorsese, andAlia Shawkat. Despite lacking any pre-defined structure, episodes generally contain discussions around recent works of the two guests, allowing for branching discussions to other areas. The first two guests wereBarry Jenkins(director of A24'sMoonlight) andGreta Gerwig(director of A24'sLady Bird), who both discussed what it's like to make a movie about the place they grew up.[39]As of October 18, 2023, 38 episodes have been released.[40][41][42]

In May 2023,Leonine Studios, a German independent film distributor, partnered with A24 to set up a joint label called "A24 | Leonine Studios", which will distribute films in Austria and Germany.[55]The next month, it was reported that formerDisney General EntertainmentChairmanPeter Ricesigned a deal with A24 as an independent producer, agreeing to co-finance films for global distribution.[56]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, A24 was approved to continue filming and promotional activities since they do not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP).[57]
In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good.

I didn't think it was a difficult transition. Acting is a platform that can become a conveyer for ideas. Art is a way of understanding, of confronting issues and confronting your own feelings—all within that realm of the capacity it represents. It may have been a leap of faith for me, given not only my learning disability (dyslexia) but also the fact that I felt awkward. I felt all the things that someone that's 6'3" or 6'4" feels and with my own diminished expectations of who I could be [and] would feel. Whether it's art, acting or theater that I've devoted myself to I put more passion and more energy into it.[11]

Making US$39 million in the U.S. (against a budget of US$28 million),[21]Hocus Pocuswas not considered a financial success, but quickly developed a sizeablecult followingdue to strong home video sales and television re-runs.[22][23]"I think the most surreal thing is that it keeps getting more popular instead of the other way around", Birch later said, while admitting the experience was "the most amount of fun I've ever had on a set".[24]
In the 1994 comedyMonkey Trouble, Birch portrayed a girl who befriends aCapuchin monkey. In a positive review for theAustin Chronicle, Marjorie Baumgarten observed that Birch's "nuanced performance (a rarity amongst child performers) no doubt lendsMonkey Troubleits realistic touch".[25]That same year, she reprised herPatriot Gamesrole in its sequel,Clear and Present Danger, which grossed over US$215 million globally.[26]She was then cast as "Teeny" Tercell in the 1995 coming-of-age dramaNow and Then. The film was largely dismissed by critics upon release,[27]but has since been recognised as a milestone of its genre.[28]Next, Birch headlined the adventure filmAlaska(1996), playing one of two siblings who cross the Alaskan wilderness in search of their lost father. TheAustin Chroniclefound it to be a "decent kids' adventure movie" with an "impeccable" performance by Birch.[29]For the next two years, she did not appear on film but guest-starred in episodes ofPromised LandandTouched by an Angel.
Birch appeared in several projects in 1999: firstly, the made-for-television filmNight Ride Home, where she played a teenager grieving the loss of her older brother. Writing forVariety, David Kronke called it "a thoughtful and sensitive examination of how a family copes with grief", and said of the performances, "De Mornay… digs deep and comes up with a character that seems true;Burstynand Birch competently complement [her]".[30]Next, she played the small, uncredited role of Mary inAnywhere but Here.
Birch's portrayal of insecure teenager Jane Burnham inAmerican Beauty,Sam Mendes' darkdramedyabout the struggles of a middle class household, was roundly praised by critics,[31][32]withPeter TraversofRolling Stonewriting that she"[glimmered]with grown-up radiance".[33]The performance earned her aBAFTAnomination forBest Supporting Actress,[34]while the film was the recipient of the 1999Academy Award for Best Pictureand grossed over US$356 million worldwide,[35][36]emerging as the biggest commercial success of Birch's career to date.[37]She later said of the experience, "There was a lot of therapy involved … A lot of opening up and sharing things from our own lives about why we related to these characters. Everybody brought a lot of themselves to it. I knowAnnettedid a lot of research about women becoming obsessed with the self-help realm.Kevinwas working out obsessively and already in the headspace of [his character] Lester, even in rehearsals. And then there wasWes,Menaand I, who were these kids just incredibly excited to be there and watching [these] masters at their craft — just trying to absorb as much as we could from them".[38]
Following the success ofAmerican Beauty, Birch appeared in two films released in 2000: low-budget dramaThe Smokers, in which Birch was called "a scene-stealer" byThe Hollywood Reporter,[39]andDungeons & Dragons, a poorly-received adaptation of the fantasyrole-playing game of the same name.[40]British horror filmThe Holecame next, where she starred as Elizabeth Dunn, a devious schoolgirl who lures her friends into an underground bunker. In a mixed review forVariety,Derek Elleystated that Birch gave "an effectively creepy lead [performance]", but called the film "clunky" in its "attempt to merge the psychothriller and teen movie genres".[41]
Birch's next project was the satirical 2001 comedyGhost World, directed byTerry Zwigoff. Based on thegraphic novel of the same name, the film was released to an enthusiastic critical reception and developed a loyal cult following.[42][43][2]James Berardinellifound Birch's part to be her "first effectively developed role" sinceAmerican Beauty, commending the actress for the "quirkiness [and the] underlying sense of melancholy and ennui" in her portrayal ofEnid Coleslaw.[44]Meanwhile, A. O. Scott said in his appraisal forThe New York Times:
Thora Birch, whose performance as Lester Burnham's alienated daughter was the best thing aboutAmerican Beauty,plays a similar character here, with even more intelligence and restraint. Enid's capacity for scorn is unlimited: her plucked eyebrows might illustrate a dictionary entry for "supercilious," and her quiet voice shoots darts of sarcasm in every direction.[45]
Birch received various accolades forGhost World,[15]including a nomination for the 2002Golden Globe Award for Best Actress.[46]
In 2003, she appeared as thetitle characterin the biographical television filmHomeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story, starring as a young woman who, after becoming homeless at 15 amid personal tragedies, decides to finish her schooling. Birch's performance earned her a nomination for theEmmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actressthat year.[47]
Birch played a supporting role inSilver City, a political satire directed byJohn Sayles, which premiered at the2004 Cannes Film Festival. Theindependentfeature received mixed reviews, butEmpire'sAngie Errigo thought Birch's portrayal of whistleblower Karen Cross was "terrific".[48]She co-starred in the crime dramaSlingshotthe following year.
InDark Corners(2006), a psychological horror-thriller about a young woman who wakes up one day as a different person, Birch starred in the dual role of Susan Hamilton and Karen Clarke. The film received a mixed reception, with Adam DiLeo ofIGNpraising its surreal,David Lynch-style elements, but criticizing Birch's performance.[49]She followed this with roles in two more genre films:Train—a loose remake of the 1980 slasher filmTerror Train, released in 2008—and the psychological thrillerDeadline, in which she co-starred withBrittany Murphy, who died shortly after the film's release in December 2009.[50]Birch later revealed she had been concerned about Murphy's wellbeing during filming.[51]
In the true crime dramaWinter of Frozen Dreams(2009), Birch played Barbara Hoffman, a Wisconsin prostitute convicted of murder in the first-ever televised murder trial.[52]In a review forBloody Disgusting, John Marrone described Birch's "alluring" performance as the highlight of the film.[53]Next, she took on the role of journalist Sidney Bloom inThe Pregnancy Pact, aLifetimemovie based on the true story of a group of high schoolers inGloucester, Massachusetts, who plotted to get pregnant at the same time and raise their children communally.[54]The film was watched by 5.9 million viewers when it premiered in January 2010.[55]Later that year, Birch was cast—in what would have been her stage debut—asLucyin theoff-Broadwayrevival ofHamilton Deane'sDracula,[56]but was subsequently dismissed from the production for the alleged behavior of her father—her manager at the time—who was reported to have physically threatened one of the show's cast members during a rehearsal.[6]
Birch played the role of Vivian inPetunia(2012), an independent dramedy depicting the lives and romantic relationships of a dysfunctional New York family. Birch, who is credited as one of its producers,[51]described the "intimate [and] honest" feature as "a little bit different".[57]Given a small theatrical release in the U.S.,[58]the film garnered mixed reviews,[59]though Birch and the rest of the ensemble were praised.[60][61]
After devoting herself to academic pursuits, which included securing a degree in legal studies throughKaplan University,[62]Birch returned to acting in 2015 with a recurring role as software engineer Morgan on the first season ofUSA Network'sColony.[63]It was later revealed that Birch would not return for the second season  because of a scheduling conflict, and that the part had been recast.[64]
Birch starred as a left-wing activist in the 2018 political thrillerAffairs of State, which Noel Murray ofThe Los Angeles Timescalled "refreshingly smart".[65]In a less favorable review forForbes, Luke Y. Thompson wrote, "[cinematographer] Horacio Marquinez gamely films everything like it's an art movie, though there's one scene in which he shoots Birch so unflatteringly that you wonder what she must have done to make him mad".[66]She headlined and co-producedThe Competitionthat same year, an independent romantic comedy.[67]
Next, Birch starred in the 2018 dramaThe Etruscan Smile—an adaptation ofJosé Luis Sampedro'snovel—which was filmed in Scotland and received strong reviews.[68][69]The following year, she played a supporting role in the crime thrillerAbove Suspicion, which—afterPatriot GamesandClear and Present Dangerin the 1990s—marked her third collaboration with directorPhillip Noyce. In a positive review forThe Guardian,Peter Bradshawcommented, "There's an interesting cameo from Thora Birch [as the] long-suffering Jolene".[70]
Birch's cameo appearance inThe Last Black Man in San Francisco(2019), a drama about a young man's pursuit to reclaim the Victorian home built by his grandfather, was considered a crucial part of the film's success.[3]Speaking of her casting and the symbolic nature of the part, directorJoe Talbotsaid:
Thora is one of the great actresses of her generation and her work, in part, inspired me to want to make films. Her performance inGhost Worldmade me feel seen as a teenager when I was a bit lost. At the end of that film, [she] rides a bus off into the sunset. In our film, we meet her character on a bus in the heart of San Francisco—almost as if she kept riding it all these years, and somehow wound up in theBay Areaworking a tech job she loathed. Her exchange that follows with [main character] Jimmie, however brief, has been written about and quoted more than any other part of the film.[3]
The film premiered at theSundance Film Festivalin January 2019, where it won awards for Best Directing and a Special Jury Prize for Creative Collaboration.[71]It was released theatrically in the U.S. byA24.
Between 2019–2020, Birch appeared in the role of Mary (aka "Gamma") on thetenth seasonofAMC's post-apocalyptic horror seriesThe Walking Dead,[72]withCollidercommenting that she brought "emotional depth" to the part.[73]Birch called the experience "a fun, massive thing to have been a part of".[62]Next, in the independent drama13 Minutes(2021), she played a single mother struggling to keep her family together in the wake of a destructive tornado.Rex ReedofThe New York Observerfelt that the film succeeded on the strength of its "compelling" and "likable" ensemble, singling out Birch as a highlight.[74]
Birch made her directorial debut in 2022 withThe Gabby Petito Story, a Lifetime television movie in which she also co-starred.[4]The film is based on the2021 disappearanceof Petito, a 22-year-old who was murdered by her boyfriend during a cross-country drive. Birch said she had been wanting to direct since she was "nine or ten years old" and that it was the subject matter which drew her to the project: "There's an element of abusive relationships in this story that I think so many of us can relate to … [it] captured the entire nation's attention in the middle ofCovid… Everyone stopped and took a minute and [said] "Where’s Gabby? What happened to Gabby?" That kind of fascination and focus point was something that I thought was a third character in [the] story".[75]The ethical nature of dramatizing such recent events was met with public criticism,[76]especially as the film—which premiered on October 12, 2022, just over one year after Petito's death—was made without the involvement of the Petito family.[76]
Also in 2022, Birch played Audrey Beach in the ten-part fictional podcastOverleaper,[77]an espionage-style thriller about a female soldier embarking on a top-secret mission. Birch said it was the idea of "a return to the old radio dramas … from the [1920s and '30s]", as well as the luxury of acting with her voice and not having to endure "the harsh physical positions that the character is in", which drew her to the project.[78]
It was announced at the2023 Cannes Film Festivalthat Birch's next project as director—her feature debut—will be an adaptation ofElmore Leonard's novelMr. Paradise, making her the first woman to direct a Leonard adaptation.[79]
Birch married talent manager andphilanthropistMichael Benton Adler on December 21, 2018.[80][81]Birch is a long-timeDemocratwho was a delegate at the2012 Democratic National Convention.[82][83]She has supportedJoe Bidenand local political efforts, such asCongressmanWiley Nickel's campaign.[84][85]
