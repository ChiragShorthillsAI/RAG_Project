StarringMaya Erskine,Jack Quaid,Beck Bennett,Rosalind Chao,Perrey Reeves, andEd Begley Jr., the film follows two longtime single friends who agree to be each other's plus one at every wedding they're invited to.
The film premiered at theTribeca Film Festivalon April 28, 2019, where it won the Narrative Audience Award, and was released on June 14, 2019 byRLJE Films. It received generally positive reviews from critics.
Ben King and Alice Mori, friends from college and now in their late twenties, separately attend a wedding between their friends, Matt and Amanda. Having recently broken up with her boyfriend, Nate, Alice gets drunk.
Ben is fixated on former classmate Jess Ramsey and hopes to establish a romantic relationship with her. However, he embarrasses himself when she rebuffs his attempt to kiss her, as she is engaged. At the hotel, Ben and Alice vent their frustrations of having to navigate wedding season alone and decide to help one another by becoming each other's dates. Alice also agrees to help Ben meet women at the weddings.
Ben goesgolfingwith his dad, Chuck, who has proposed to his much younger girlfriend, Gina, asking Ben to be hisbest man. Citing Chuck's two previous failed marriages, Ben suggests his dad take some time to think about his decision.
Alice uses blunt approaches to introduce Ben to various single women at the weddings, one of which culminates in Ben having aone-night-stand. However, he says that he thinks he won't pursue anything further, remaining fixated on finding the "perfect" relationship instead of having casual flings.
After another wedding, Ben and Alice are forced to share a bed. When she attempts to cuddle with him, he feels uncomfortable. The pair attend a wedding for one of Ben's family members, and he and Alice nearly drunkenly kiss in the pool after a deep conversation.
In the conversation, Alice learns that Ben has been asked to be his dad's best man, and expresses concern as to why he did not tell her or accept the offer. He expresses his frustrations with his dad, explaining he still feels resentment over his parents' divorce. Alice tells him that her parents are only remaining together for her and her sister despite their clear displeasure with each other, which is not better.
They miss the shuttle back to the hotel and are forced to walk, eventually cutting through a cemetery. They run through the cemetery together, but Alice trips and cuts her arm. As Ben helps her, they embrace and have sex. The pair awkwardly have breakfast the following morning and decide not to discuss the previous night.
Weeks later, Ben and Alice travel toHawaiifor a destination wedding and acknowledge their mutual feelings, having sex again. The pair decide to become formally romantically involved. Ben later gains Alice's parents' approval after helping make her sister's wedding a success.
As Ben and Alice attend another wedding, they get into an argument over her forgetting the wedding gift, her nonchalant attitude frustrating Ben. Ben steps outside to cool off so they don't fight publicly. Outside of the wedding, Alice confronts Ben and asks why he's so frustrated. He confesses that he's been having doubts about their relationship. Alice tells Ben that she loves him, but Ben can only tell Alice "I don't know" when asked if he loves her back. Alice tells Ben that he's not a good person and walks away, their relationship ending.
Ben attends the remainder of weddings alone and makes a drunken fool of himself at one of them, prompting his friend, Matt, to intervene. After some discussion about marriage not requiring 100% certainty that the relationship will work out, Ben realizes his mistake and shows up to a wedding Alice previously invited him to, finding that she is back with Nate. He attempts to explain himself to her and professes his love, but before she can respond, Nate finds her and the two return to the wedding.
Later that night, Chuck calls Ben for a ride after takingacidduring hisbachelor party. Ben tells his father that his divorce is why Ben is so fixated on finding the perfect person, not wanting to make a mistake and wind up alone. Chuck explains that even though his previous marriages have failed, they still led to great things, like Ben.
At Chuck's wedding, Ben, as the best man, gives a heartfelt speech to his dad and his newstepmotherGina. During the speech, the camera pans to reveal that Alice is there too. It's revealed that when Ben returns home after helping his father, he finds Alice waiting for him. They kiss and get back together.

This proved so rich that the role grew beyond even the writers' expectations.[35]Begley Jr. said about his future TV chief of surgery, "I was a huge fan of Bill Daniels. I had seen him inTwo for the Road. I had seen him inThe Graduate, and inParallax View. He was an actor I just thought the world of. He played these 'Type A' personalities quite effectively, but (in real life) he is the sweetest guy in the world." He also added: "He is an actor I just thought the world of. I had no delusions about how my character came to be. I rode on the coattails of Bill Daniels... the kind of Mutt and Jeff routine of Dr. Craig looking up and berating a 6 foot 4 doctor Victor Ehrlich. So I owe all my success on the show to Bill Daniels."[36]After the series was canceled, the two still remained friends, living not too far away from each other.

BeforeSt. Elsewherein the early 1980s, the struggling and unknown Begley metNorman Lloyd, who became a mentor to him while Lloyd was directing an episode ofTales of the Unexpected. The two became friends. In a 2014 interview with Jimmy Falcon of Cloverleaf Radio, he said this about Lloyd:
Not only did I enjoy working with him, but I see him fairly regularly. I just had dinner with him 4 nights ago.  We had dinner together at Sarah Nichols's house, his neighbor of mine and friend of his. We had a lovely time and reminisced – he's unbelievable. He's going to be 100 years old this year—and still very active, getting around on his own. He's a force of nature, so Norman Lloyd was somebody I idolized. When I was quite young, wow, James Dean is great and this is one and that.  Now look at Janis Joplin, what a great voice and Jim Morrison, those people left us so young, like my point of view has change somewhere, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, saying, 'No, you idolized Jimmy Stewart, Gloria Swanson.' The people that have families and happiness and a long, economy life. You know, Norman Lloyd, he wasn't much older than me, when I didSt. Elsewhere, and I went 'These are my role models, now, people had a long/happy life and continued to be creative.' Those are my role models, not the people that left us so early and I'm sorry they did, I don't mean to trifle with that, but, my role models changed from the people who had an incredible, brief spurt of creativity and life, but to people that went the distance, they became my role models at some point in my early 30s really.[37]
On November 9, 2014, along with formerSt. Elsewhereco-stars, Begley attended Lloyd's 100th birthday inLos Angeles. Begley said, "I worked with Norman Lloyd the actor, and Norman Lloyd the director, and no one informed me better on the art of storytelling than that talented man. He is a constant inspiration and my eternal friend."[38]
