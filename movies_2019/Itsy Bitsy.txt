Itsy Bitsyis a 2019 American horror film directed byMicah Gallo, starringBruce Davison, Elizabeth Roberts, Arman Darbo, and Chloe Perrin, and featuringDenise Crosby,Eileen Dietz, andMatty Cardarople. It centers on a family, who moves into an old, secluded mansion where they are stalked by an ancient entity that takes the form of a giant spider. The film itself was inspired by the poemThe Itsy Bitsy Spider, and was released in the United States on August 30, 2019, byShout! Studios, and it has received mixed reviews from critics.
Live-in nurseKara and her two children Jesse and Cambria have moved into the home of artifact collector and widower Walter Clark, who has recently purchased a fabled artifact, the ‘Black Egg of Maa-Kalaratri'. During the purchase Clark angered thetreasure hunter, who returns to the home and smashes the relic. This releases a large prehistoric spider, which bites the treasure hunter, who manages to make it off the property before dying.
The move has been difficult for Kara, as she blames herself for the death of her son Stevie from a car accident where she was the driver. She is also hiding a secret drug addiction. To calm herself and deal with visions of her son Stevie, Kara steals Walter'sOxyContinbut still experiences a nervous breakdown in a diner. She is reassured by and bonds with Sheriff Jane Dunne, who notices Kara's addiction.
Jesse begins to bond with Walter and the two piece together the relic. Walter also entertains the boy by telling him the legend of Maa-Kalaratri, an ancient spider goddess who became vengeful when people stopped worshipping her. As he is having fun, Jesse neglects to watch Cambria, who is nearly attacked by the spider. This is discovered by Kara, causing a fight between her and Jesse, during which he reveals that Kara had been fired for stealing medication from her last job.
Kara's theft is eventually discovered and she is fired by Walter. She leaves, at which point the spider attacks and kills Walter. Jane responds to reports of his death after Jesse discovers the body. She questions Kara, who believes that it may have something to do with the treasure hunter while Jesse believes that it was Maa-Kalaratri. Kara later scolds Jesse for scaring Cambria and slaps him, an act she quickly regrets.
Later that night Kara investigates the attic, discovering Jesse freeing Cambria from thick spider webs. They discover an empty exoskeleton shed by the spider and flee the attic, at which point the spider attacks and bites Kara, who passes out from the venom. Jesse manages to call Jane for help but is unable to prevent the spider from biting Cambria's hand before seemingly knocking it unconscious. Kara awakens and finds that the spider bit clean through the child's hand and was unable to inject any venom. She manages to administer an epinephrine shot on herself to counteract the spider venom before passing out once more.
Jesse is attacked, and narrowly avoids being bitten before Kara reawakens in time to kill the spider. The trio escape and as Jane arrives with an ambulance, Kara collapses and sees a vision of Stevie. She then finally forgives herself for his death by saving Jesse and Cambria, taking away her need to use drugs. After recovering, Kara and the children move out and swear to stay together no matter what. Unbeknownst to them, however, the spider laid two egg sacs in Walter's house, one in a dollhouse and one in a chest, both of which begin to hatch.
On April 8, 2019, it was announced thatShout! Studiosacquired the North American distribution rights to the film.[1][2]The film was released in select theatres, digital and onVODon August 30, 2019.[3][4][5]
Itsy Bitsyreceived mixed reviews from critics upon its release, with many praising the special effects, cinematography, and atmosphere while criticizing the film's uninteresting characters, and story.
OnRotten Tomatoesthe film has an approval rating of 60% based on reviews from 10 critics, with an average rating of 5.5/10.[6]
Matthew Roe ofFilm Threatgave the film a negative review, writing "Itsy Bitsyhas some fantastic human moments inside its bland monster facade and is the only real reason I can recommend the film – however, for some it won’t be enough to redeem the played-out and wonky elements."[7]Culture Cryptrated the film a score of 55 out of 100, criticizing its underwritten characters, script, and finale. The reviewer concluded, "Itsy Bitsyisn’t going to win any awards or become anyone’s favorite film.  It’s too grim to grab the gusto it needs to stand out without edging into over-the-top outrageousness.  But it is professionally produced, features a few intriguing pops, and makes for a decent diversion during a weekend’s entertainment."[8]Veronique Englebert fromThe Review Geekscored the film a mixed 5.5 out of 10, writing, "Itsy Bitsyis not a bad spider movie but it’s not a particularly great one either. It fails to reach the same creepiness found in movies like Arachnophobia and takes a while to get into the swing of things. However, the welcome practical effects and empathetic characters help but can’t quite save the day for this average creature feature."[9]
Meagan Navarro fromBloody Disgustingcommended the film's special effects and camerawork; but criticized the sparse appearance of its antagonist, unresolved ending, and unlikable characters. Concluding her review, Navarro recommended the film based on the special effect, in spite of its faults, calling it "a big step in the right direction".[10]Noel Murrayof theLos Angeles Timesgave the film a positive review, praising the film's gothic atmosphere, special effects, and "existential dread".[11]

In 1987, Crosby was cast in the role of Tasha Yar for the much-publicized return ofStar Trekto television in the syndicated seriesStar Trek: The Next Generation. She had been chosen to play CounselorDeanna TroibeforeGene Roddenberryswitched the roles thatMarina Sirtisand she had originally been given. Initially one of the top-billed characters and featured prominently in episodes such as "The Naked Now" and "Code of Honor", the role of Tasha gradually moved into the background as other members of the ensemble cast became a greater focus of the series. Crosby reportedly grew disillusioned with her role because of its "Uhura-like" status: "I was struggling with not being able to do much with the character. I had all these ideas and couldn't do them. I was just stage dressing."[6]Ultimately, Crosby decided to leave the show. Her character was killed by the alien creature Armus during the episode "Skin of Evil". She had appeared in 22 episodes when she left.
In later years, Crosby approached theTNGproduction team with the idea of reprising her role of Tasha Yar.[7]This came to be in season-three's "Yesterday's Enterprise", in which an alternate timeline is created after theUSSEnterprise-C, the predecessor to TNG'sUSSEnterprise-D, comes forward 22 years in time, just before it was to be destroyed. Yar joined theEnterprise-C before it returned to its own time to restore the original timeline. During the documentaryTrekkies, Crosby commented that her Tasha Yar character had to die to get "the best episodes".
Crosby also guest-starred in several otherTNGepisodes, including "Redemption" and "Unification" as Romulan CommanderSela, the half-human, half-Romulandaughter of Tasha Yar, who had been taken prisoner in the past while on board theEnterprise-C. Crosby later reprised the role in theStar Trek: Armadavideo game, and played Tasha again in the series finale, "All Good Things...", in whichCaptain Picardis moving back and forth through time, and encounters Tasha during the events just prior to the pilot episode.
Crosby co-produced and narrated the 1997 documentaryTrekkies, followed by the 2003 sequelTrekkies 2. Both films star Crosby, who conducts interviews with devotees ofStar Trek, more commonly known as "Trekkies". As of 2017[update], she was reportedly working on a sequel calledTrekkies 3.[8]
Along with otherStar Trekactors, she has also appeared in the "Blood and Fire" episode of the fan-produced seriesStar Trek: New Voyages, playing Dr. Jenna Yar (grandmother of Tasha Yar).
In 2013, Crosby provided voicing for the characters of Tasha Yar and Sela in theCryptic StudiosMMORPGStar Trek Online. Crosby became the first of a new wave of severalStar Trekalumni to return to the roles they originated sinceLeonard Nimoy's participation at the game's launch in 2010.
In January and February 2010, Crosby performed alongsideGale Haroldand ex-modelClaudia Masonin Tennessee Williams'Orpheus Descendingat Theater in Los Angeles.

Eileen Dietz(born January 11, 1944) is an American actress who is best known for her appearances in manyhorror filmssuch as the face of thedemoninThe Exorcistand for her portrayal of characters on the soap operasGuiding LightandGeneral Hospital.
As a child, Dietz appeared in commercials with her twin sister Marianne DeFossey, and beginning at the age of 12 she started studying acting at theNeighborhood Playhouse. She made her television debut in 1963 in a small guest role onThe Doctors. Shortly thereafter she landed a recurring role on thesoap operaLove of Life. She made her film debut starring in the 1966 movieTeenage Gang Debsas Ellie. The following year she portrayed Penny Wohl in the critically acclaimedindependent filmDavid Holzman's Diary. The film never got much in the way of theatrical distribution despite having Dietz's nude scene featured in Life Magazine's photo spread and in the book of the film. She did not recall if she auditioned for the role of Penny but she added, "it was a fun shoot."[1]
Dietz spent much of the late 1960s and early 1970s appearing in theatre productions. She notably appearedOff-Broadwayas the Young Girl in the premiere ofBruce Jay Friedman'sSteambathat the Truck and Warehouse Theater in 1970. In 1972, she portrayed an androgynous runaway in the premiere ofJoyce Carol Oates'Ontological Proof of My Existence. Her portrayal in the play led to an invitation to do a screen test forThe Exorcist. She was cast in two memorable roles in the film:Pazuzuthe demon (better known as the face of death), and the 'possessedRegan' (theLinda Blaircharacter) in some scenes. She performed in scenes that were too violent or disturbing for Blair to perform, including the crucifix scene and the fistfight with Father Karras.[2][3]She recalled that directorWilliam Friedkingave her no notes and said, "I wasn't playing a little girl, I was playing the demon that possessed a little girl." Blair, who recalls Friedkin telling her the film would not succeed if she was not in as many shots as possible, estimates that Dietz is in 17 seconds of the film. Dietz, angry that her contribution to the film had been minimized, claimed in the media to have performedallthe possession scenes. Warners ultimately measured her screen presence at 28.25 seconds, but denied that her contribution was dramatically significant.[4]: 75
AfterThe Exorcist, Dietz had a highly active career on television during the 1970s, appearing as a guest star on such shows asPlanet of the Apes,Korg: 70,000 B.C.,Barnaby Jones, andHappy Daysamong others. She also portrayed the recurring role of Linette Waterman in the soap operaThe Guiding Lightand appeared in the filmsYou Light Up My Life(1977) andParts: The Clonus Horror(1979).
