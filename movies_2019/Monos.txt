Monosis a 2019 internationally co-producedwardrama filmdirected byAlejandro Landes, written by Landes andAlexis Dos Santosand produced by Fernando Epstein, Santiago Zapata, Martin Solibakke, Cristina Landes and Landes himself. It starsJulianne NicholsonandMoisés Arias. The film follows a group of teenage soldiers assigned to watch over a hostage. This film was released in the United States on September 13, 2019, byNeonandParticipant, receiving positive reviews from critics.
The film had its world premiere at the2019 Sundance Film Festivalon 26 January 2019, where it won the World Cinema Dramatic Special Jury Award.[6]It was selected as the official Colombian entry for theBest International Feature Filmat the92nd Academy Awardsand theGoya Award for Best Iberoamerican Filmat the34th Goya Awards.[7][8]
On a remote mountaintop, the Monos, a group of teenage commandos identified only by theirnoms de guerre, perform military training exercises while watching over a prisoner of war referred to only as "Doctora". They are visited by the Messenger, a superior in the unnamed Organization they serve, who oversees their drills and instructs them to push themselves harder. Two of the Monos, Lady and Wolf, request permission to enter a romantic relationship, which the Messenger grants. Before departing, he leaves the Monos in charge of a milk cow named Shakira.
Lady and Wolf consummate their relationship, an event the other commandos honor with celebratory gunfire, during which Shakira is inadvertently shot and killed by Dog. The Monos punish Dog by putting him in solitary confinement in a pit and then drag Shakira's body to their camp to strip it for meat. Troop leader Wolf commits suicide. The Monos argue over how to report this to the Messenger via radio; they eventually lie to protect Dog, saying that Wolf killed Shakira and killed himself out of shame. Lady and Rambo have a sexual encounter that night by the fire. With Wolf dead, the Messenger appoints Bigfoot as head of the squad. Over the radio, the Organization's commander asks Doctora questions from her family to confirm that she is alive.
The Monos' base is attacked and Doctora is put under the watch of Swede, who informs her that she will be killed if the opposing forces try to rescue her. While they are alone together, Doctora appeals to Swede's emotions to help her escape and the two embrace when the bunker in which they are hiding is shelled. Swede begins kissing Doctora, who throws her off; Swede then returns to holding her at gunpoint, laughing while crying.
The following day, Bigfoot announces that the Monos were triumphant in the fight and will be relocating to the jungle. Soon after their arrival, Doctora makes an attempt to escape. Bigfoot is enraged, damaging the radio and declaring the Monos independent of the Organization. After Doctora is recaptured, Bigfoot demands that Rambo chain her to a tree. Rambo does so, but begins to cry, further angering Bigfoot.
The Messenger returns to check on the Monos and discovers that Lady and Bigfoot have begun a sexual relationship without approval. He forces the Monos to carry out strenuous exercises and confess to him about one another's misdeeds. Smurf reveals that Dog is the one who killed Shakira, and recounts what Bigfoot said about the Monos' independence. The Messenger announces that he will be taking Bigfoot to be assessed by the Organization's superiors. However, on the motorboat ride there, Bigfoot shoots the Messenger in the back and returns to the jungle camp. Smurf is tied to a tree as punishment for snitching and the Monos double down on their training, robbing several passing motorists.
Rambo tries to free Smurf in the night, but is stopped by Lady. Rambo then runs off alone and attempts to steal a boat, only to be caught by its owner, who is diving for gold in the river. He takes Rambo back to his home, where Rambo meets the man's family and is given food and a bed.
Swede takes the chained Doctora to swim, and soon joins her in the river. Doctora uses the chain to strangle Swede underwater, then breaks the chain with a rock. She returns to the base, finds Smurf tied up, and takes his boots. Smurf begs Doctora to take him with her, but she leaves him.
The Monos track Rambo down and attack the house, killing the man and his wife. As Rambo flees, a television in the background reports that Doctora has been spotted in the jungle, and it is implied she will soon be rescued by authorities. Lady finds the couple's three children hiding under a table while Bigfoot, Boom Boom, and Dog chase Rambo, who jumps into the river. Eventually, Rambo washes up on shore and is picked up by a military helicopter, whose pilots radio ahead that they have found an unidentified person. As the helicopter arrives in a nearby city, one of the soldiers contacts his commander, repeatedly requesting orders about what to do with the captive as Rambo starts to cry.
The film was loosely inspired by the novelsLord of the FliesbyWilliam GoldingandHeart of DarknessbyJoseph Conrad.[9]Filmic influences included the Soviet filmCome and Seeand the French filmBeau Travail.[10]While "monos", the title as well as the code name of the main squad in the film, superficially means "monkeys" in Spanish, it signifies the prefixmono-of Greek origin meaning "alone" or "one" according to Landes.[11][9]As for the subjects of teenage soldiers and theColombian conflict, Landes said:
InMonos, youth serves as a metaphor for Colombia as a nation; it's a young country, still searching for its identity, and the dream of peace is fragile, tentative and recurring. ... It's a stage in life in which we are caught between wanting company and, just as desperately, wanting to be alone.Monoslooks to evoke this angst and conflict from the inside rather than create reactions of pity or outrage in the audience by depicting what could be perceived as a foreign conflict.[9]
A film atypical in Latin America,Monosended up being a co-production between eight countries with support from a variety of institutional funds. Describing the financing process, Landes said, "we basically passed around a hat. I think we had about half the budget when we started shooting".[12]
More than 800 children across Colombia were considered for the main roles of child soldiers. First, 20 to 30 were chosen to participate in a weeks-long camp in mountains, where they received acting training from Argentine actressInés Efronin the morning, and military training from Wilson Salazar, who plays the Messenger, in the afternoon, and the final eight were cast among them.[9][12][13]Salazar was aFARCsoldier from age 11 to 24, and Landes found him at one of the reinsertion programmes Landes visited for research. Landes first hired Salazar as a consultant before casting him as the Messenger.[14][15][16]The role of Rambo, played by Buenaventura, who goes by Matt, was originally written to be a boy, but Landes made the character's gender ambiguous during the casting process.[9][17][18]Monosmarked the first film appearances of the main actors aside from Arias and Nicholson. Quintero and Castrillón had acting experience in theatre. Buenaventura and Giraldo have continued acting in film sinceMonos.[9]
The production began in late 2016 and lasted nine weeks.[19]The mountain scenes were shot inChingaza National Natural Park, four hours outside ofBogotáand more than 4,000 m (13,000 ft) above sea level.[9][17][18][20]The jungle scenes were shot around theSamaná Norte RiverinAntioquia Department, five hours fromMedellín.[9][14][20]Because of the conflict, the jungle was considered too dangerous for civilians to visit until recently, hence remaining mostly untouched by humans. For the cast and crew, mules carried food and gear, Colombia's national kayak team helped them find a base camp, and a family of illegal gold miners built military tents.[9][14][21]Underwater scenes were shot with buoyancy equipment attached to the actors, with the kayak team helping ensure safety.[9][16][22]Prominent underwater cinematographer Peter Zuccarini  joined the crew for three to four days.[9][10][19]According to cinematographer Jasper Wolf, both locations had never been captured on film before.[20]
Monosis the fourth film scored byMica Levi, followingUnder the Skin,Jackie, andMarjorie Prime.[22]Levi came on board after seeing an unfinished cut.[9][17]Landes asked Levi for a "monumental, but minimal" score.[23]Levi first made short compositions involving whistles, made by Levi blowing into a glass bottle,timpani, and a synthesizer sound, around which further compositions were built.[23]Different sounds were assigned to represent various characters: a shrill bottle whistle became the "authority whistle", evoking the presence of the Organization; a bird-like whistle represented the bond among the child soldiers;[23][9]and timpani accompanied with the authority whistle represented "the shadowy force that tries to control the group from a distance".[9]The score is used sparingly throughout the film, taking up only 22 minutes.[23]
In January 2019,Neonacquired the US distribution rights to the film.[24]In March 2019Participant Mediajoined as a co-distributor for the US.[25]
The film holds a 92% approval rating onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, based on 150 reviews with an average rating of 8/10. The website's consensus states: "As visually splendid as it is thought-provoking,Monostakes an unsettling look at human nature whose grim sights leave a lingering impact."[26]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted averagescore of 78 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[27]

NEON Rated, LLC,doing business asNeon(stylized inall caps), is an Americanindependent filmproductionanddistributioncompany founded in 2017 by CEO Tom Quinn andTim League, who also was the co-founder of theAlamo Drafthouse Cinemachain.[1]As of 2019, League is no longer involved with daily operations for the company.[6]
Its first film,Colossal, was released in 2017.[7]The company became known for distributing such notable films asI, Tonya(2017),Parasite(2019),Portrait of a Lady on Fire(2019),Palm Springs(2020),Flee(2021),Spencer(2021),The Worst Person in the World(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023),Anora(2024),Longlegs(2024),The Seed of the Sacred Fig(2024), andThe Monkey(2025).[8][9]
Parasitewent on to become Neon's highest-grossing film at the worldwidebox officewith $262 million and the first non-English-language film to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture.[10]In 2024,Longlegshad a domestic box office gross of $58.6 million, becoming the distributor's highest-grossing film ever in North America.[11]Anorabecame the company's second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[12]Neon has also worked with several high-profile filmmakers, which includesSean Baker,[13]Bong Joon-ho,Julia Ducournau,Craig Gillespie,Pablo Larraín, andCéline Sciamma.[14]
During the 4th Annual Zurich Summit, Tom Quinn commented on Neon's intent to release titles that appeal to audiences who "skew under 45, that have no aversion to violence, no aversion to foreign language and to non-fiction".[15]Explaining the success of the company in 2024, Quinn said: "We were very much a startup, with everyone functioning as this sophisticated amoeba. We very quickly found ourselves that year inTorontowith a great slate [...] That work enabled us to sit at the table in Toronto that year and buyI, Tonya. Before the ink was even dry on the deal, we were planning its Oscar campaign. It's a testament to how quickly we can make decisions because we're not this big studio. We've always used that to our advantage."[16]
In September 2017, the company partnered withBlumhouse Productionsto manage BH Tilt.[17]In 2018, a majority stake of Neon was sold to30West, the media venture arm of "The Friedkin Group".[4][18]In February 2021,Bleecker Streetpartnered with Neon to launch the joint home entertainment distribution companyDecal, which is a standalone full-service operation that handlesdistribution dealson the home entertainment rights to both Neon and Bleecker Street's features. The first film to be distributed through Decal was the Bleecker Street releaseSupernovain winter 2021.[5]Additionally, Decal acquired North American distribution rights to the South Africanhorror filmGaiafor a summertheatrical release, marking their first ever acquisition.[19]
Andrew Brown (Co-President of Decal) oversaw the launch of Neon's home entertainment division. In 2022, Brown was promoted to "President of Digital Distribution". The exec, who has served as "SVP of Digital Strategy, Marketing, and Distribution" for Neon since 2017, also manages Neon's library, and oversees the annualFYC DVD Box Setanddirect-to-consumerdigital portal "Neon Cinema".[20]Prior to the joint-venture,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, as well asThe Criterion CollectionandWell Go USA Entertainment(for the filmPossessorwhich Neon and Well Go co-distributed), distributed several Neon films onhome video.[21][22][23]
In August 2023, Neon hired formerA24employees Alexandra Altschuler as "VP Media" and Don Wilcox as "VP Marketing".[24]That same month, Neon hired former Sierra/Affinity employee Kristen Figeroid as "President of International Sales and Distribution", Laurel Charnetsky as "VP International Acquisitions & Operations", and Dan Stadnicki as "Manager, International Sales & Distribution".[25]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, Neon was approved to continue promotional activities for its films since the company does not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP) nor had encountered any issue in receivingSAG-AFTRAinterim agreements.[26][27][28]
In May 2024, Neon hired Joey Monteiro as "EVP, International Marketing" and Ashley Hirsch as "Manager of International Sales and Marketing".[29]That same month, Neon promoted Elissa Federoff from "President of Distribution" to "Chief Distribution Officer" and Ryan Friscia from "EVP, Finance and Business Development" to "Chief Financial Officer".[30]Furthermore, Jeff Deutchman, who joined Neon when it was launched, serves as "President of Acquisitions and Production".[31]
Additionally, Neon has acquired the distribution rights to fivePalme d'Orwinners at theCannes Film Festival:Parasite(2019),Titane(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023), andAnora(2024); all five won consecutively.[31][32][33]The company's strategy to acquire such titles at Cannes is to eschew "the lazy approach", said Deutchman. "The only real way to do Cannes is to go see as many movies as you can, because you never know where the nextDogtoothorBorderorHungerorForce Majeureis going to come from", he added, citing several modern Cannes standouts championed by arthouse buyers.[31]After acquiringParasitein 2018, Neon financed and distributed the film the following year in U.S. territories.[34]"From the very beginning, Tom Quinn sawParasiteas a universal film and refused to put it in a box as a foreign-language or international film", saidParasitedirectorBong Joon-ho. "He saw the heart of the film and understood that it was about all of us living in our modern class-based society. I was always grateful for that."[16]Neon spent $20 million promoting, distributing, and campaigning for the film's awards.[3]The film subsequently became Neon's highest-grossing film with more than $200 million at the worldwidebox officeand won fourAcademy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Director. Similarly, Neon spent $18 million promotingAnora, three times the film's original budget.[3]Anoraultimately won the two aforementioned Academy Awards whileAnatomy of a FallandTriangle of Sadnesswere nominated for the same two categories, among others. As of 2025, Neon has garnered 39 Academy Award nominations, winning 11 overall.[10][12][35][36]
In 2023, Quinn commented on the company's success at Cannes, saying: "We've seen over the years that each of these films, because of their credibility and success, the Palme d'Or has come to mean something quite impactful for a very young group ofcinephiles. And the reason why we know this is we've tested all these movies and dating back toParasite, probably I think, the fifth reason why people came to see the film, in itstest screeninginSherman Oaks, was the fact that it won the Palme d'Or, and each subsequent year that went up. And this year, the number one reason why people came to see the film [Anatomy of a Fall], at a test screening inBurbank, was the fact that it had won the Palme d'Or."[37]In 2024, Quinn stated: "The award means a lot. To audiences here who are looking for the absolute most adventurous, forward-looking cinema available, that award represents it because these films have delivered, and they've been major Oscar contenders."[16]
In July 2024, Neon received its biggest opening weekend at the box office with the horror thriller filmLonglegs, after scoring $22.6 million from 2,510 theaters (a figure that includes $2.5–3 million in Thursday previews) and only behindUniversal/Illumination's second weekend ofDespicable Me 4. Initially projected to gross $7–9 million, the opening marked the biggest total for an original horror film of 2024, one of the top 20 weekends for an independent film and the best opening ever for an independent horror film.[38][39][40]To promote the film, Neon utilizedguerrilla marketingtactics similar to those that led to the box office success ofThe Blair Witch Project(1999).[41]DirectorOz Perkinscredited Neon for the film's marketing, stating the studio "really responded strongly to the movie, the raw materials of the movie really excited them, the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it sounds. They asked me early on, 'Do we have your permission to kind of go nuts?' And I said, 'What else are we doing here? Go for it. Do your thing.'"[42]The film's total marketing budget was under $10 million, focusing ondigital contentand not havingtelevision ads.[38]During its third weekend,Longlegsbecame the company's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office, earning $58.6 million, surpassing whatParasiteearned with $53.3 million in 2020.[11]Furthermore, it became the top grossing R-rated horror film of 2024 and the highest-grossing indie horror film of the last decade, topping A24'sTalk to Me(2022),Insidious: Chapter 3(2015) fromFocus Features, and A24'sHereditary(2018).[11]Afterward, furthering their marketing campaign, from August 1 to 4, Neon (partnering withAtom Tickets) offered free tickets to anyone who has a birthday that falls on the 14th of any given month. To get the tickets, those who registered and purchased tickets through Atom Tickets received a special promo code after verifying their date of birth and were able to get one free ticket per customer, while supplies lasted.[43]

Participant Media, LLCwas an American independentfilmand television production company founded in 2004 byJeffrey Skoll, dedicated to entertainment intended to spur social change.[1]The company financed and co-produced film and television content, as well asdigital entertainmentthrough its subsidiary SoulPancake, which the company acquired in 2016.[2]
The company was originally named Participant Productions and went on to become a well-known independent financier. The company's name descriptively politicizes[3]its basis on currentlytopicalsubjects presented to induce awareness of problematic social aspects.[4][5][6]
The company produced, financed, or co-produced 135 films and five television series. Its films have been nominated for 73 Academy Awards, and have won 18, including Best Picture forGreen BookandSpotlight.[7][8][9][10]
Participant, which earnedB Corpcertification in 2017,[11]was the largest company that exclusively produces and financessocial impact entertainment.[12]
On April16, 2024, Skoll announced that the company would be ceasing operations after two decades, with nearly all of its staff being dismissed and development of new content shutting down entirely.[13]
The company was founded in January 2004 asParticipant ProductionsbyJeffrey Skoll, the "second employee" ofeBay,[14][8]with $100 million in cash from his  personal funds.[4]Its goal was to produce projects that would be both commercially viable and socially relevant.[15]
Skoll was the company's first chief executive officer, but stepped down in August 2006.[4]The firm's initial plans were to produce four to six films per year, each with a budget of $40 million.[5][15]It focused on films in six areas –  the environment, health care, human rights, institutional responsibility, peace and tolerance, and social and economic justice.[4]It evaluated projects by running them past its creative executives first, only then assessing their cost and commercial viability, and  analyzing their social relevance last.[4][16]Once the decision was made to go ahead with production, the company askednon-profit organizationsto build campaigns around the release.[4][5]In some cases, the studio has spent years creating positive word-of-mouth with advocacy groups, which are often encouraged to use the film to push their own agendas.[17]
The new company quickly announced an ambitious slate of productions. Its first film was thedrama filmAmerican Gun(2005), withequity partnerIFC Films.[5][6]Two weeks later, the company announced aco-productiondeal withWarner Bros.on two films – thegeopoliticalthriller filmSyriana(2005) and the drama filmClass Action(later re-titledNorth Country)(2005).[6][18]Participant Productions contributed half the budget of each film.[6]Its fourth production, a documentary film, was announced in November 2004. TitledThe World According to Sesame Street(2005), the film examined the impact of the children's television showSesame Streeton world culture, focusing onKosovo,Bangladesh,South AfricaandEl Salvador.[19][20]At the same time, the company began to implement anenvironmentally friendlystrategy:Syrianawas the company's firstcarbon-neutralproduction, and the company createdcarbon offsetsfor the documentary filmAn Inconvenient Truth(2006).[21]
In 2005, the company suffered its first stumble. It again agreed to co-finance a picture with Warner Bros.,Vadim Perelman's second feature,Truce.[22]Although Perelman claimed he had "never been moved by a script to such an extent",[22]the film never went into production.[23]North Countrydid poorly at the box office despite recent Academy Award-winnerCharlize Theronin the lead.[7]The World According to Sesame Streetnever found a distributor for theatrical release, and eventually only aired onPBStelevision,Sesame Street's broadcast home.[7]
The company announced in March 2005 that it would executive produce the Warner Bros. drama filmGood Night, and Good Luck.[24]At theCannes Film Festivalin May, the company bought the right to distribute the forthcoming drama filmFast Food Nation(2006)  directed byRichard Linklaterin North America in return for an equity stake.[25][26]A month later, it bought distribution rights to the documentaryMurderballin return for an equity stake.[27]It also executive produced and co-financedAl Gore'sglobal-warmingdocumentary,An Inconvenient Truth.[20][28][29][30]
As heavier production scheduling grew, the company added staff. Ricky Strauss was named the first president in March 2005, with oversight ofproduction,marketingand business development.[31]Attorney and former non-profit chief executive Meredith Blake was hired in June as its Senior Vice President of Corporate and Community Affairs,[32]to oversee development of awareness and outreach campaigns around the social issues raised in the company's films in cooperation with non-profit organizations, corporations, andearned media.[32]Diane Weyermann, director of theSundance Institute's Documentary Film Program, joined the company in October 2005 as Executive Vice President of Documentary Production.[33]
The company's non-film-production efforts continued to grow. The company provided an undisclosed amount of financing in February 2005 to film distributorEmerging Picturesto finance that company's national network ofdigitally equipped cinemas(with Emerging Pictures distributing Participant's films).[34]The company also began its first socially relevant outreach project, helping to finance screenings of thebiographical filmGandhi(1982) in thePalestinian territoriesfor the first time as well as in the countries ofIsrael,Jordan,LebanonandSyria.[35]In support of its upcoming film,An Inconvenient Truth,the studio negotiated a deal for distributorParamount Classicsto donate five percent of its U.S. domestic theatrical gross box-office receipts (with a guarantee of $500,000) to theAlliance for Climate Protection.[36]
The company had a very successful 2005 awards season, with eleven Academy Award nominations and one win.[7]Good Night, and Good Luckgarnered six nominations, includingBest Art Direction,Best Cinematography,Best Director(George Clooney),Best Picture,Best Actor in a Leading Role(David Strathairn) andBest Original Screenplay.[37]Murderballwas nominated forBest Documentary Feature.[37]North Countrywas nominated forBest Actress in a Leading Role(Charlize Theron) andBest Actress in a Supporting Role(Frances McDormand).[37]Syrianawas nominated forBest Actor in a Supporting Role(George Clooney) andBest Original Screenplay.[37]But of the eleven nominations, onlyGeorge Clooneywon forBest Actor in a Supporting RoleinSyriana.[38]
In June, the company announced it would partner withNew Line Cinema(a subsidiary of Warner Bros.) to produceThe Crusaders, a drama aboutBrown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), a landmark ruling of theSupreme Court of the United Stateswhich endedracial segregationinpublic schools.[39]But the film never got beyond the development stage. In September, the company entered into an agreement to co-produce the drama filmThe Visitor(2008) withGroundswell Productions,[40]and two months later agreed to co-produce (withSony Pictures Classics) a documentary film aboutthe Abu Ghraib torture scandal,Standard Operating Procedure(2008), directed byErrol Morris.[41]
The company also took an equity position in and a co-production credit forChicago 10(2007), ananimated documentaryfilm about the 1969Chicago Sevenconspiracy trial.[42][43]
Finally, in December, the company agreed to finance and produce the documentary filmMan from Plains(2007), directed byJonathan Demme, that followed formerU.S. PresidentJimmy Carteras he promoted hispolitical-sciencebook,Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid(2006).[44]
The company also co-financed, withWarner Independent Pictures, the documentary filmDarfur Now(2007),[45]and, withUniversal Studiosand others, co-financed thebiographical filmCharlie Wilson's War(2007).[46]The film had the biggest budget of any of the company's films sinceSyriana.[7]
Three major corporate events also occurred in 2006.
The company's success continued through the 2006 awards season.An Inconvenient Truthwas nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Documentary Feature, and the song "I Need to Wake Up" (byMelissa Etheridge) nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Original Song.[51]The film and song won their respective categories in February 2007.[52][53]
Corporate growth continued in 2007. On January 8, the company hired motion-picture marketing veterans Buffy Shutt and Kathy Jones, both Executive Vice President of Marketing, to coordinate marketing of the company's films.[54]Eight days later, the company hiredTony Award- andEmmy Award-winning event producer John Schreiber as Executive Vice President of Social Action and Advocacy to enhance the company's earned media, non-profit and corporate outreach and advocacy campaigns.[55]
February saw the hire of Adrian Sexton as Executive Vice President to oversee digital and global media projects,[56]and April saw veteran production head Jonathan King join the company as Executive Vice President of Production.[57]Lynn Hirshfield was hired in May as Vice President of Business Development to launch the company's publishing division,[58]and saw Bonnie Abaunza and Liana Schwarz both Vice President of Social Action Campaign Development and Operations to assist with social outreach and advocacy campaigns in mid-June.[59]
In November, the company signed a deal with actressNatalie Portman's newly formed production company, Handsomecharlie Films, under which the two studios would co-produce socially relevant films for a two-year period. No films were produced under this agreement, however.[60]The same month, the company hired veteranShowtimeproducer John Moser to oversee development and production of original programs for television and home cable.[61]But despite the management activity and expansion, not all of the company's films did well.Chicago 10did not sell for several months after it premiered at Sundance, and only significant editing and a reduction in running time led to a distribution deal.[7]
The company also announced additional productions. In January, it said it was co-financing the drama filmThe Kite Runner(2007) withSidney Kimmel EntertainmentandDreamWorks Pictures, the latter company then owned byViacomviaParamount Pictures.[54]The Kite Runnerwas the first collaboration between both Participant and DreamWorks; the two companies would not collaborate again untilThe Helpin 2011. That spring, the company took an equity position inAngels in the Dust(2007), a documentary film about children orphaned byAIDS, and paid the filmmaker to update the film and shoot more footage.[7]
In April, it closed a deal with Warner Independent to turnRandy Shilts' biographical book,The Mayor of Castro Street(1982) into a film,[62]but the project entered development hell, as well as the feature-length documentary about the2007 Live Earthconcert later.[63]Five months later the company agreed   (withBroken Lizard) to co-produce and co-finance the company's first comedy film,Taildraggers, revolving around five pilots trying to stop oil extraction from an Alaskan preserve.[64]As of June 2009, however, the film had not been produced.[65]
Participant then signed a co-production deal with State Street Pictures to finance the biographical drama,Bobby Martinezaboutthe eponymous Latino surferin November.[66]The film entered development hell for nearly two years but hired Ric Roman Waugh to rewrite and direct in April 2009,[67]with supposed production by the beginning of 2012. By the end of 2007, the company was seen as a key player in documentary production.[68]
In March 2008, Participant Productions changed its name to Participant Media to reflect the firm's expansion into television and non-traditional entertainment media.[69]
The company continued to expand its social advocacy and outreach efforts in 2008. On January 16, 2008, it joined and made a financial contribution to a $100 millionUnited Nations-sponsored fund which would provide backing for films which combatted religious, ethnic, racial, and other stereotypes.[70]Fueling the company's expansion was the creation of a $250 million fund with Image Nation, a start-up film studio based in theUnited Arab Emirateswhich is a division of theAbu Dhabi Media Company.[71]Each company contributed roughly half of the fund's total (although some funding came from loans).[71]Participant and Image Nation agreed to produce 18 films over the next five years, which would add approximately four feature-length films per year to Participant's existing slate.[71][72]To boost its marketing efforts, the company also hired Jeffrey Sakson as Vice President of Publicity in April 2008.[73]In September 2008, Participant Media andPublicAffairs Bookssigned a deal under which PublicAffairs would publish four original paperback books designed to expand upon the social messages in Participant's films.[74]The first book to be published under the pact wasFood Inc.: A Participant Guide: How Industrial Food Is Making Us Sicker, Fatter, and Poorer—And What You Can Do About It.[74]The company also founded a new Web site,TakePart.com, to promote Participant Media's films as well as make viewers aware of the social advocacy efforts of Participant's outreach partners.[75]In 2009, the company signed a first look deal with Summit Entertainment.[76]
In March, Participant announced a co-financing deal with Tapestry Films to produceMinimum Wage, a comedy about a corrupt corporate executive sentenced to live for a year on aminimum wagesalary.[69]It was not produced. A month later, the company announced it and Groundswell Productions were co-financingThe Informant!, a comedy directed bySteven Soderberghand starringMatt Damonabout thelysine price-fixing conspiracyatArcher Daniels Midlandin the mid-1990s.[77][78]July saw Participant set up a co-financing deal with three other studios to produceThe Colony, an eco-horror film.[79]It, too, was never produced.
The 2007 awards season saw several more Academy Award nominations for the company's films. Its films had a combined sevenGolden Globe Awardnominations, although it won none.[80]Philip Seymour Hoffmanwas nominated for hissupporting actor roleinCharlie Wilson's War,Richard Jenkinswas nominated for Best Actor inThe Visitor, andAlberto Iglesiaswas nominated forbest original scoreforThe Kite Runner.[81]But the studio won no Oscars that year.[clarification needed]The success during awards season did not extend into 2008. The company had only three films released during the year (Every Little Step,Pressure Cooker, andStandard Operating Procedure), and none of them was nominated for an award from a major arts organization. However, on November 19, 2008, the Producers Guild of America gave Participant founder Jeff Skoll its Visionary Award.[82]
In 2009, it saw the company continue to aggressively produce both feature films and documentaries. In January, it announced that it would producePaul Dinello'sMr. Burnout(about aburned outteacher seeking to rekindle his love of teaching)[83]andFurry Vengeance(a comedy starringBrendan Fraserabout anOregonreal estate developer who is opposed by animals).[78][84]But onlyFurry Vengeancewas produced. That same month Participant signed a five-year production and distribution deal with Summit Entertainment. The agreement, which covered titles financed by Participant's $250 million production agreement with Imagination Media, was nonexclusive (meaning Participant could seek distribution of films by other companies) and was limited to four projects a year.[50]The agreement allowed Summit to charge a distribution fee, and to co-finance titles if it wished.[50]The pact covered home video and pay-television distribution as well.[50]Furry Vengeancewas the first picture produced under the agreement.[84]In April, the company hired screenwriter Miles Chapman to pen an untitled environmentally themed action-adventure script about the hunt for a mystical gem in the heart of Africa.[85]The script went into development hell. The same month, the company agreed to co-finance (with Krasnoff/Foster Entertainment) a biographical drama titledHistory on Trial—which was intended to document the true story ofDeborah Lipstadt, a professor ofJewish studieswho was sued byHolocaust deniersDavid Irvingforlibel.[86][87]The film was not produced, but the company did go on to makeDenial, starring Rachel Weisz, about the same subject in 2016. The company also announced a number of productions in May 2009, including:The Crazies, a remake of the1973 film of the same name;[88]Casino Jack and the United States of Money,a film about theJack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal;[89]Help Me Spread Goodness, a comedy starring and directed byBen Stillerabout a banking executive who is caught by aNigerian Internet scam(the film was not produced);[90][91]andThe Soloist, a drama starringJamie FoxxandRobert Downey, Jr.based on the true story ofNathaniel Ayers, a brilliant musician who developsschizophreniaand becomeshomeless.[78]
The company also expanded in non-film production as well. In March, Participant agreed to conduct outreach and social advocacy efforts on behalf of theLionsgate/Roadside AttractionsdocumentaryThe Coveabout dolphin slaughters by Japanese villagers in a cove near fishing grounds.[92]The firm's TakePart website also released a newiPhoneapplication, Givabit, which solicits charitable donations for Participant Media's nonprofit advocacy partners from iPhone users once a day.[75]In June, the company established a new book publishing subsidiary, headed by Vice President of Publishing Lynn Hirshfield (who changed titles within the company).[74][93]Liana Schwarz was promoted to Senior Vice President of Campaign Development and Operations.[94]
On January 28, 2010, Participant Media co-presented director Mark Lewis' documentary,Cane Toads: The Conquestat the Sundance Film Festival.[95]The film, according toDaily Varietysaid, was the "first specialty doc filmed in digital 3D."[95]A month later, Bonnie Stylides left Summit Entertainment to become Participant's Senior Vice-President of Business Affairs.[96]The studio's hit documentary,Waiting for "Superman", garnered media acclaim, and Participant inked a worldwide distribution deal withParamountshortly before its premiere at Sundance.[97]It also sold North American distribution rights for its documentary,Countdown to Zero, toMagnolia Pictures,[98]and distribution rights to its documentaryClimate of Changeto Tribeca Film (a division ofRobert De Niro's Tribeca Enterprises).[99]
The company also received a $248,000 grant from theRobert Wood Johnson Foundationto raise awareness about access to quality food and childhood obesity.[100]The studio used these funds to create a campaign linked to its promotional efforts for the documentary filmFood, Inc.and signed a deal with Active Media to help run the campaign.[100]It    signed a deal with Planet Illogica (a website collaboratively produced by artists, filmmakers, musicians, and fashion designers) to generate a social action campaign associated with its documentaryOceans(which was released byWalt Disney Pictures).[101]The "Save My Oceans Tour" involved concerts, art installations, and screenings ofOceanson college campuses.[102]
On April 13, Noah Manduke (former president of the consulting firm Durable Good and president of the marketing firmSiegel + Gale) was named chief strategy officer of the Jeff Skoll Group.[103]Skoll created the Skoll Group to oversee his various enterprises, including Participant Media, and Manduke began working with Skoll and Participant Media's top management to begin a strategic planning process and strengthen collaboration between Participant and Skoll's other organizations and companies.[103]The following month, studio executive James Berk was one of only 180 individuals invited to join theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[104]
Based on the success of itsTwilight Sagafilm series, Summit Entertainment announced on March 8, 2011, that it was making a $750 million debt refinancing with cash distribution to its investors, which included Participant Media.[105]
On June 5,The New York Timesran a major story about the studio, declaring: "Participant Media, the film industry's most visible attempt at social entrepreneurship, turned seven this year without quite sorting out whether a company that trades in movies with a message can earn its way in a business that has been tough even for those who peddle 3-D pandas and such."[106]AuthorMichael Cieplynoted thatThe Beaver, Participant's latest released, cost $20 million but had garnered just $1 million in gross box-office sales after a month in theaters –  making the film a "flop".[106]The company's biggest success to date, the newspaper noted, was 2007'sCharlie Wilson's War($66.7 million in gross domestic box office revenue).[106]Skoll was quoted as saying that he had poured "hundreds of millions to date [into the company], with much more to follow", and that the studio had yet to break even.[106]Skoll and Berk, however, noted that Participant Media performs slightly above-average when compared to similarly-sized peers.[106]The advantage came in three areas: home video sales, the company's long-term attempts to build social movements around its films, and its stake in Summit Entertainment (which allowed it to win more favorable distribution terms).[106]
TheTimessaid that audiences may be turned off by Participant's relentless focus on upsetting issues, quoting unnamed sources.[106]The company hoped that it would change this attitude about its films (and make money) with 2011'sThe Help(about racial reconciliation in the American South during the 1960s) andContagion(aSteven Soderberghpicture about the outbreak of a virulent, deadly disease).[106]Skoll also said that Participant had purchased the rights to aNew York Timesarticle about theDeepwater Horizonoil spillof 2010, and that the film would likely focus not simply on oil drilling, but on a number of critical issues, such as climate change and the ecological health of oceans.[106]
By year's end, however, there was less concern about the company's financial future. The studio's $25 million film about racial reconciliation (about a third of the production budget came from Participant),[107]The Help, cleared $100 million in late August,[108]and was just short of $200 million worldwide by late December.[109]The Helpwas the first film since 2010'sInceptionto be number one at the North American box office for three straight weekends in a row,[110]and was only unseated by another Participant Media film,Contagion.[111]The Helpwas nominated for fourAcademy Awards: The film for Best Picture,Viola Davisfor Best Actress, andJessica ChastainandOctavia Spencerfor Best Supporting Actress. Spencer won the Oscar for her role.[112]
Participant executives said on October 14, 2011 that the studio would expand its production to make seven to twelve films per year, would begin producing features and series for television, and would expand its online presence.[113]As part of this plan, in November the studio hired advertising executive Chad Boettcher to be executive vice president for social action and advocacy and20th Century Foxexecutive Gary Frenkel to be senior vice president for digital products and communities.[114]
In January 2012, Participant Media made its first investment in a non-English-language film, the forthcomingPablo Larraínmotion pictureNo(starringGael Garcia Bernal).[115]The semi-biographical film tells the story of a man who initiates an upbeat, innocuous advertising campaign that helps to unseatChileandictator GeneralAugusto Pinochetduring the 1988plebiscitethat led to theChilean transition to democracy. The same month, however, it lost its president, Ricky Strauss, who departed the studio to become head of worldwide marketing at Walt Disney Pictures.[116]
Three weeks later, on February 2, 2012, Participant Media announced that it was partnering with Summit Entertainment,Image Nation, Spanish production company Apaches Entertainment, and Colombian production company Dynamo to produce a supernatural horror film about an American oil company executive who moves his family into a house in a small city inColombia, only to find the home is haunted.

Pete Saunders, a survivor who was appointed to the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors and who arranged the February 4th screening, was asked to take a leave of absence shortly thereafter. Shortly after winning multiple Oscars, including Best Picture, the Vatican's newspaper praisedSpotlightfor exposing these abuses.[129][130][131]The film, however, did face controversy including some criticism from an author ofThe New York Timescalling it, "a misrepresentation of how the Church dealt with sexual abuse cases", arguing that the movie's biggest flaw was its failure to portray psychologists who had assured Church officials that abusive priests could be safely returned to ministry after undergoing therapy treatments.[132]Another criticism was that the film falsely portrayed Jack Dunn, the public relations head and a member of the board atBoston College High School, as a member of the Boston Archdiocesan cover-up (for which the dialogue itself was mythologised).[133][134]
On February 28, 2016, the company won its first Best Picture Academy Award forSpotlight. The acclaimed drama also picked up the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer).
