The sequel wasgreenlightedduring the opening weekend ofGodzilla, withGareth Edwardsexpected to return to direct a trilogy. In May 2016, Edwards left the project. In October 2016, Dougherty and Shields were hired to rewrite the script. In January 2017, Dougherty was announced as the director.Principal photographybegan in June 2017 inAtlanta, Georgia, andwrappedin September 2017.

Godzilla: King of the Monsterswas theatrically released on May 31, 2019, to mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its visual effects, action sequences, cinematography, and musical score but with criticism to the plot, pacing, tone and characters.[21][22]The film was abox-office failure,[9][23][24]grossing $387.3 million worldwide against a production budget between $170–200 million and marketing costs between $100–150 million,[12][13]marking it the lowest-grossing film in the Monsterverse.[25]
A sequel,Godzilla vs. Kong, was released on March 24, 2021.
Five years after the revelation of giant monsters, called "Titans", to the world,[f]Dr. Emma Russell, apaleobiologistworking for the Titan-studying organization Monarch, and her daughter Madison witness the birth of alarvacalledMothra. Emma calms Mothra with the "Orca," a device that emits frequencies to attract or alter Titan behavior. A group ofeco-terrorists, led by formerBritish ArmyColonel Alan Jonah, attacks the base and abducts Emma and Madison. At the same time, Mothra flees andpupatesunder a nearby waterfall.
Monarch scientists Dr. Ishirō Serizawa and Vivienne Graham approach former employee Dr. Mark Russell, Emma's ex-husband and Madison's father, to help track them down. Mark is initially reluctant due to his hatred towardGodzilla, whom he blames for his son Andrew's death inSan Francisco, but eventually agrees. The Monarch team follows Godzilla toAntarctica, where Jonah plans to free a three-headed Titan codenamed "Monster Zero". Emma frees and awakens Monster Zero, who proves to be hostile; he slaughters Monarch's G-Team, battles Godzilla, and devours Graham before escaping. The team later realizes that Emma is working with the terrorists. From a Monarch bunker, Emma contacts Monarch, arguing that the Titans must be awakened to heal the Earth from thehuman impact on the environment, pointing to Monarch research indicating that Titans can terraform and replenish ecosystems.
Conflicted, Madison begs her mother to reconsider, but Emma awakensRodaninMexico, and the Monarch team lures it toward Monster Zero. After Monster Zero defeats Rodan, Godzilla ambushes Monster Zero, severing his left head. During the fight, the U.S. military launches a prototype weapon called the "Oxygen Destroyer", seemingly killing Godzilla. However, Monster Zero is unaffected and regrows his lost head before awakening the other dormant Titans worldwide. Rodan submits to his rule; Serizawa chides Mark that he's gotten his wish. Horrified and disillusioned, Madison disowns Emma.
Through analyzing Monster Zero's abilities and mythological texts, Monarch deduces that it'sKing Ghidorah, a highly destructivealienand that it likely seeks to terraform Earth for itself destructively. A fully transformed Mothra flies to Monarch'sBermudabase to communicate with Godzilla, who is recuperating in an ancient underwater city in theHollow Earth. The team uses a submarine to locate Godzilla's highlyradioactivelair. Deducing it will take too long for Godzilla to heal on his own, Serizawa sacrifices himself by manually detonating anuclear warheadto speed up the process, reviving Godzilla and increasing his power.
Emma realizes that Ghidorah's reign over the other Titans is bringing destruction far worse than anything humans could inflict, but Jonah ignores her pleas to try and stop it. Madison overhears her mother's plan to lure Ghidorah toBostonand steals the Orca to implement it herself. Arriving atFenway Park, Madison broadcasts a frequency that calms the Titans but unwittingly attracts them all to her location. Ghidorah lands in Boston to destroy the Orca. Godzilla arrives to engage him in battle with Monarch personnel's assistance. Mark leads a team to rescue Madison and escape the city, learning Godzilla's radiation levels are increasing and will lead to athermonuclear explosion. Mothra arrives to help Godzilla but is intercepted by Rodan; she defeats him but is injured in the process.
Ghidorah overpowers Godzilla, but Mothra sacrifices herself and transfers her energy to Godzilla. The Russells are reunited and reactivate the Orca to prevent Ghidorah from extracting Godzilla and Mothra's energy out of Godzilla. Emma stays behind to distract Ghidorah and to give her family and the Monarch team time to escape. Godzilla enters a newly empowered state and vaporizes Ghidorah and Emma. Rodan and the other Titans converge on Godzilla andbow to himas their newalpha.
During theending credits, news clippings and Monarch public files show that the Titans are now healing the planet, a suspected second Mothra egg has been discovered, and some Titans are converging onSkull Island. Ancient cave paintings depict Godzilla andKong-like Titans locked in battle[g]. In apost-credits scene, Jonah and his forces purchase Ghidorah's decapitated left head in Mexico.

Gareth Edwards, the director ofGodzilla(2014), stated that he wantedGodzillato work as a standalone film with a definitive ending, and he opposed suggestions that the ending should leave the film open for a sequel. He said that he had no problem coming back for a sequel if the film did well, but his main concern was delivering a satisfying experience with the current film, "I want a story that begins and ends, and you leave on a high note. That's all we cared about when we were making this; just this film. If this film is good, the others can come, but let's just pay attention to this and not get sidetracked by other things."[45]After a successful opening of $103 million internationally, Legendary greenlighted theGodzillasequel,[46]with plans to produce a trilogy and Edwards attached to direct.[47]AtSan Diego Comic-Conin July 2014, Legendary confirmed that they had acquired the rights to Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah fromToho Co., Ltd. A shortteaserclip showing concept art of all three with the ending tagline "Let them fight" was shown. Other details of their appearances in the sequels were not announced.[48]In August 2014, Legendary announced that the sequel would be released on June 8, 2018,[49]and thatGodzillawriterMax Borensteinwould return to write the screenplay.[50]
In April 2015,Aaron Taylor-Johnsonstated that he was unsure if he would reprise his role for the sequel and that his return depended on Edwards' decision.[51]In October 2015, Legendary announced plans to unite Godzilla and Kong in a film titledGodzilla vs. Kong, then-set for a 2020 release date. Legendary is creating a shared cinematic franchise "centered around Monarch" that "brings together Godzilla and ... King Kong in an ecosystem of other giant super-species, both classic and new." While Legendary will maintain its home at Universal Pictures, it will continue to collaborate with Warner Bros. for the franchise.[52]In May 2016,Warner Bros.announced thatGodzilla 2had been pushed back from its original June 8, 2018 release date to March 22, 2019, and shortly afterward, that Edwards had left the sequel to work on smaller-scale projects.[53][54]Edwards also felt that Legendary "needed to get on with things" instead of waiting for him to finish work onRogue One, but expressed his hope to work onGodzillaagain one day.[55]
In October 2016, it was announced that Michael Dougherty and Zach Shields (both of whom had worked onKrampus) would write the screenplay forGodzilla 2.[56]A day later, it was reported that Dougherty was also in negotiations to directGodzilla 2.[57]That same month, Legendary announced that production would also take place at parent company Wanda'sQingdao Movie Metropolisfacility inQingdao, China, along withPacific Rim: Uprising.[58]In December 2016, Legendary announced that the official title forGodzilla 2would beGodzilla: King of the Monsters.[59]In January 2017, Dougherty was officially confirmed as the director.[60]Dougherty stated that he was offered to direct first before being offered to re-write the script.[61]When asked about his reaction to being asked to direct, Dougherty stated, "'Yes.' That was my reaction very, very quickly. I felt flattered, honored...and that continues to this day. It was a dream come true. And lots of pressure. Immense, immense pressure."[62]Dougherty described the film as:
"The world is reacting to Godzilla in the same way we would react to any other terrifying incident, in that we are overreacting, but there's paranoia and endless speculation about whether he is the only one out there or whether we're threatened by others like his kind."[27]
While Dougherty loved the 2014 film's slow-build, he said that he would "take the gloves off for this film. No holding back."[63]While comparingKing of the Monstersto the 2014 film, Dougherty said "I would call (my movie) theAliensto Gareth'sAlien". Dougherty elaborated by noting the balance between serious and "fun, tongue-in-cheek moments" fromAliensand thatKing of the Monsterswould take a similar approach.[64]
In September 2014, it was reported that Max Borenstein would return to write the script.[50]While promotingKong: Skull Island, Borenstein mentioned that one thing he aimed to do in theGodzillasequel is make Godzilla more empathetic for the audience:
"When [Godzilla] blows his blue flame down the throat of the other creature—a creature we never empathized with in any way—we're empathizing with Godzilla. That's the thing about the movie that I'm most proud of, and I think Gareth did an amazing job pulling that off. I think that's what sets up our Godzilla franchise in a way that the second Godzilla movie can pick up on to begin to make Godzilla a more relatable, emphatic figure. But it needed that groundwork because you don't immediately invest emotionally in something that looks like a giant dragon or lizard."[65]
Legendary's only mandate was to include Monarch, Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah. For Dougherty's script, he and his team "started over from scratch". Dougherty began with a rough two-pagetreatmentthat contained basic beats and rough sketches of the characters. Subsequently, a writer's room was assembled that was run by Dougherty and co-writer/executive producer Zach Shields, with Borenstein participating. Ten writers contributed to building on the treatment.[66]The script took a year to come together. Dougherty also changed, revised, and improved lines during filming and post-production.[61]He felt the struggles of writing the script were balancing the monster spectacle "while still creating a story with human characters that we care about."[62]While the previous film focused on Ford with Monarch in the background, Dougherty wanted the film to be focused on Monarch, feeling there was an opportunity to craft the organization as a group of heroes. Due to this, the film became an ensemble piece.[64]
Dougherty and Shields chose a human story line where the science fiction elements could be replaced with themes such as climate change or eco-terrorism and stand out on its own without the monsters.[67]Dougherty felt that the third act proved the most challenging in terms of writing as many of the human and monster story arcs converged and needed to be resolved. Shields confirmed that Emma's speech to Monarch went through several rewrites. Shields and Dougherty wanted the speech to present a moral question to audiences whether they would put their faith in humanity or Mother Nature.[68]
In the original script, Mark and Sam were originally written as old friends. This was changed in later drafts from Sam to Serizawa to have him be the guiding force for Mark.[69]Dougherty added the Oxygen Destroyer as a representation of "humanity's inability to not interfere."[70]Dougherty and Shields chose to have Godzilla killed during the film's mid-point due to this being an idea that has not been done in previousGodzillafilms. Shields noted that this was also to parallel Godzilla and Mark's characters, stating, "Kyle's loss of faith in the beginning, and finding it in this moment when he realizes, you know, God is dead."[71]In Dougherty and Shields's treatment and early drafts, full sequences of the non-Toho Titans rising after Ghidorah's call were written but later trimmed due to budgetary concerns.[72]Borenstein had originally writtenMechagodzillainto the film. However, Dougherty scrapped the character during development.[73]
"So the concept we're running with is that this world belonged to them. If anything, we're the invasive species, and we've simply rediscovered something that's always been there and that they are in some ways, the old gods. The first gods. And that's something we're also trying to bring to this film for a more mythological, almost biblical, backdrop to the creatures."
The film reclassifies the monsters' designation from "MUTOs" to "Titans".[75]For the monsters, Dougherty wanted their designs to emit a godly presence and evoke a sense of worship, stating, "Primitive man saw these creatures, and you want to give them a presence that would make him drop to his knees and bow to this god...It can't just look like big dinosaurs.Jurassic Parkhas that covered. These have to be distinct. They have to be their own thing. They're Titans."[64]The director instructed the designers to look at the original designs from every era and "distill those silhouettes and those key traits into something more modern." It was important for the director that the Titans were not just treated as monsters but "very large animals with a distinct thought process."[61]
ForGodzilla, Dougherty wished to put back the "God in Godzilla".[29]He liked the design that Gareth Edwards and Matt Allsopp conceived but wanted to tweak it by adding the dorsal plates of the1954 iteration, as well as making the claws and feet bigger to make Godzilla look like a more powerful predator. The director had the sound design team expand on Godzilla's roar by making it sound closer to the roars of the 1954 incarnation, stating, "I think they did a great job with Godzilla's roar in the first movie. I pushed them a little bit further to bring it even closer to the (1954) original even more."[64]
ForRodan, elements ofvolcanic rockwere added to the scales and skin color to make Rodan look capable of living inside of a volcano. Dougherty wanted Rodan's design to resemble something that "Mother Nature could have created."[62]The designers were instructed to not just look atPteranodonsbut at various birds such as vultures, eagles, and hawks due to birds being related to dinosaurs.[61]Dougherty described Rodan as a "bit of a rogue...you never quite know where his loyalties lie". The director further described Rodan as a "massive A-bomb" that brings "speed and ferocity."[76]Tom Woodruff Jr.andAmalgamated Dynamicsprovided the creature design for Rodan.[61]The Rodan pursuit scene was the first pre-viz sequence produced to be used as a pitch to Legendary.[77]
ForMothra, Dougherty wanted to create something that was "beautiful, and feminine, and elegant, and looked like a true goddess, but also dangerous if she had to be." He attempted to remain faithful to the color palette of the original1961 incarnationand retain theeye-spotson her wings. The eye-spots were designed to resemble Godzilla's eyes in order to create a connection between Mothra and Godzilla. Mothra was designed to resemble realmothsand given longer legs in order to defend herself against other monsters, another attribute inspired by moths.[62]Dougherty researched various moth species and discovered that some looked "scary" and "predatory". He wished to maintain a sense of realism for Mothra, stating, "...the approach for Mothra is to create an insectoid, huge creature that looks believable from every angle, and especially in motion."[64]The director found Mothra the most difficult Titan to design because he wished to avoid making Mothra look like a blown-up moth.Legacy Effectsprovided the creature design for Mothra.[61]
ForKing Ghidorah, Dougherty wanted to create a "unique" design that still resembled King Ghidorah, and worked closely with Toho to make sure the new design respected past incarnations. Each head was given its own personality, with the center being the alpha and the others its lackeys. He studied various animals, specificallyking cobras, in order to add a sense of realism to the design.[62]The designers were instructed to look at different scales from various reptiles to avoid having Ghidorah's scales looking similar to Godzilla or the original King Ghidorah.[61]The director told the design team to maintain an Eastern dragon influence for Ghidorah and to avoid any Western dragon influence, stating, "They're not traditional western dragons. So those were marching orders from the beginning...We don't want it to look likeGame of Thrones'dragons."[64]Legacy Effects also provided the design for Ghidorah. While noting that the film is not a comedy, Dougherty likened Ghidorah toRip Van Winkle, having a sense of curiosity and cruelty.[61]Producer Alex Garcia described Ghidorah as "not part of the natural order."[78]
Dougherty confirmed that the film would feature original, non-Toho monsters.[79]The names of the non-Toho Titans were revealed as Baphomet, Typhon, Abaddon, Bunyip, Methuselah, Behemoth, Scylla, Tiamat, Leviathan, Sargon, and Mokele-Mbembe.[29][80]Dougherty created new monsters because he felt it was part of the "Toho tradition" to add new monsters to the Godzilla pantheon.[81]Dougherty had originally hoped for Legendary to acquire other Toho monsters such asAnguirus,Biollante, andGigan. However, the film's budget prevented them from acquiring additional Toho characters.[82]
For the roars, the director felt it was important "getting the noises right." He gave the sound designers a "super cut" of the monster roars from the ShōwaGodzillafilms, and had them start from there. He stated that the monsters would have new roars that would resemble the original incarnations.[64]Dougherty had the Shōwa roars on a massive speaker system to use on-set for scenes where actors had to run from or react to the monsters.[74]
In late January 2017, Millie Bobby Brown was the first to be cast for the film, in her feature film debut.[83]In February 2017, Kyle Chandler[84]and Vera Farmiga[85]were cast as the parents to Brown's character. In March 2017, it was reported that O'Shea Jackson Jr. was in talks for a role in the film.[86]In April 2017, Aisha Hinds was confirmed to join the cast of the film.[87]In May 2017, Anthony Ramos,[88]Randy Havens,[89]Thomas Middleditch,[90]and Charles Dance were added to the cast, and Sally Hawkins was confirmed to return.[91]A press release confirmed Watanabe's return for the sequel.[43]In June 2017, Bradley Whitford[92]and Zhang Ziyi were added to the cast, with the latter playing a "major role" in theMonsterverse.[93]In July 2017, Elizabeth Ludlow was added to the cast.[94]In April 2018, Jason Liles, Alan Maxson, and Richard Dorton were cast to provide themotion capturefor the heads of King Ghidorah, with Dorton performing the left head, Liles performing the middle head, and Maxson performing the right head. Other actors perform the body.[95][96]Liles also provided the performance capture forRodan.[41]
Matthew E. Cunningham was hired as a Senior Illustrator during the research and development stage. Cunningham designed most of the vehicles after the storyboard artist worked with Dougherty. Senior conceptual designer George Hull provided a series of concept paintings of vehicles and monster imagery. Production designer Scott Chambliss managed all the art directors. Artists would sometimes show concept art to the writers, producers, and director; however, Chambliss had final say on what would be shown to Dougherty and the producers. After the illustrations were approved, they were delivered for pre-vis. The visual effects used concept art and pre-viz as a reference. Legacy Effects, who had worked on Edwards'Godzilla, were brought back to provide additional concept art.[97]
Principal photography began on June 19, 2017, in Atlanta, Georgia under theworking titleFathom.[7][98]Dougherty confirmed that the film would feature practical effects and creature designs by Tom Woodruff Jr.[89]Lawrence Sherserved asdirector of photography.[43]Parts of the film were shot in theHistoric Center of Mexico Citybetween August 19–22, 2017.[8]Dougherty announced the film had wrapped production on September 27, 2017.[99]
Visual effects for the film were provided byMoving Picture Company(MPC),DNEG,Method Studios, Raynault VFX,Rodeo FXand Ollin VFX.Guillaume Rocheronwas the main visual effects supervisor.[100]In November 2018, post-production on the film officially ended.[101]The brief shots of the non-Toho Titans were "late additions" during post-production.[102]Dougherty said that an earlier cut of the film was nearly three hours long.[103]Dougherty affectionately referred to the three-hour cut asGodzilla: The Miniseries. He considered splitting the film into two parts but decided against it, feeling that the final cut is faithful to the core of his original vision.[104]
On July 21, 2018, Dougherty revealed thatBear McCrearywould compose the film's score, incorporating themes fromAkira Ifukube's previousGodzillascores.[30]Regarding his involvement, McCreary stated, "I am thrilled to be the composer forGodzilla: King of the Monsters, and honored beyond words to have the opportunity to contribute to one of cinema's longest-running musical legacies."[105]McCreary further expanded on his plans and involvement, stating;
"I've known Michael Dougherty for a long time, as we both run in the same film-nerd circles. I have always appreciated his love of film music, chatting with him for hours on end over the years about the scores we both love. I was thrilled for him when he landed the gig to directGodzilla, because I knew what it meant to him. When he later asked me to join the project, I was overwhelmed with excitement, and awe, grateful for the chance to join him in contributing to the legacy of our favorite monster. We knew from the beginning that we wanted to incorporate classic [Akira] Ifukube themes, and yet I think fans will be excited to hear how they have evolved. There are some fun surprises in store. Fitting the material and Michael's visionary film, this score is the most massive I have ever written, and I can't wait for fans to experience it!"[106]
The first trailer featured a rearrangement ofClaude Debussy'sClair de Luneby Michael Afanasyev for Imagine Music.[107]TheBeautifulTV spot and final trailer featured two different renditions of "Over the Rainbow".[108][109]An alternate mix ofNessun dormawas featured in the extendedIMAXpreview.[110]LL Cool J's "Mama Said Knock You Out" was featured in the Exclusive Final Look trailer.[111]In November 2018, a sample of McCreary's Godzilla theme was leaked online after it was used during a panel at Tokyo Comic Con.[112]In April 2019,WaterTower Musicreleased two tracks from the soundtrack, "Old Rivals", composed by McCreary, and a cover ofBlue Öyster Cult's "Godzilla" bySerj Tankian.Brendon Small,Gene Hoglan, and other members ofDethklokcontributed to the Tankian cover.
McCreary called the cover "the most audacious piece of music" he had produced in his career, citing the orchestra, choir, taiko chanting,taiko drumming, heavy metal rhythm section, Hoglan's double-kick drums, and Tankian's vocals used to produce the track. McCreary stated "For [the character] Godzilla, I chose to incorporate and adapt the legendary Akira Ifukube'siconic theme, and for Mothra,Yūji Koseki's immortal 'Mothra's Song'."[113]
The Japanese bandAlexandroscontributed the single "Pray" for the film'sJapaneserelease. On this decision, Dougherty commented, "we feel incredibly fortunate to have had [Alexandros] contribute such an anthemic song that captures not only the gravitas of the film, but also perfectly complements its dramatic conclusion."[114]The single was released on May 13, 2019.[115]The soundtrack was released byWaxwork Recordsin 2019 on a triple LP.[116]

Worldwide, the film was initially projected to earn around $180 million from 75 other territories in its opening weekend, for a global total of $230–235 million.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 42% of 353 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus reads: "Godzilla: King of the Monstersdelivers spectacular kaiju action -- and reaffirms that cutting-edge effects are still no substitute for a good story."[186]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[187]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, the same grade earned by the first two Monsterverse installments, while those atPostTrakgave it an overall positive score of 85% (with an average 4.5 out of 5 stars) and a 75% "definite recommend".[11]
Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiangave the film 2 out of 5 stars, writing that it "has rare moments of visual splendour but they can't disguise a laughable script with a ramshackle narrative."[188]Chris Evangelista of/Filmgave the film a score of 6.5 out of 10, criticizing the human characters and writing that "The ultimate kaiju smack-down shouldn't be this boring."[189]Kate Erbland ofIndieWiregave the film a grade of "C−", calling it "dark, wet, and inept,"[190]while Mike Ryan ofUproxxalso gave the film a negative review, writing that "When a movie is just nonstop monster action, guess what happens? It all becomes the new 'normal' and it becomes boring."[191]Ben Travis, writing forEmpire Online, gave the film 1 out of 5 stars, stating, "Globe-trotting but not adventurous, action-packed but not remotely exciting, utterly overstuffed and completely paper-thin."[192]
Owen GleibermanofVarietywrote that the film "makes for a spectacular clash of the titans, but this one has a less commanding balance of schlock and awe," compared to its predecessor.[2]Conversely,Alonso Duraldeof theTheWrappraised the film for taking an "all-thriller-no-filler approach both to monsters and the human drama."[193]Scott Collura ofIGN.com gave the film a score of 7.8 out of 10, calling it "a fun exercise in giant monster madness that indulges in all the kaiju fights fans and even casual viewers could hope for."[194]ForBloody Disgusting, William Bibbiani wrote "Godzilla: King of the Monstersis a big, kinda silly, but otherwise exciting blockbuster. It's gorgeous, it's epic in the extreme, and it features some of the most impressive monster fights you've ever seen. Maybe someday Americans will make a Godzilla movie that isn't just 'badass,' but which also works on another level and resonates in a meaningful way."[195]James Whitbrook ofIo9said the film "is little more than beautifully stunning sound and fury, sadly signifying nothing for its human stars—beyond them being a vector in which the movie can thickly spread on someb-moviecheese that lends the whole endeavor a sort of 'classic monster movie with a modern budget' vibe."[196]
In September 2015, Legendary'sKong: Skull Islandwas moved from Universal to Warner Bros., which sparked media speculation that Godzilla andKing Kongwould appear in a film together.[212][213]In October 2015, Legendary confirmed that they would unite Godzilla and King Kong inGodzilla vs. Kong. They planned to create a shared cinematic franchise "centered around Monarch" that "brings together Godzilla and Legendary's King Kong in an ecosystem of other giant super-species, both classic and new."[52]
Godzilla vs. Kongwas theatrically released internationally on March 24, 2021,[214][215]and released in the United States on March 31, 2021 simultaneously in theaters and onHBO Max.[216]Dougherty had expressed interest in directing aRay Harryhausen-esque prequel set during prehistoric times exploring how primitive humans survived against the Titans, humanity's first encounter with Godzilla, and how their relationship with Godzilla was christened.[217]

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]
Warner Bros. owns some shared universes. Some of them are based on books and comics, including some of the highest grossing IP's in the movie industry.
