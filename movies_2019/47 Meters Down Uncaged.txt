Mia andstepsisterSasha have just moved to a new school. Another student, Catherine, pushes Mia into the campus pool with Sasha as a bystander. Mia's father Grant learns about the incident and plans a boat ride for the sisters to see thegreat white sharks, hoping the two will bond. Grant gives Mia a tooth of a great white shark he found and recounts when Mia used to scuba dive with him.
On the day of the boat ride, Mia is shocked to see that Catherine and her friends are also there for the tour. Sasha's friends Alexa and Nicole arrive and tempt them both to go to a secret place with them. The girls get in Alexa's car and have a fun time together at the secret lagoon. Alexa reveals that thelagoonhas an entrance to a submergedMayancity where Grant and his two assistants—Carl and Alexa's boyfriend Ben—are working to prepare for a visit from a group ofarchaeologiststhe following week. After finding scuba gear, Nicole persuades the girls to dive through the city, eventually reaching an ancient sacrificial chamber. They encounter acavefish, and Nicole accidentally knocks over a stone column, causing a chain reaction of collapses.
The girls become separated by thesiltuntil Mia and Alexa find Ben, who is suddenly devoured by a shark and drops the guideline. The girls find each other and are chased by a shark into a tunnel, causing a cave-in to the lagoon's entrance. The girls decide to go back for the guideline but encounter a shark forcing the girls to swim deeper into the city until they reach an air pocket. Mia hears music in the water and leaves the girls behind in an attempt to get help. Elsewhere, Carl, who is listening to the music, is later attacked and killed by a shark. Mia eventually finds his body, and Grant saves her. The two reunite with the other girls, who came looking for her. They realize the shark is blind, having evolved within the caves, and they are able to distract the shark with sounds and make their escape. The group surfaces at a clearing where a pulley system ascender is set in place. However, two sharks come to the surface, and Nicole panics. She attempts to climb up the rope as Alexa is going up, inadvertently causing much of the rope and Alexa to fall back into the water. Nicole does climb up to reach an entrance, but instead she holds a loose rock, loses her grip, and also falls back, then she is ripped apart and devoured in a feeding frenzy by two sharks.
Grant explains that the only way out is to swim back down even deeper in order to find another exit, which will let them come out in the ocean, but is killed by a shark moments later. Mia, Sasha, and Alexa swim into the caves alone, eventually coming upon a strong current that catches Sasha and separates her from the others. Alexa makes it to the other entrance but is attacked by one of the sharks, and Mia is dragged into the current. Alexa escapes the shark by taking off her air tank but eventually drowns. Mia reunites with Sasha at the lower current, and they swim into a newly discovered cave. At the end of the cave, they find a crevice that leads to the surface, but a shark appears and attacks them. Climbing up the narrow crevice, both girls alternatively get caught in the tight space and must abandon their now empty air tanks to escape.
At the surface, they see a tour boat and startswimmingtowards it until they realize it ischummingthe water to attract sharks. Mia and Sasha get thetourists' attention as they are attacked by the sharks. While Mia makes it onto the boat, Sasha is grabbed by a shark. Mia jumps back into the water and shoots the shark with a flare gun, freeing Sasha. Sasha reaches the boat, but Mia is dragged into the water by another shark. She escapes by stabbing the shark's eye with the tooth given to her by Grant. Mia swims to the boat and reunites with Sasha as a shocked Catherine watches the boat's staff tend to their wounds.

Allen Media Group, alternately known by its former name ofEntertainment Studios, Inc.is an American media and entertainment company based inLos Angeles. Owned and founded in 1993 by businessmanByron Allen, the company was initially involved in the production and distribution of first-run television series forU.S.television syndication. Under theEntertainment Studios Networksdivision, it also operates a group ofdigital cableandsatellitechannels, which broadcast a mix of original programs and the company's syndicated content.
In the late 2010s, the company made several major expansions to its operations, including entering thefilm distributionmarket; acquiringThe Weather ChannelfromNBCUniversalandBain Capital; partnering withSinclair Broadcast Groupto operate theregional sports networkchainBally SportsviaDiamond Sports Group; and its acquisition of television stations from another minority-owned media group,Bayou City Broadcasting.
With television experience as being a former co-host of theNBCseriesReal Peoplefrom 1979 until 1984,stand-up comedianByron Allen launched his own weekly syndicatedlate-night talk show,The Byron Allen Show, in 1989. It was produced by his BYCA Productions andAllbritton Communications, and distributed by Genesis Entertainment.[5]
By 1991, Allen had created BYCA Television Distribution to take over distribution of his talk show as well as syndicate other programs.[6]By early 1993, Allen's talk show, which became a weeknightstripthe previous fall,[7]had been cancelled, and BYCA Television Distribution had been embroiled in a lawsuit filed by former employees who claimed they hadn't been paid by Allen.[8]Amidst the legal and financial issues, creditors forced BYCA intoChapter 7 bankruptcy.[9]The same year, Allen foundedCF Entertainment.[10][11]Following a similar business model to BYCA, Allen was able to succeed where he had failed before by focusing on producing low-cost, syndicated non-fiction programming, including interview series andcourt shows(largely scripted from actual testimony). Allen served as host for some of these programs.[12]In December 2003, CF became Entertainment Studios.[11]Entertainment Studiosgreen-litits first film and stage projects in December 2011, when it acquired the rights to develop abiographical filmandtheatrical playon the life ofSammy Davis Jr.from his daughter,Tracey Davis.[13]
The company ventured into scripted programming in 2012, with the third-quarter launch of the sitcomsMr. Box OfficeandThe First Family.[14]Both were set for 104 episodes[14]over two years under a model of accelerated production similar toDebmar-Mercury's10-90 Model.[15]The two half-hour shows were picked up as a two-hour weekend primetimeprogramming blockwith two episodes of each show back to back byTribune,WeigelandCBS Television Stationgroups.[14]
The company launched its eighth cable channel and first ad-supported service, Justice Central.TV, on December 10, 2012.[16]
In 2015, the company separately suedAT&T,Comcast, andCharter Communicationsfor racial discrimination in being biased against minority-run entertainment companies in not carrying its cable channels. AT&T settled in December with the addition of 7 of Entertainment Studios' channels added to AT&T'sDirecTVlineup. Entertainment Studios added similar suits against Charter and the FCC.[17]The Comcast case, though initially dismissed at the district court, was allowed to go forward by the Ninth Circuit; Comcast was able to successfully petition theSupreme Courtto hear its case inComcast v. National Association of African-American-Owned Mediain November 2019.
In October 2015, Entertainment Studios acquiredFreestyle Releasingfor an undisclosed amount "said to be sealed for high-eight figures". Freestyle also had an output deal withNetflix.[10]The Freestyle purchase was used to bolster an expansion intofilm distribution, via its new Entertainment Studios Motion Pictures division.[18][19]Its first release,47 Meters Down, took in $44 million in box office revenue.[12]
In June 2016, Entertainment Studios acquiredTheGrio, a news website focusing on stories of interest to African Americans.[20]
In mid-September 2017, the company announced plans to launch anover the topsports streaming service known as Sports.tv.[21]
On March 22, 2018, Entertainment Studios announced its intent to acquireThe Weather Channel's television assets from anNBCUniversal/Bain Capital/Blackstone Inc.partnership. The actual value was undisclosed, but was reported to be around $300 million; the channel'snon-television assets, which were separately sold to IBM two years prior, were not included in the sale.[3]In September 2018, Entertainment Studios announced that it had arranged $500 million worth ofcredit facilitiesthroughDeutsche BankSecurities,Jefferies Financial Group, Brightwood Capital Advisors andComerica. Allen explained that these funds were to be used for further "large-scale" acquisitions, productions, and other general expenses.[12][22]In an interview withVariety, Allen stated that he was "not a seller", and that he was "one or two acquisitions away from being a fairly large company".[12]
On May 3, 2019, it was announced that, under the subsidiary Diamond Sports Group, Entertainment Studios would be an equity and content partner inSinclair Broadcast Group's acquisition ofFox Sports Networks(now known asBally Sports).[23]On May 6, 2019, Entertainment Studios announced that it would expand into television station ownership by establishing the new unit, Allen Media Broadcasting. In June 2020, Comcast agreed to carry Entertainment Studios' Comedy.TV, JusticeCentral.TV, Recipe.TV, and The Weather Channel, and to retransmission consent for the Allen Media Broadcasting television stations, as part of a settlement of the Supreme Court racial discrimination lawsuit.[24]
In May 2021, Allen sued fast food chainMcDonald'sfor $10 billion, alleging that the company "intentionally discriminated against Entertainment Studios and Weather Group through a pattern of racial stereotyping and refusals to contract" for advertising across its properties.[25][26]
In July 2022, Allen Media Group acquiredBlack News Channelout of bankruptcy fromShahid Khanfor $11 million;[27]it was discontinued as a separate service, with its carriage merged into TheGrio.TV.[28][29]
Beginning in late April 2024, Allen Media Group laid off about 300 employees, or around 12 percent of its staff, throughout all of its operating divisions. The company's explanation for the staff reduction is to better position themselves for further growth.[30]Further layoffs took place in January 2025, with announced plans to lay off nearly all meteorologists from its local television stations in favor of centralizing weather coverage at The Weather Channel.[31][32]However, due to public feedback, Allen Media Group quickly changed its plan and will retain some local meteorology teams.[33]
Entertainment Studios has historically been known for itssyndicatedprograms, which are distributed using abarteredmodel that does not require stations to pay a rights fee. The company sells national advertising inventory guaranteeing an audience in aggregate across all of its programs, andshares the revenuewith stations.[34]Allen explained toBloombergin 2013 that this business model was attractive to stations that cannot afford to acquire programs from the syndication market, and that "we offer, across all our television shows, probably 20 million to 25 million viewers a week".[34]
The company has employed various cost-cutting techniques, including using non-union staff, and streamlining productions to reduce their complexity—a technique that also allows it to produce programming at an accelerated pace.[34]A prominent example of these practices are present in the company'scourt shows, which are dramatized with actors rather thanarbitration-basedlike other popular entries in the genre; Allen explained that with this model, "we don't have the cost of airfare, hotels, security; we don't have the costs of the claims, the settlements."[34]The studio's first production—Entertainers with Byron Allen—bypassed budget constraints by filming interviews atpress junkets, using equipment that was provided byfilm studiosfor use by the media.[35]
These practices have allowed some of Entertainment Studios programs to bring in sizable amounts of advertising revenue, even with clearances inlesser-viewed time slotssuch aslate night, or without having produced new episodes in an extended period.[34]

In January of that year, on his film distribution model, Allen said:[19]
We're chasing the studio crumbs. They don't want movies that do $40 million to $60 million. We totally will be good with those numbers, and that is what we're pursuing. Our thing is we are really big on slow roll-outs and small releases. Our philosophy—we believe in wide releases. We like to have movies that are 1,500–4,000 screens and we are chasing what the studios don't want. They're chasing much bigger. And we're going to take their crumbs and make a gourmet meal. And then eventually we'll move on to chasing more than their crumbs. But today we're chasing the crumbs.

I love black men, but the reality is the sistahs are marrying white men and the brothas are marrying white women and that's the world that we live in and it's not to be judged, and if it works for you then embrace it". DirectorMalcolm D. Leealso supported the interracial relationship being portrayed in the film: "African-American women who are extremely successful can't always find black male counterparts on that level so it's a little bit of a reflection of reality that black women are starting to date outside their race — and why not?"[16]
