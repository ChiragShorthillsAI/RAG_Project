Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vileis a 2019 Americanbiographicalcrime drama filmabout the life of serial killerTed Bundy.[2]Directed byJoe Berlingerwith a screenplay from Michael Werwie, the film is based on Bundy's former girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall's memoir,The Phantom Prince: My Life with Ted Bundy. The film starsZac Efronas Bundy,Lily Collinsas Kendall,Kaya Scodelarioas Bundy's wife Carole Ann Boone, andJohn MalkovichasEdward Cowart, the presiding judge at Bundy's trial. The title of the film is a reference to Cowart's remarks on Bundy's murders while sentencing him to death.
Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vilehad its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 26, 2019, and was released in the United States on May 3, 2019, byNetflix. The film received mixed reviews from critics, though Efron and Collins' performances were praised.
In 1969Seattle, law studentTed Bundymeets Liz Kendall, a young secretary and divorced mother. The two begin dating, and Ted helps Liz raise her young daughter, Molly.
By 1974, news reports announce the recent murders of multiple young women, including two who disappeared in broad daylight atLake Sammamish; a man resembling Ted was seen by several people asking women to help him load a kayak onto aVolkswagen Beetle. Acomposite sketchof the attacker is released and, following hundreds of phone calls, Ted is arrested the following year.
A young woman named Carol DaRonch picks Ted out of apolice lineup, claiming he had kidnapped and threatened to kill her before she managed to escape. Ted is released on bail, returning home to Liz who is upset after reading an article about him in the newspaper. Ted explains that Carol was shown his picture before the lineup took place, which is why he looked familiar to her, and says he believes he is being set up. After a four-daybench trial, Ted is found guilty of aggravated kidnapping and is sentenced to serve a minimum of one to a maximum of 15 years in theUtah State Prison.
A few weeks later, Colorado authorities charge Ted with the murder of Caryn Campbell, and he is transferred toAspen, Colorado, in 1977. Liz refuses to believe Ted is guilty, but the events start to take a toll on her, and she begins drinking heavily as a result. While atPitkin County Courthouse, Ted elects to serve as his own attorney and, as such, is excused from wearing handcuffs or leg shackles. During a court recess, Ted escapes from the courthouse by jumping out of a second-story window and running to the mountains through the town, but is recaptured after six days.
Liz visits Ted and ends their relationship. He later escapes again after sawing a square into his cell's ceiling. Two women at a sorority house are murdered atFlorida State University, followed by vicious attacks on three more. After Ted is arrested, he tries to contact Liz, but she hangs up on him. He starts to receive a following of women who are fascinated by him, some even claiming they love him. Ted is also visited by an old friend, Carole Ann Boone, who believes he is innocent and moves to Florida to be closer to him during his upcoming murder trial.
A pre-trialplea bargainis negotiated in which Ted would plead guilty to killing the two sorority girls, Lisa Levy and Margaret Bowman, and twelve-year-old Kimberly Leach, in exchange for a 75-year prison sentence instead of the death penalty, but he refuses. Ted and Carole Ann grow closer as she visits him regularly; the two begin a relationship, but Ted continues to reach out to Liz who is following his trials via television. She carries the guilt of being the person who gave Ted's name to the Seattle authorities in 1975. Ted later proposes to Carole Ann mid-trial and they marry.
Incriminating physical evidence is provided in court, including a match of aplaster castof Ted's teeth to the impressions of bite wounds left on Levy's buttocks. In under seven hours, the jury convicts Ted of the murders of Levy and Bowman, three counts of attempted first-degree murder, and two counts of burglary. Trial judgeEdward Cowartimposes death sentences for the murders.
Ten years later, Liz receives a letter from Ted and visits him, taking a photograph given to her by a detective. She demands the truth but Ted continues to deny having anything to do with the murders and proclaims his innocence. She then shows Ted a photograph, a crime scene image of one of his decapitated victims, and he finally admits that he sawed her head off by writing the word "hacksaw" in the condensation on the visiting room window that separates them. Liz leaves the prison in shock but is met outside by her new husband Jerry, and Molly, now a teenager, and she proclaims that she is finally okay.
As the film ends, archival footage and on-screen text say that Ted was executed in January 1989, aged 42 years old. Ted had confessed to over 30 murders days before his execution, and asked that his ashes be scattered in theCascade Mountains, where he had deposited the remains of numerous victims.
Molly Kendall, Liz's daughter, is portrayed at different ages by Macie Carmosino, Ava Inman, Morgan Pyle, and Grace Balbo. DirectorJoe Berlingerand cinematographerBrandon Trostmake cameo appearances as the presenter and cameraman who interview Ted in Colorado.
The project was unveiled at the2017 Cannes Film Festival, withZac Efronset to star as the serial killerTed Bundy, and documentary filmmakerJoe Berlingersigned to direct.[3]In October 2017,Lily Collinswas cast as Bundy's girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall.[4]
In January 2018,John Malkovichwas cast to playEdward Cowart, the judge presiding over Bundy's case. Principal production began on January 18, 2018, inCovington, Kentucky.[5]Angela Sarafyan,Jeffrey Donovan,Grace Victoria Cox,Kaya Scodelario,Jim Parsons,Haley Joel Osment,Dylan BakerandTerry Kinneyjoined the film throughout the rest of January,[6][7][8][9][10][11]withMetallicaguitarist and lead singerJames Hetfieldbeing added in February.[12]
The film had its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 26, 2019.[13]Shortly after,Netflixacquired the domestic distribution rights to the film for $9 million.[14]It was digitally released on the platform on May 3, 2019, along with a limited theatrical release.[15][16][17]
The film was theatrically released in several overseas markets, grossing a total of $9.8 million, with its largest markets being Mexico ($5.6 million) and Italy ($1.1 million).[1]
Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 54% based on 182 reviews, and an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vileoften transcends its narrative limitations through sheer force of Zac Efron's compulsively watchable performance."[18]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[19]
Owen GleibermanofVarietypraised Efron's performance for his accuracy in portraying Bundy, and wrote: "Extremely Wickeddoesn't rub our noses in the horror of Ted Bundy. It shows us just enough, keeping the horror where it belongs, in the recesses of our imagination, where it remains what it should be: dark as midnight, and altogether too much to fathom."[20]The Guardian's Benjamin Lee gave the film three out of five stars, also praising Efron but calling the film itself a "pedestrian and graceless drama". He criticized Collins's performance, saying she was reduced to a stock character.[21]Writing forVulture, Emily Yoshida had a similar perspective, praising Efron but disliking the rest of the film, and saying, "The narrative feature from veteran documentarian Joe Berlinger seems as though it's setting out to be the story of serial killer Ted Bundy told through the eyes of his girlfriend ... But Berlinger's film gets sucked into the gravity of sensational events that are already a matter of public record, and spends so much time meticulously recreating them that the perspective is diluted."[22]
Sonia Rao ofThe Washington Postwrote that the film failed to distance itself from the glorification of Bundy and did not address the impact of his crimes on his victims' loved ones.[23]

This was because at this time all of Sky's other channels includingSky Sports, were shown free-to-air and during this period, the service was often referred to asSky Movies Plus(up until 31 August 1993 shortly before the launch ofthe new Multichannels package). When Sky Sports became a pay channel on 1 September 1992, Sky Movies stopped showing non-movie related programming.

Sky Movies was overhauled on 4 April 2007, when the different channels became dedicated to different genres,[13]but three of the HD channels have launched already before the other:[citation needed]
Sky later made Sky Movies HD1 and HD2 available to subscribers withoutHDTVequipment through two channels simulcasting the same content inSDTVformat, the channels were known as Sky Movies SD1 and SD2. These channels were renamed Sky Movies Screen 1 and Screen 2 in February 2008, and the HDTV channels were renamed Sky Movies Screen 1 HD and Screen 2 HD accordingly.[14]On 20 March 2008, an additional high-definition film channel called Sky Movies Premiere HD, which is a simulcast version of the current Sky Movies Premiere channel, was added after many requests for the channel from Sky HD subscribers.[original research?]

To facilitate the channel, Sky Movies Classics has ceased broadcasting, when Sky Movies Modern Greats was rebranded as Sky Movies Greats and Sky Movies Indie became Sky Movies Select,[25][26]whether the content of the three former brands was merged into Select and Greats.[27]
On 15 June 2016, Sky announced that Sky Movies would rebrand asSky Cinemaon 8 July within this change aligns the channel's naming with those of Sky's film services in other European countries, in consort with Sky plc's takeover ofSky DeutschlandandSky Italia.

On 30 June 2020, several of Sky Cinema's standard definition channels were fully discontinued. This move also coincided with the Sky Cinema brand adopting the 2020 Sky channel branding previously adopted by the entertainment channels following the launch ofSky Comedy. On 30 March 2022, the SD feeds of Sky Cinema Comedy, Sky Cinema Thriller and Sky Cinema Drama were similarly withdrawn.[32]On 29 May 2024, the SD feeds of Sky Cinema Premiere, Sky Cinema Greats, Sky Cinema Family and Sky Cinema Action were removed from Sky.[33]

In 1998Elisabeth Murdoch(who was BSkyB's director of channels and services at the time) advocated Sky setting up a film funding and production unit (similar toBBC FilmandFilm4 Productions). The result was Sky Pictures, which existed in order to investing both low-budget and mainstream British films. However, following a lack of success and her decision to leave Sky and set up her own production company calledShine, the unit was scaled back and closed in 2001.[citation needed]

Joseph Berlinger(born October 30, 1961) is an American documentary filmmaker and producer. Particularly focused ontrue crimedocumentaries, Berlinger's films and docu-series draw attention tosocial justiceissues in the US and abroad in such films asBrother's Keeper,Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills,Crude,Whitey: United States of America v. James J. BulgerandIntent To Destroy: Death, Denial and Depiction.
A 2017HuffPostarticle stated, "Brother's Keeper"(1992) and the "Paradise Losttrilogy" (1996–2011) helped pioneer the style of documentary filmmaking seen in Netflix's recent true crime sensation,Making a Murderer—a combination of artful cinematography, a stirring musical soundtrack, and a dramatic narrative structure as compelling as any scripted film."[1]
Berlinger spearheaded and directed two 2019 projects centered on the infamous serial killerTed Bundy: theNetflixdocu-seriesConversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,[2]and the drama filmExtremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, starringZac Efron.[3]In 2022 Bloomberg described Berlinger as a "True Crime Hit Factory" for Netflix whose work has "redefined crime documentaries as a vehicle for social justice." The article also quoted Adam Del Deo, VP for original documentary series at Netflix: “He’s the gold standard in true crime. The moral compass that he has, the sense of responsibility he has for victims and for getting the story right and shining a light on it, that is something that is very unique.”[4]
Berlinger was born to a Jewish family[5]inBridgeport, Connecticut.[6]He graduated fromColgate Universityin 1983[7]with a B.A. in German Language.
After graduating from Colgate University, Berlinger took a position working at an advertising agency inFrankfurt, Germany. He soon transitioned into the world of film, working as an apprentice to the iconic documentariansAlbert and David Maysles. Joe met his future directing partner,Bruce Sinofsky, while they were both employed by the Maysles. Together they would make their directing debut with the 1992 filmBrother's Keeper.
Working as a directing duo,Berlinger and Sinofskycreated the landmark documentaryBrother's Keeper(1992),[8]which tells the story of Delbert Ward, an uneducated elderly man in Munnsville, New York, who was charged with second-degree murder following the death of his brother William. Film critic Roger Ebert called it "an extraordinary documentary about what happened next, as a town banded together to stop what folks saw as a miscarriage of justice."[8]
The pair went on to direct the Paradise Lost Trilogy--Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills(1996),[9]Paradise Lost 2: Revelations(2000),[9]andParadise Lost 3: Purgatory(2011),[9]which earned the pair an Academy Award nomination.[10]The trilogy, shot over two decades, focused on theWest Memphis Three, a group of teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of the brutal murder of three children. The trilogy raised doubts about the legitimacy of the teenagers' convictions and spurred a movement to release them from prison, where one of the men was awaiting a death sentence. In 2011, the West Memphis Three were released from their respective death and life sentences after filing anAlford Pleawith the Federal Court of Arkansas.
Metallica: Some Kind of Monster(2004),[11]called "one of the most revelatory rock portraits ever made"[12]follows the popular heavy metal bandMetallica. Berlinger and Sinofsky capture the group at a crossroads, as bassistJason Newstedquits the band and frontmanJames Hetfieldabruptly leaves to enter a rehabilitation facility due to alcohol abuse. The film was critically acclaimed for capturing Metallica, a global phenomenon, at a moment of true vulnerability.
Sinofsky died on February 21, 2015, at the age of 58, fromdiabetes-related complications. The band Metallica paid tribute to him as a "courageous man with deep empathy and wisdom who wasn't afraid to dig deep to tell the story.[13]" Berlinger wrote that Sinofsky's "humanity is on every frame of the films that he leaves behind."[13]
Berlinger made his narrative feature debut withBook of Shadows: Blair Witch 2(2000).[14]
Berlinger's filmCrude(2009) focused on the lawsuit by Ecuadorean plaintiffs againstChevron Corporation, for its alleged responsibility for continuing sites of pollution in that country.[15]Under African Skies(2012), followsPaul Simonas he returns to South Africa for a reunion concert, celebrating the 25th anniversary of his landmark albumGracelandwhich featured many iconic South African Musicians. In 2014Whitey: United States of America V. James J. Bulger, a documentary about the infamous Boston mob bossWhitey Bulgerwas released. Berlinger traces Whitey's trail of terror as well as the FBI's role in both enabling him and taking him down.
Berlinger capturedTony Robbins' exclusive and notoriously privateDate With Destinyseminar in his 2016 filmTony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru. Berlinger chronicles the six-day seminar and the personal evolutions and breakthroughs of participants, Robbins and even Berlinger himself.
In 2017 Berlinger releasedIntent to Destroy: Death, Denial & Depiction, an examination of theArmenian genocidethrough both seated interviews with experts and behind-the-scenes footage ofTerry George's historical dramaThe Promise(2016).
In 2019, Berlinger re-entered the world of narrative film and directedExtremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, his second feature. The film chronicles the life of serial killerTed Bundyand his longtime girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall. StarringZac Efron,Lily Collins,Jim Parsons,John Malkovich,Jeffrey Donovan,Haley Joel OsmentandAngela Sarafyan, the film screened at the2019 Sundance Film Festivalin January.[16]
In addition to his feature work, Berlinger has created or played pivotal roles as executive producer, director and/or producer of many acclaimed television series, such as the Emmy-winning10 Days That Unexpectedly Changed Americafor History, the Emmy-nominatedOprah's Master Classfor OWN, and the star-studdedIconoclastsfor Sundance, which paired creative visionaries across multiple disciplines - such as Eddie Vedder and Laird Hamilton, Chuck D and Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Charlize Theron and Jane Goodall - for tandem portraits and discussions about their lives, influences, and art.
Berlinger continued his passion for using media to bring attention to the issue of wrongful conviction with his television seriesWrong Manfor Starz, which took an in-depth look into six separate cases of alleged wrongful conviction over two seasons.[17]Confronting A Serial Killer, which premiered in April 2021 on Starz, follows acclaimed author Jillian Lauren as she forms an unprecedented bond with the most prolific serial killer in American history,Samuel Little. Lauren uncovers Little's darkest secrets, aids law enforcement in solving a multitude of cold case murders targeting marginalized communities, and examines how flaws in our criminal justice system aided in him escaping legal consequences for decades.
Since 2019'sConversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy TapesandExtremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile,Berlinger has spearheaded multiple hit documentary series for Netflix, includingJeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich(2020),Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel(2021), andMadoff: The Monster of Wall Street(2023).
In collaboration with journalist Greg Milner, Berlinger wrote the bookMetallica: This Monster Lives(2004), about his early career, accomplishments and challenges forging his path in the world of film. The book is centered around the filming ofMetallica: Some Kind of Monster.
Berlinger serves on the board of Proclaim Justice, a nonprofit dedicated to providing resources and building awareness around wrongful convictions. He also serves on the board ofRehabilitation Through the Arts, The Bedford Playhouse and theInternational Documentary Association.
Chevron Corporationsubpoenaed the outtakes from Berlinger's 2009 filmCrude. Berlinger fought the request, citingreporters' privilege, but in 2010 a federal judge ordered Berlinger to turn over more than 600 hours of footage created during the film's production.[15]Berlinger appealed, but in 2011 the US 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court ruling against Berlinger, though with a slight reduction in the total hours of footage required.[18][19][full citation needed][20]
After spending $1.3 million on legal fees on the case, Berlinger expressed concerns about being able to make documentaries about legal cases in the future.[9]
Berlinger is best known for the film seriesParadise Lost,[21]which documents the murder trial and the subsequent legal battles of three Arkansas teenagers, Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley Jr.,  convicted of murder.[9]The court convicted the youths (known as theWest Memphis Three) of murdering three eight-year-old boys as part of a "ritual killing,"[9]although no physical evidence linked the three young men to the crime.[citation needed]Paradise Lostdocuments the 20-year ordeal of these three young men from arrest to conviction, through years of unsuccessful legal efforts, to a plea bargain that resulted in their release in the summer of 2012.[9]
The film series brought mainstream attention to the case, and many celebrities took up the cause of getting these young men out of prison and gettingDamien Echolsoffdeath row. The mainstream attention, brought on by the documentary series, allowed for a well-financed legal team to investigate every lead in the case. These subsequent investigations showed the incompetence of the West Memphis police, who had never dealt with this type of crime, and that the police let other suspects disappear from the community; for example, a man covered in blood used a restroom in a restaurant within walking distance of the murder scene shortly after the time of the murders. In addition to the failure to apprehend the suspect, the police lost the blood samples, even though this strange man left blood all over the bathroom. This mistake meant that the experts could never determine if this strange man was covered in the victims' blood.
Ultimately, the defense team hired DNA experts to test genetic material after fighting the prosecution for years to get access to it, and these tests again proved that no physical evidence linked the West Memphis Three to the murders; rather, a hair from one boy's stepfather was found tied into one of the shoelaces used to hogtie the victims.[22]
After a 2010 decision by theArkansas Supreme Courtregarding newly produced DNA evidence,[23]attorneys for theWest Memphis Threenegotiated with prosecutors anAlford pleaallowing them to assert their innocence while acknowledging enough evidence to convict them; the result, on August 19, 2011, was acceptance of the pleas by Judge David Laser, and his reduction of sentence of the three to time served, and their release with 10-yearsuspended sentences(after 18 years, 78 days in prison).[24]
Joe Berlinger lives with his wife, artist Loren Eiferman, inWestchester County, New York.[citation needed]
