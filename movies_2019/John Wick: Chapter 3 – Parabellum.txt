John Wickis on the run inManhattanafter he was labeled "excommunicado" for killing of High Table crime lord Santino D'Antonio on Continental grounds.[a]At theNew York Public Library, John retrieves a marker medallion and arosary. He is injured in a fight with another hitman, Ernest, and seeks medical treatment from an underworld doctor. His excommunicado status activates before the doctor can finish, forcing John to complete the suturing himself. Upon leaving, he is quickly pursued by various gangs of assassins, all of whom he kills.
John meets with The Director, the head of theRuska Romacrime syndicate, to whom he presents a rosary and demands safe passage toCasablanca. As John was once a member, the Director reluctantly agrees. It is also revealed that John Wick's birth name was Jardani Jovonovich. Meanwhile, a High TableAdjudicatormeets with New York Continental manager Winston and theBoweryKing, notifying them that they both have seven days to resign from their positions as a consequence of helping John. The Adjudicator enlists Zero, a Japanese assassin, and orders him to stab the Director throughboth of her handsas penance for aiding John. In Casablanca, John meets Sofia, his former friend and manager of the Moroccan Continental.
John presents the marker, which binds Sofia to repay a debt to John (John had previously rescued Sofia's daughter and placed her in hiding). John demands to be directed to the Elder, the only person above the High Table, who alone can rescind John's excommunicado status. Sofia begrudgingly takes John to Berrada, her former boss, who tells John he may find the Elder only by wandering through the desert until he can no longer walk. When Sofia refuses to give Berrada one of her trainedBelgian Malinoisin return for his help, he shoots the dog, but hits its bulletproof vest. John prevents Sofia from killing Berrada. They fight their way out of thekasbahand drive into the desert, where she leaves John.
Seven days later, the Adjudicator and Zero confront the Bowery King, who refuses toabdicatehis position. In response, Zero's students slaughter the Bowery King's men while Zero slashes the Bowery King seven times with awakizashi. Meanwhile, John collapses in the desert and is brought to the Elder.
John states that he wants to live to keep the memory of the love he once had with his late wife.[b]The Elder agrees to forgive John under the condition of killing Winston and subservience to the High Table for the remainder of his life. To show hisfealty, John severs his ring finger and gives his wedding ring to The Elder.
Upon returning to New York, John is attacked by Zero and his students before reaching the protection of the Continental. The Adjudicator arrives, but Winston refuses to abdicate, and John refuses to kill him, leading the Adjudicator to revoke the Continental's neutral status and send both Zero and an army of heavily armed High Table enforcers to kill John and Winston. Winston provides John with weapons and the assistance of concierge Charon and his staff. After killing all the enforcers, Zero and his students ambush John; John proceeds to kill all but two. Zero battles John, but is eventually defeated and left to die. On the roof of the Continental, The Adjudicator agrees to aparleywith Winston, who offers allegiance to the High Table.
John arrives; Winston shoots him, and he falls to the street below. Winston reassumes his position, and the severely injured John is secretly delivered to the Bowery King in an underground bunker; the two agree to join forces against the High Table.
In October 2016,Chad Stahelski, who made his directorial debut withJohn Wickand served as Reeves'Matrixstunt double,[11]stated that a third film in theJohn Wickseries was in the works,[12]and in June 2017, it was reported thatDerek Kolstad, who wrote the two prior films, would return to write the screenplay.[13]In January 2018, it was reported that Stahelski would return to direct.[14]
According to Reeves, the film's title was taken from the famous 4th-century Roman military quote "Si vis pacem, para bellum", which means, "If you want peace, prepare for war."[15]In an interview with theNew York Times, McShane said that the film would be big and good and that nothing is the same while also hinting that part of the action could be the High Table's payback not only on Wick but also on his close friend Winston.[16]
In January 2018, it was reported thatHiroyuki Sanadawas in talks to join the cast.[14]Sanada was originally going to be Zero, but suffered a torn Achilles tendon, and the role was given toMark Dacascos.[17]Later, it was revealed thatIan McShane,Laurence Fishburne, andLance Reddickwould reprise their roles from previousJohn Wickfilms.[18]In May 2018,Halle Berry,Anjelica Huston,Asia Kate Dillon,Mark Dacascos,Jason Mantzoukas,Yayan Ruhian, Cecep Arif Rahman, andTiger Chenjoined the cast.[19][20][21]In November 2018,Said Taghmaouiconfirmed his involvement in the film.[22]
Principal photography began May 5, 2018, in New York City, along with additional filming locations inCasablanca. Principal photography lasted until November 17, 2018.[18][22][23]CinematographerDan Laustsenwas asked about how challenging it was to use as many extended fight scene takes as possible while filming the high action screenplay. He stated, "Of course it is [a challenge], because all the fights—Chad [Stahelski] is doing most of the fights himself. We play that as wide as we can. Because that way we see it's him. We do that a lot, we try to play it as wide as we can and do long shots. Of course, because Chad has a background from the stunt world he knows exactly how to block this kind of stuff. I'm not the best stunt person in the world, but I'm learning."[24]In an interview withJimmy Fallon, Halle Berry said that she "broke three ribs in rehearsal."[25]
The action scene with a hitman named Ernest, played byNBAbasketball playerBoban Marjanović, was inspired by theBruce LeefilmGame of Death(1972), where Lee fights NBA basketball playerKareem Abdul-Jabbar.[26]Unlike most of the other stunt scenes, Ernest has a few lines bantering with John Wick, but he still loses.

Huston was born on July 8, 1951, at 6:29 p.m., in theCedars of Lebanon Hospital, in Los Angeles,[3]to director and actorJohn Hustonandprima ballerinaand modelEnrica Soma.[4]According to Huston, "the news of my arrival was cabled promptly to the post office in the township ofButiaba, in WesternUganda[and two] days later, a barefoot runner bearing a telegram finally arrived atMurchison Falls", where her father was filmingThe African Queen(1951).[3]Huston's paternal grandfather was Canadian-born actorWalter Huston. Huston has Scottish, Irish, English and Welsh ancestry from her father, and Italian from her mother.[5]
When Huston was 2 years old, her family relocated to Ireland, where she spent much of her childhood and which she still considers home.[6]Her parents rented what Huston called the "Courtown House" — a tall stone Victorian manor inCounty Kildare— for three years, before John Huston bought St. Clerans, a 110-acre estate inCounty Galway, in 1954.[3]She attended school atKylemore Abbey,[7]and later attendedHolland Park Schoolafter relocating to England.[8]
Huston has a complex family because of her parents' multiple marriages and extramarital affairs. She has an older brother, Tony, and an adopted older brother, Pablo. She has a younger maternal half-sister namedAllegra, whom she called "Legs", and a younger paternal half-brother, actorDanny Huston. She is the aunt of actorJack Huston.[9]She once described herself as a "lonely child", explaining: "My brother Tony and I were never very close, neither as children nor as adults, but I was tightly bound to him. We were forced to be together because we were really quite alone. We were in the middle of the Irish countryside ... and we didn't see many other kids. We were tutored. Our father was mostly away [for filming]".[3]
Her father's filmA Walk with Love and Death(1969), where Huston played the 16-year-old French noblewoman Claudia oppositeAssi Dayan, marked her screen debut. She had been in the running to play Juliet in directorFranco Zeffirelli's adaptation ofRomeo and Juliet(1968), but Huston withdrew herself from consideration when her father decided to cast her as Claudia inA Walk With Love and Death. Huston felt that she was wrong for the role as Claudia, and has commented on the experience that her father "miscast me first time out and I think he realized that. I was ready to act, but I wasn't ready to act for him ... I was difficult, I didn't want to act with no makeup, although I'd have done it for Franco."[10]Father and daughter had a fractious relationship on set, with the young Anjelica having difficulty learning her lines and focusing, while her father grew more impatient and angry at directing her.[11]Critics derided her performance.
Huston and her mother were photographed by Arnaud De Rosnay —whom she met at age 16 inSwitzerland— in October 1968 forVogue.[12]Shortly afterwards, her mother died in a car accident, and the young Huston relocated to New York City as she "sort of fled London because of the memories; I didn't really know what to do with myself, and I wasn't quite sure what my father's intentions were for me —whether he was going to put me in a convent or launch me as an actress. Well, he'd already tried to do that, and we'd had a hard time on the making of that first film we did together".[12][13]Inspired by modelsJean ShrimptonandTwiggy, Huston decided to pursue modelling, and through photographerRichard Avedon, a friend of her parents, she metDiana Vreelandwho proposed to Huston her first AmericanVoguephotoshoot, which took place in Ireland.[12]She described it as "very innovative because they presaged the whole sort ofGypsylook".[12]
Huston became a frequent subject ofBob Richardson, with whom she lived until 1973.[14]She was signed toFord Modelsand in the early 1970s, worked in Europe "for a couple of years".[12]She walked the runway for brands such asZandra Rhodes,Yamamoto,ArmaniandValentino. Along withPat Cleveland,Pat Ast,Elsa Peretti,Karen BjornsonandAlva Chinn, she became one of fashion designerHalston's favored troupe of models, nicknamed the Halstonettes.[15][16]
After breaking up with Richardson, Huston met actorJack Nicholsonand moved toCalifornia, to focus on acting.[12]While she "didn't do much there for three years", she filmed a small role inThe Last Tycoon(1976), based onF. Scott Fitzgerald'snovel of the same name.Bob Rafelson's remakeThe Postman Always Rings Twice(1981), based on thenovelbyJames M. Cain, featured Huston as the fling of a Depression-era drifter, played by Nicholson. She briefly appeared in the dramaFrances(1982) and the mockumentaryThis Is Spinal Tap(1984) before obtaining a larger role in the science fiction filmThe Ice Pirates(1984).
Her father cast Huston as Maerose, the daughter of a New York Mafia clan head whose love is scorned by a hit man, in the film adaptationPrizzi's Honor(1985), which also starred Nicholson. She was paid theSAG-AFTRAscale rate of US$14,000 for her role. When her agent called up the movie's producer to request if she could be paid more, she was told "Go to hell. Be my guest — ask for more money. We don't even want her in this movie." Huston, who was not only John Huston's daughter but also Jack Nicholson's girlfriend at the time, wrote in her 2014 memoirWatch Methat she later overheard a production worker saying: "Her father is the director, her boyfriend's the star, and she has no talent."[17]Nevertheless, Huston garnered positive notices for her performance.The New York Timesdescribed her part as a "wonderful character, far darker and more complex than is indicated by her self-deprecating wisecracks (I'm a family scandal. I got a reputation to keep up). She's a riveting presence and if Miss Huston, the daughter of the director, doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this performance, I'll be very surprised."[18]Indeed, she won theAcademy AwardforBest Supporting Actress, making her the third generation of her family to win an Oscar.
Huston starred oppositeMichael Jacksonin the 17-minute US$30 million3D filmCaptain EO, written byGeorge Lucasand directed byFrancis Ford Coppola, which ran from 1986 atDisneylandandEpcot, and later atTokyo DisneylandandEuro Disneyland.[19]Coppola next cast her as the girlfriend of an army platoon sergeant inGardens of Stone(1987), a film that dealt with the effect of theVietnam Waron the United States homefront.[20]Film criticRoger Ebertpraised her onscreen chemistry with co-starJames Caan, remarking that "the romance between Caan and Huston is one of the great adult love stories in recent movies".[21]
Huston starred in her father's last film, 1987'sThe Dead, as the wife of an academic. According to her, her father remained a filmmaking virtuoso despite his ill health: "He was so sick, but he could literally do it with his eyes closed. He knew when we were going to get a take way long before the camera rolled. I mean the timing was so precise that he could tell everything, exactly how it was going to go."[10]The pressures of filming and watching her father's health deteriorate had an adverse effect on Anjelica Huston's own health, developingEpstein-Barrsyndrome during production.[10]John  died nearly four months before the film's release date, upon which it received two nominations at the60th Academy Awards. For her performance, she won asBest Supporting Femaleat the3rd Independent Spirit Awards.
In 1988, Huston played the love interest of an engaging, multi-talented, middle-classYale Universitygraduate inMr. North, which was more of a family project, directed by half-brotherDanny Huston, and made a cameo appearance in the film adaptationA Handful of Dust. Despite her limited screen time,Vincent CanbyofThe New York Timespraised her portrayal in the latter as the "single most stunning performance" but called the film "both too literal and devoid of real point."[22]
Huston earned aBAFTAnomination forBest Supporting Actressfor her portrayal of a flight attendant having an affair with a respected family guy inWoody Allen's dramedyCrimes and Misdemeanors(1989). The dramaEnemies, A Love Story, also released in 1989, featured her as the long-vanished wife of aHolocaustsurvivor. In a positive review for the film, Roger Ebert asserted: "Parts, especially the scenes with Huston, are heartwarming in a strange way, because they show one human being accepting the weaknesses of another".[23]For her role, she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.
InThe Witches(1990), based on the 1983book of the same namebyRoald Dahl, Huston starred as theGrand High Witch, the all-powerful leader of the world's witches. She and the costume designerMarit Allenoriginally brought a different dress for the role, but the directorNicolas Roegrejected it as "not sexy". Huston recalled: "That was the first time I'd imagined that this horrible creature in a children's movie should have sex appeal. It simply had not occurred to me. But of course, Nic was absolutely right. His vision was diabolical and dark and brilliantly funny. If a witch was to be at the center of this plot, she needed to be sexy to hold the eye."[24]The character's monstrous version was prepared byJim Henson's Creature Shopand "took over six hours to apply and almost as much time to remove at the end of the day."[24]Despite a lackluster box office response, the film was applauded by critics and has obtained acult followingover the years; it has also remained one of Huston's favorite roles.[25]
Huston next portrayed a veteran con artist in theneo-noirthrillerThe Grifters(also 1990). DirectorStephen Frearsfirst contacted her about playing Lilly in 1989 while she was filmingCrimes and Misdemeanors, but after reading the script, she was unsure.[26]Although she was "transfixed" by the story and the character, the script alarmed her with its explicitness.[27]A few months later, Frears contacted Huston again to see if she was still interested.[26]Still wavering, Huston's talent agentSue Mengerstold her bluntly "Anjelica, if Stephen Frears tells you he wants you to shit in the corner, then that's what you must do." The next day Huston auditioned for the role in front of Frears at theChateau Marmont. Frears' initial reluctance to cast Huston because she looked too much like "a lady", was resolved with the decision to cheapen her look with a bleached blond wig and "vulgar clothes". To research her part, she studied women dealers at card parlors in Los Angeles County, California.[26]Her performance earned her a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Actress.
Huston obtained the part ofMorticia Addams, the stern, aloof matriarch of the titular family, inThe Addams Family(1991). She based aspects of her performance on her friendJerry Hallto give the character more warmth, and in her 2014 memoirWatch Me, she described the filming as "long and arduous".[28]It was decided that the character of Morticia should have eyes which slanted upwards at the sides, an effect which was achieved by attaching an elastic strap to the back of Huston's head via fabric tabs glued at her temples, which pulled the corners of her eyes upwards.[27]The bands caused extended discomfort to Huston, and would snap at the slightest turn of Huston's head, causing a grueling repair time. Eventually, she learned to pivot and turn on her feet without moving her upper body or head.[27]The Addams Familywas a commercial success, grossing over US$191 million worldwide,[29]and prompted a sequel,Addams Family Values(1993). For both installments, Huston garneredGolden Globe Awardnominations for Best Actress –Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.[30]
Following a small role in the satireThe Player(1992), Huston reunited with Woody Allen onManhattan Murder Mystery, in which she played the friend of a married couple investigating the death of their neighbor's wife, and also portrayed a mother struggling to parent her autistic child, in the ABC miniseriesFamily Pictures. She received aBAFTAnomination for Best Supporting Actress forManhattan Murder Mystery, and a nomination forBest Actress – Miniseries or Television Filmat the51stGolden Globe AwardsforFamily Pictures. In 1995, Huston portrayed a Cuban refuge attempting to stay in America in the comedyThe Perez Familyand the former wife of a tormented man (played byJack Nicholson) inSean Penn's sophomore directorial effort, the dramaThe Crossing Guard. Her performance in the latter was praised,[31]and she received nominations for Best Supporting Actress from theHollywood Foreign Pressand theScreen Actors Guild. Based on the1990 novel of the same name,[32]theCBSminiseriesBuffalo Girls—in which she starred as frontierswomanCalamity Jane, oppositeMelanie GriffithandReba McEntire— earned Huston anEmmy Awardnomination forOutstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie.
After contemplating the idea of following in her father's footsteps, Huston started to put out "discreet feelers" and pursue material in Hollywood she felt attracted to direct. The studios' overall response was "swift and positive, with the usual blinders", according to Huston. "What they offered me had invariably something to do with my father. I didn't want to do a sequel toPrizzi's Honor.Prizzibelongs to him. I wanted to do something that, succeed or fail, would be my own."[33]She found it in the dramaBastard Out of Carolina, based on anovelbyDorothy Allison, about an impoverished girl who endures physical and sexual abuse. It was screened in theUn Certain Regardsection at the1996 Cannes Film Festival,[34]and debuted as a television film onShowtime. She was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award forOutstanding Directing for a Miniseries or a Special.
InEver After: A Cinderella Story(1998), a modern,post-feministinterpretation of the Cinderella story[35]alongsideDrew BarrymoreandMelanie Lynskey, Huston appeared as Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent, the new wife of Auguste de Barbarac, a wealthy widower. The film was acclaimed by critics and made a respectable US$98 million globally.[36]Lisa Schwarzbaum fromEntertainment Weeklypraised her performance as a cruel stepmother: "Huston does a lot of eye narrowing and eyebrow raising while toddling around in an extraordinary selection of extreme headgear, accompanied by her two less-than-self-actualized daughters—the snooty, social-climbing, nasty Marguerite, and the dim, lumpy, secretly nice Jacqueline. "Nothing is final until you're dead", Mama instructs her girls at the dinner table, "and even then I'm sure God negotiates."
In 1998, Huston played a woman romantically involved with a compulsive gambler in the neo-noirPhoenix,[37]withRay Liotta, as well as the mother of a troubled man inVincent Gallo's independent dramedyBuffalo '66, which starred Gallo as her son and reunited her withChristina Ricci. The director had difficulties working with his cast and crew, and reportedly did not get along with Huston on set. He claimed she caused the film to be turned down by theCannes Film Festival.[38]
Her next directorial effort, the Irish dramedyAgnes Browne(1999) —in which she also starred as the title character— was released to mixed reviews.The New York Timesreviewer Stephen Holden found it "nothing more than a series of homey skits loosely woven into a portrait of aworking-classsaint."[39]Nevertheless, the film won the Youth Jury Award at the 1999San Sebastián International Film Festivaland received a Grand Prix nomination at the Ghent International Film Festival the same year.[citation needed]Huston appeared as an affluent English woman, alongsideJames Fox,Nick Nolte,Kate Beckinsale, andUma Thurman, inJames Ivory's period dramaThe Golden Bowl(2000), based on the 1904novel of the same namebyHenry James.[40]
InThe Royal Tenenbaums(2001), her first collaboration with directorWes Anderson, Huston took on the role the soft-spoken matriarch of an estranged family of former child prodigies, alongsideGene Hackman,Gwyneth Paltrow,Ben StillerandLuke Wilson. During production, Anderson gave Huston photographs of his mother who, like Etheline, was an archaeologist. Huston said, "Wes would send pictures of his mother in aviator jackets or on archaeological digs, and he very specifically wanted me to wear a certain locket. Finally, I asked him, 'Wes, am I playing your mother?'" Anderson replied this was not the case. Anderson and Huston had a tense relationship with Hackman, who was not always amiable on set.[41]On the first day Hackman and Huston appeared in a scene together, Huston had to slap him, and later said the slap was real and "I hit him a really good one. I saw the imprint of my hand on his cheek and I thought, he's going to kill me."[41]During young Margot's birthday scene in the opening scenes, Huston's hair caught fire from a birthday candle. Anderson creditedKumar Pallanawith extinguishing the blaze before Huston was seriously injured.[41]A positive critical response greetedThe Royal Tenenbaums, which made US$71.4 million worldwide.[42]
In 2001, Huston starred as Viviane,Lady of the Lake, in the TNT miniseriesThe Mists of Avalon, based on the 1983novel of the same titlebyMarion Zimmer Bradley. The production was watched by more than 30 million "unduplicated viewers" during its premiere, making it the highest-rated original movie of the summer on basic cable, and earned Huston nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and aScreen Actors Guild Award. In 2002, she portrayed the doctor of an ex-FBIagent (Clint Eastwood) chasing a sadistic killer (Jeff Daniels) in the thrillerBlood Work, loosely based on the 1998novel of the same namebyMichael Connelly,[43]as well as the longtime client of a man who runs an exclusiveescort serviceinGeorge Hickenlooper's black comedyThe Man from Elysian Fields, withAndy GarciaandMick Jagger. Despite both films' lukewarm critical and commercial responses, Todd McCarthy ofVarietyfelt that her character inElysian Fieldswas "played with invigorating relish" by the actress,[44]while Roger Ebert hailed the film as "one of the best films" of the year.[45]
Daddy Day Care(2003), co-starringEddie Murphy, featured Huston as the ruthless head of an expensive and over-academic preschool.Slant, in a critical review of the film, noted that Huston "brings embarrassing conviction to the role of stuffy day care proprietress ...Daddy Day Careseems to exist solely to sedate a theater-going public's offspring. And while the film's sense of sobriety should do the job, don't expectThe Witches".[46]Nevertheless, the release was a commercial success, grossing over US$160 million worldwide.[47]
In 2004, Huston took on the role ofwomen's suffrageleaderCarrie Chapman Cattin the HBO filmIron Jawed Angels, withHilary Swank,Frances O'ConnorandJulia Ormond. For her role, she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination forOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie, and won theGolden Globeand theSatellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film. InThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou(2004), her second film with Wes Anderson, Huston portrayed the estranged wife of an eccentric oceanographer. Roger Ebert observed that the actress "seems privately amused, which is so much more intriguing than seeming publicly amused", but noted that he "can't recommend [the film], but I would not for one second discourage you from seeing it".[48]As a member of the cast, she garnered nominations for Best Ensemble from theBoston Society of Film Criticsand theCritics' Choice Movie Awards.
Huston filmed her third directorial effort, theHallmark ChanneldramaRiding the Bus with My Sister(2005), inHamilton, Ontario, Canada.[49]It was adapted from the 2002memoirbyRachel Simon, and starredRosie O'DonnellandAndie MacDowell. Unlike the book, the film received negative reviews from critics, who generally criticised the film's "egregious" portrayal ofDown's Syndrome.[50]However, she said: "I think the movie comes from a pretty direct point of view".[51]
In 2006, Huston was featured as an art teacher in the dramedyArt School Confidential, thepresident of the United Statesin the made-for-CBS thrillerCovert One: The Hades Factor, a competing business owner in the comedyMaterial Girls, a vanishing con artist in therevisionist WesternSeraphim Falls, and an ebullient patroness in the romantic dramaThese Foolish Things. ExcludingSeraphim Falls, none of the aforementioned films performed well with critics nor audiences.[52]This changed with her third Wes Anderson film,The Darjeeling Limited(2007), in which Huston starred as the mother of three brothers who becomes a nun and moves to aChristian conventin theHimalayas.Peter Travers, forRolling Stonefound her to be a "dynamite" in the film, which he deemed "the fullest blossoming yet of Anderson's talents as a total filmmaker".[53]
Choke(2008), a black comedy directed byClark Greggand based on the 2001novel of the same namebyChuck Palahniuk, featured Huston as the hospitalized mother of a sex addict inColonial America. Reviews for the film were mixed, butEmpirecritic Philip Wilding wrote: "Huston is magnetic as [the] ailing mother Ida, both as a fading invalid or vibrant and deranged in flashback. She is the hook on which her son hangs his hopes and anxieties". Meanwhile, Roger Ebert felt that her role "resembled the criminal character" she played inThe Grifters(1990).[54]In 2008, Huston also voiced Queen Clarion inTinker Bell, which was released on DVD to outstanding commercial results.[55]She reprised the role infour sequels,a television specialand a short film, all released between 2009 and 2015.[56]
Huston took on significant roles in three 2011 live-action films. The first was that ofMiss Battle-Axe, a strict, sadistic schoolteacher who talks with a Scottish accent, in the 3D children's musical adventure comedyHorrid Henry: The Movie, directed byNick Moore. She found her character to be "irresistible", explaining toThe Guardian: "It's very British material to me, and I've always been strangely attracted to these extreme characters".[57]The film was panned by critics but was a commercial success in the UK.[58]Her second performance of 2011 was that of a mother of a man with a malignant cancerous tumor in the drama50/50, directed byJonathan Levineand co-starringJoseph Gordon-LevittandSeth Rogen. The film was a critical and commercial darling upon its release.[59]David Schmader, writing in theStranger, praised the "stellar" cast and felt that Huston "roars back to prominence with a twisty performance as Adam's barely contained mess of a mom".[60]The unsuccessfulThe Big Year, Huston's last live-action film of 2011, featured her as an "avid birder", who "captains ocean-going expeditions".[61]
Huston starred in theNBCtelevision seriesSmash(2012–2013), as Broadway producer Eileen Rand.[62]After her husband's death in 2008, Huston creditedSmash—her first regular venture into series television— with coming at a "vital time" and finally filling a void in her life.[63]The series aired for two seasons and was the subject of critical acclaim.[64]Huston subsequently appeared in the second and third seasons of theAmazon VideoseriesTransparent, as Vic, a cisgender woman who forms a connection with Maura, a retired college professor of political science atUCLA. In the horror comedyThe Cleanse(2016), Huston played the director of a secretive self-help program, alongsideJohnny Galecki,Anna FrielandOliver Platt.
In 2017, Huston narrated the black comedyThirst Street, and starred withBill Pullmanas siblings feuding over possession of their father's estate in the comedyTrouble. John DeFore ofThe Hollywood Reporterpraised the latter film, on which Huston was an executive producer, writing that "the cast goes a long way here, turningTroubleat times into the kind of small-town hangout film that will please fest auds."[65]Huston played the Director, a heavily bejeweled Russian ballet instructor, and whatVulturedescribed as a "small but memorable role", inJohn Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum(2019),[10]which made US$326 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics.[66]
