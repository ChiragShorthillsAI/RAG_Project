In a 2004 interview withThe Independent, Thornton explained,
It's just that I won't use real silver. You know, like the big, old, heavy-ass forks and knives, I can't do that. It's the same thing as the antique furniture. I just don't like old stuff. I'm creeped out by it, and I have no explanation why ... I don't have a phobia about American antiques, it's mostly French—you know, like the big, old, gold-carved chairs with the velvet cushions. TheLouis XIV type. That's what creeps me out. I can spot the imitation antiques a mile off. They have a different vibe. Not as much dust.[81]
Thornton is a baseball fan, particularly theSt. Louis Cardinals.

Asked about faith, Thornton said "I’m not what you’d call a traditional religious person. We went to the Methodist church—every Sunday you put on your little creepy suit with your clip-on tie and went to church. But it wasn’t like I paid any attention. Hardcore Christians and atheists—they both say they know exactly what the deal is. Anybody who says, 'I know what happens,' I don't believe them. That's kind of my religion."[77]

Mickey and Mallory are a Bonnie and Clyde for the '90s, Stone's '90s; they're damaged goods — haunted, horny and out for blood.Harrelsonand Lewis ... play the dysfunctional hell out of them ...

Her portrayal of Kelly in the latter was particularly well received,[89]withThe New York Timescommenting that it "crackle[s] with authenticity", adding:
The distance between riot grrrl and suburban mom is quite a stretch. But as middle age approaches, time has a way of landing mouthy young rebels in roles they never expected to inhabit. Take Juliette Lewis, the personification of scary defiance [in]Natural Born Killers... InKelly & Cal, [she] conveys the excruciating discomfort of a slightly crumpled former upstart struggling to adapt to a staid, middle-class existence. That means reining in the anarchic impulses of her youth and tolerating polite, buttoned-up in-laws.[90]
Lewis' next role was inJem and the Holograms(2015), an adaptation of the 1980s animated seriesJem,[91]where she played a music producer.

Natalie is nothing like myself. But because there's certain things, like 'tough' and 'wrong side of the tracks' or whatever, people think it's something I've played before, but I haven't. [It has taken] me like 30 years for people to go, 'Wow, she does unpredictable stuff, and it's high quality'".[111]During that same period, Lewis appeared as Judy onPeacock's reboot ofQueer as Folk(2022) and co-starred in the biographical Hulu miniseriesWelcome to Chippendales(also 2022).Richard Roepercalled the latter "colorful and shiny but increasingly dark and twisted" in his review for theChicago Sun-Times, adding that Lewis' portrayal of forthright costume designer Denise Coughlan was "outstanding".[112]

I think there's so much confusion because people don't understand a religion where you can be another religion but you can still practice Scientology".[118]In an interview withTimein 2015, Lewis remarked about protecting her freedom of choice and religion, and being annoyed at people's misconceptions about Scientology: "Whatever people's conceptions are of me, I think it's cute. I roll with it".[119]By 2021, she began to distance herself from Scientology, tellingThe New York TimesandThe Washington Postthat she is aspiritualistand does not identify as a Scientologist.[120][121]
Lewis married professional skateboarderSteve Berrain September 1999.[122]She filed for divorce in April 2003.[123]Lewis described the divorce as "amicable",[123]later commenting, "Steve would be the first to admit he was a workaholic. You have to be ready to have a partnership. And sometimes you're like, 'Whoa, this is too much. I only actually have enough steam to focus on my own thing'".[32]
Lewis has supportedLittle Kids Rock, an American nonprofit organization that works to restore and revitalize music education in disadvantaged U.S. public schools, by painting aFender Stratocasterguitar and donating it to an auction to raise money for the organization.[124]
