Serenityis a 2019 Americanmystery thriller filmwritten, produced and directed bySteven Knight.[4]The film starsMatthew McConaughey,Anne Hathaway,Diane Lane,Jason Clarke,Djimon Hounsou, andJeremy Strong, and follows a fishing boat captain who is approached by his ex-wife to murder her abusive new husband. First announced in January 2017, principal photography on the film began inMauritiusthat July.
Serenitywas released in the United States on January 25, 2019, byAviron Pictures.[5]Following poor test screenings, its distributor abruptly dropped its marketing efforts and the film was a critical and commercial failure.
Baker Dill is a fishing boat captain living a quiet and sheltered life. He spends his days leading tours off a tranquil, tropical enclave called Plymouth Island and is obsessed with catching an evasive giantyellowfin tunawhom he calls "Justice."
One day, Dill's ex-wife Karen tracks him down and begs him to save her and their young son, Patrick, from her new, powerful but violently abusive, husband  Frank. She offers Dill $10 million to murder him by throwing him overboard. She tells him that Frank will be arriving later in the week and that they have booked Dill for a fishing trip, the perfect opportunity for Dill to kill Frank.
Torn between his conscience and his desire to help Karen, Dill is thrust back into a life he had tried to forget, as his world is plunged into a new reality that may not be all that it seems.
It soon becomes apparent that Dill is a character in a computer game Patrick created, based on his father, John Mason, a U.S. Marine Corps Captain who was killed inIraqin 2006. Patrick had based the character on a memory of his father taking him fishing when he was three years old. When the widowed Karen remarried, Patrick introduced his mother and abusive step-father as new characters in the game, and changed Dill's task from catching tuna to murdering his step-father.
Dill soon begins to realize that he and the other inhabitants of Plymouth Island are merelyartificial intelligencecharacters created by his son. Nevertheless, he decides to go along with the objective of killing Frank.
As Dill carries out the objective, Patrick summons up the courage to confront Frank in real life and stabs him in the chest with a knife that belonged to his father. Frank dies and Patrick is charged with murder, but he is released into his mother's custody while awaiting trial. He designs a new computer game in which he and his father are reunited.
Hathaway stated she was attracted to playing Karen because the character puts up a "mask" defined by the "male gaze", and also that she was not usually asked to play these kinds of characters.[6]
On January 28, 2017, it was announced thatMatthew McConaugheyandAnne Hathawaywould star in a "sexy noir" film,Serenity,which would be directed bySteven Knightfrom his own script.Greg Shapiroand Guy Heeley would produce the film throughIM Global, which also financed.[7]The production received a local government rebate of 30 percent.[8]McConaughey and Hathaway hadn't acted together sinceInterstellar.[9]On April 18,Jason Clarkejoined the film to play Hathaway's character's wealthy, abusive husband.[10]On May 10, 2017, more cast were announced, includingUma Thurmanto play McConaughey's character's love interest (although Thurman soon removed herself from the production due to scheduling conflicts), andDjimon Hounsoufor an unspecified role.[11]By July 2017, confirmed cast included McConaughey, Hathaway, Clarke, Hounsou,Diane Lane(replacing Thurman), andJeremy Strong.[12][13]
Principal photographyon the film began late-July 2017 inMauritius.[12][13]The film's production caused a scandal in the country, as Prime MinisterPravind Jugnauthwas accused of having misappropriated funds in excess of 200 million Mauritian rupees (~$6 million USD) to support the film.[14]
In February 2018,Aviron Picturesacquired distribution rights to the film.[15]The film was originally scheduled to be released on September 28, 2018,[16]but was later pushed back to October 19, 2018, and then again to its actual release date: January 25, 2019.[17]It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 30, 2019.[2]
Following poor test screenings, the movie's distributor Aviron reportedly ceased its promotion and advertisement efforts. This came even after the film's stars agreed to a full campaign "including a junket and as many late-night and daytime talk shows as would have them."[18]According toDeadline Hollywood, "maybe only nine spots aired in obscure locales and not in any time slots that would have helped create awareness for the film," and that the film's stars and director were misled about the amount of junket and late night interviews they would be able to participate in to promote the film. In response, Aviron said in a statement: "As much as we love this film and still hope it finds its audience, we tested and retested the film—with audiences and critics alike—and sadly, the data demonstrated that the film was not going to be able to perform at our initial expectations, so we adjusted our budget and marketing tactics accordingly."[19]Some of the film's stars, such as McConaughey and Hathaway, were reportedly upset because Aviron pledged to put up a promotion and advertising campaign commensurate with a 2500-screen release.[19]
Scott Mendelson, a writer forForbes, defended Aviron's decision, stating "an original, R-rated, star-driven, sexually-explicit thriller from a small distributor, with poor reviews, a D+ from Cinemascore and (understandably) misleading marketing is the very definition ofDOA", concluding, "Aviron would merely have been burning money to spend any more on marketingSerenitythan they already did".[20]
Serenitygrossed $8.5 million in the United States and Canada,[3]and $5.8 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $14.4 million, plus $1.4 million with home video sales, against a production budget of $25 million.[2]
In the United States and Canada,Serenitywas released alongsideThe Kid Who Would Be King, and was initially projected to gross around $7 million from 2,561 theaters in its opening weekend.[21]The film made $1.6 million on its first day, including $250,000 from Thursday night previews, lowering estimates to $4 million. It ended up debuting to $4.4 million, finishing eighth, and marking the worstwide releaseopening of Hathaway's career.[22]In its second weekend, the film fell 62% to $1.7 million, finishing 14th.[23]
On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 21% based on 199 reviews, and an average rating of 4.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A high-concept mystery with a twist,Serenityisn't what it appears to be at first—unfortunately, it's also not anywhere near as clever or entertaining as it thinks."[24]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[25]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "D+" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an  overall positive score of 56% and a recommend rating of 34%.[22]
Christy Lemire ofRogerEbert.comgave the film one star, calling it "terrible and insane" and writing: "Similar toCollateral BeautyandThe Book of Henry—recent dramas with esteemed casts that went off the rails in enjoyably awful ways—Serenityis the kind of bonkers movie that truly must be seen to be believed".[26]The Hollywood Reporter'sTodd McCarthywrote, "Actors can usually have fun with such melodramatic roles, but Knight's stratagems serve to straitjacket the cast more than liberate it to diminishing returns as the climax remains an elusive vision on the horizon. Like a long fishing day without a bite,Serenityinvites impatience rather than excited anticipation, and the eventual payoff provokes a big 'huh?'"[5]Several reviewers, includingVanity FairandThe Independent, criticized theplot twist.[27][28]
In his review forThe New York Observer,Rex Reedstated that "The new year is not even a month old, but a hunk of junk calledSerenityalready qualifies as the worst film of 2019" and that "[a]t the critics' screening I attended, the audience was reduced to hysterics".[29]Michael O'Sullivan ofThe Washington Postwrote that "[t]he dialogue is bad, to the point of self-parody... The performances are cartoonish, especially that of Hathaway, whosefemme fatalecomes across as a kind of live-actionJessica RabbitfromWho Framed Roger Rabbit. And the scenario abounds withclichéand lazy shorthand."[5]This view was shared by theNew Yorkerreview, which cited the film as a mere collection of cliches that were assembled as ameta movie.[30]InRolling Stone,Peter TraversdefinedSerenity"like the bastard child ofBody HeatandThe Sixth Sense, minus the heat and the sense."[31]
The movie ended up on several lists of worst movies of 2019, includingHollywood Reporter,The A.V. Club,Variety, andCBS News.[32][33][34][35]
The film was nominated for twoGolden Raspberry Awards, Matthew McConaughey forWorst Actorand 
Anne Hathaway forWorst Actress(also forThe Hustle).[36]
