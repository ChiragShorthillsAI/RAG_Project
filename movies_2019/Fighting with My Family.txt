Fighting with My Familyis a 2019biographicalsportscomedy-dramafilm written and directed byStephen Merchant. Based on the 2012 documentaryThe Wrestlers: Fighting with My Familyby Max Fisher, it depicts the career of Englishprofessional wrestlerPaigeas she makes her way toWWE, while also following her brotherZak Zodiac, as he struggles with his failure to achieve similar success.Florence PughandJack Lowdenstar as Paige and Zodiac respectively, alongsideLena Headey,Nick Frost,Vince Vaughn, andDwayne Johnson, with the latter also acting as producer.
The film premiered at theSundance Film Festivalon 28 January 2019 and was theatrically released in the United States on 14 February 2019. It received positive reviews from critics, particularly for Merchant's directing and the performances of Pugh and Vaughn. The film grossed $41.5 million worldwide.
WrestlersRickandJulia Knightraise their children,SarayaandZak, to follow in their footsteps; as young adults, the siblings apply to join theWWE, and are evaluated by veteran trainer Hutch Morgan, who agrees to let them try out before aSmackDowntaping at TheO2 Arena, where they meet WWE legendDwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Shortly before her tryout, Saraya adopts the stage name "Paige", after her favorite character on the TV showCharmed.
Morgan chooses Paige to train for the WWE, but not Zak, despite Paige's protests. Morgan forces Zak to return home after making it clear he will never be signed to the WWE, leaving Paige with no one to stick up for her. Arriving atNXTinFlorida, Paige has difficulty with the training, especially given that her fellow trainees are mostly models and cheerleaders who have no wrestling experience and thus make poor training partners. Paige also struggles with performing choreographed promos as they clash with her own natural instincts, and suffers from Morgan's constant belittlement of her mistakes.
During her WWE debut at an NXT live event, Paige is heckled by the crowd and freezes, leaving the ring in tears. She tries bleaching her dark hair and gets a spray tan in a desperate attempt to fit in with her peers. After failing an obstacle course, Paige lashes out at the other trainees for gossiping about her when they weren't. A sympathetic Morgan then reveals to Paige the real reason he didn't let Zak sign up: the league would have forced him to work as ajobber, which would have ruined his health. Morgan implies that a similar experience forced him to give up on his own wrestling career.
Believing that professional wrestling isn't worth it and that she'd have a much happier life helping her parents train other wrestlers, Paige decides to quit the WWE and return to her hometown ofNorwich. She travels home for the Christmas break to inform her family of her decision. Angry that she is giving up on the dream that he failed to achieve, Zak attacks Paige during a wrestling match and then gets in a drunken bar fight. Paige changes her mind after Zak berates her for giving up, and she returns to Florida to rejoin the WWE. She reasserts her individuality by re-adopting her original hair colour and skin tone, rapidly improves in training, and befriends and encourages many of her fellow trainees.
Morgan brings the trainees toWrestleMania XXX, where The Rock greets Paige and tells her she will make herRawdebut the following night against the currentWWE Divas Champion,AJ Lee. Paige makes her Raw debut, where she again freezes and takes a severe beating from Lee before finally turning the tables and beating the champion. Claiming Lee's title for herself, she proudly declares "this is MY house now!" as her family and friends cheer her victory back home.
Additionally,WWEwrestlersBig Show,SheamusandThe Mizmake appearances as themselves, while an uncredited actor playedJohn Cena.Michael Cole,Jerry Lawler, andJohn "Bradshaw" Layfieldprovide commentary on the Paige vs. AJ Lee match, whileJim Rossprovided commentary on The Rock's match. Several other WWE wrestlers (including Cena himself), as well as the real Knight family, appear inarchival footagethroughout the film whileZak Zodiachimself appears in a cameo as a gang lieutenant.
On 7 February 2017,The Hollywood Reporterreported thatDwayne JohnsonandStephen Merchanthad teamed withWWE StudiosandFilm4to produce a film based on the life ofSaraya "Paige" Bevis, a professional wrestler with theWWE.[4]Merchant would write and direct the film, while Johnson wouldcameoin the film and executive produce. In the days after the announcement, the main cast was revealed:Florence Pughas Saraya,[5]Jack Lowdenas Saraya's brother Zak, andLena HeadeyandNick Frostas their parents.[6]Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Picturesacquired the distribution rights on 10 February for US$17.5 million.[7]On 14 February, Johnson announced thatVince Vaughnhad been cast, and filming would commence the following day.[8][9]In-ring scenes were filmed afterWWE Rawon 20 February at theStaples CenterinLos Angeles.[10][11]Filming also took place around Bracknell, Berkshire, specifically the Harmans Water area, also in and aroundNorwich,Norfolk,England, with locations around the city used in the film, as well as the seaside town ofGreat Yarmouth,[12][13]and atPinewood Studios.[14]Scenes that depicted Paige training with NXT in Florida were shot inOrlando, FloridaandLong Beach, California.[15]
Like many biographical films, the film took several liberties with Paige's journey with WWE. The film had her start her WWE career performing for NXT when she actually first performed inFlorida Championship Wrestling, Paige's time in NXT was kept minimal with no mention of her reign asNXT Women's Champion, and several characters were fictional, including Hutch Morgan. Additionally, Paige had previously failed a WWE tryout before being successful in another. Johnson himself never met Paige (or any of the Bevis/Knight family) until seeing the original documentary in 2012, unlike the film's fictionalized portrayal of Johnson meeting Paige and Zak backstage at a WWE event in England; Johnson himself had just returned to WWE in 2011 after a seven-year absence when Paige signed with WWE in April 2011.[16]

"I don't remember where I got this grand idea that I could somehow beJohn Cleese. That was my overriding passion from my mid-teens. John Cleese had grown up inWeston-super-Mare, not far from Bristol, where I grew up, and he was tall and he was very funny and very British and it's almost like I thought, 'Well if they want tall people from theWest Country, I can do that.'"
Stephen James Merchant was born in theHanhamsuburb ofBristol[2]on 24 November 1974,[3]the son of nursery nurse Jane Elaine (née Hibbs) and plumber and builder Ronald John Merchant.[4]He attendedHanham Secondary School[5]and later theUniversity of WarwickinCoventryfrom 1993 to 1996, where he graduated with aBAin Film and Literature with a2:1.[6]He worked as a film reviewer on the student radio stationRadio Warwick, where he began his broadcasting career.[7]His group there included film criticJames King. A number of tapes ofThe Steve Showwere rediscovered and have been published on various Merchant fan sites.[8]
Merchant was inspired to get into comedy byJohn Cleese.[1]In 2019, he said that he had never met Cleese, but that his parents had recently met him on a cruise and asked him to sign a book for Merchant; they also recorded a voicemail message on the phone in their cabin, which consisted of Cleese saying: "Hello there, Mr and Mrs Merchant, I'd be more than happy to sign your book. I was just wondering is your Stephen Merchant the same Stephen Merchant who collaborated withRicky GervaisonThe Office? Because I'm an enormous fan and please pass on my best regards." On hearing this, Merchant said, "I don't feel I need to meet him now. That's all I needed."[9]
Merchant began his career performing stand-up comedy at Bristol's Comedy Box, where, he recalled: "The first week I did really well. The second week I died on my arse. I realised that stand-up was not that easy after all."[10]He also appeared as a contestant on a 1997 episode of the TV game showBlockbusters[11]and worked for a short time as a DJ forRadio Caroline.[3]
Merchant metRicky Gervaisfor the first time in 1997 when Gervais (in the position Head of Speech at the radio stationXFM London), hired Merchant as his assistant.[12]Gervais later said that he had called Merchant for an interview because it was the firstCVhanded to him. Merchant and Gervais hosted a Saturday afternoon radio show together from January  to August 1998, when both of them left XFM as it was bought by theCapital Radio Group. In the same year, Merchant was a finalist atThe Daily TelegraphOpen Mic Awards.[13]
Merchant worked for seven months at XFM 104.9. The Saturday show never had a large audience. Gervais said: "It's a tinpot radio station... It's not even the biggest radio station in the building." He created the features 'Hip Hop Hooray', 'Make Ricky Gervais Laugh' and 'Song for the Ladies'. After leaving XFM, Merchant began a production course at the BBC. As part of his coursework, he enlisted Gervais to perform in a 30-minute short film, "Seedy Boss", which became the earliest inspiration for their mock documentaryThe Office.[14]They collaborated on a sitcom pilot calledGolden Yearsfeaturing a manager suffering a mid-life crisis. It aired on Channel 4'sComedy Labseries in September 1998,[15]but the show failed to find further success.
In mid-2001,BBC Twoaired the first series ofThe Office, co-written and co-directed by Merchant and Gervais and starring the latter as paper sales office managerDavid Brent; the show initially received low ratings. Beginning in September 2001, Merchant and Gervais returned to XFM as co-hosts ofThe Ricky Gervais Show, another Saturday afternoon programme, which led to their fruitful relationship with producerKarl Pilkington.[12]
They took a break from the radio show in mid-2002 in order to film the second series ofThe Office, which aired that year; in addition to writing and directing the show, Merchant made a cameo performance in the episode "Charity" as a friend ofGareth Keenan's character and known by the name Oggy or Oggmonster. Merchant's father also appeared in multiple episodes as an officehandymannamed Gordon. Merchant also directed a sitcom pilot calledThe Last Chancers, which aired onComedy Labin November 2002 and became a five-part series broadcast in December onE4.[16]

Terry and I talked about how her instincts are almost animalistic and she can see 360 degrees around her. She is aware of what is going on. That is how she is grounded. She is of the earth".[20]The Brothers Grimmreceived mixed reviews and made US$105.3 million worldwide.[21][22]
