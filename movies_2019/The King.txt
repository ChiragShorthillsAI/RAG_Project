The Kingis a 2019epichistorical dramafilm directed byDavid Michôd, based on several plays fromWilliam Shakespeare'sHenriad.[3][4][5]The screenplay was written by Michôd andJoel Edgerton, who both produced the film withBrad Pitt,Dede Gardner,Jeremy Kleiner, andLiz Watts.The Kingincludes an ensemble cast led byTimothée Chalametas the Prince of Wales and later KingHenry V of England, alongside Edgerton,Sean Harris,Lily-Rose Depp,Robert Pattinson, andBen Mendelsohn.
The film focuses on the rise of Henry V as king after his father dies as he also must navigate palace politics, the war his father left behind, and the emotional strings of his past life.The Kingpremiered at the76th Venice International Film Festivalon 2 September 2019, and was released digitally viaNetflixon 11 October 2019. The film received generally favourable reviews from film critics but, despite being openly presented as an adaptation of Shakespeare's Henriad adaptation rather than as a historicaldocumentary film, it was criticised by historians for its inaccuracy to both the original plays and historical reality.
KingHenry IV of Englandhas several sons, including the eldest,Henry, Prince of Wales("Hal"), andThomas. Hal, uninterested in succeeding his father, spends his days drinking, whoring, and jesting with his companionFalstaffinEastcheap.
King Henry IV grows tired of Hal's debauchery and announces that Thomas will inherit the throne. King Henry IV sends Thomas to subdueHotspur's rebellion. However, Hal arrives and upstages Thomas by challenging Hotspur tosingle combat. Hal kills Hotspur, ending the battle without further conflict.
Thomas, feeling cheated of his glory, complains to King Henry IV. Thomas dies shortly after while campaigning against the rebels inWales. King Henry IV dies in his bed with Hal present. Hal is anointed as King Henry V and opts for peace and conciliation with his father's many adversaries, despite his actions being seen as weakness.
At King Henry V's coronation feast, envoys from theDauphin of Francepresent Hal with atennisball as an insulting coronation gift. However, King Henry V frames this as a positive reflection of his boyhood. His sisterPhilippa, now the Queen ofDenmark, cautions her brother that nobles in any royal court have their own interests in mind and will never fully reveal their true intentions.
King Henry V interrogates a captured assassin who claims to have been sent to kill him byKing Charles VIof France.French agentsapproach the English noblesCambridgeandGrey. The traitors plot against Hal and unsuccessfully attempt to win over the Chief Justice,Gascoigne. Gascoigne advises Hal that a show of strength is necessary to uniteEngland, so Hal declares war onFranceand has Cambridge and Grey beheaded. He approaches Falstaff and appoints him as his chief military strategist, saying that Falstaff is the only man he truly trusts.
The English army sets sail for France. After completing theSiege of Harfleur, they receive taunting messages from the Dauphin. The English advance parties stumble upon a vast French army gathering to face them.Dorsetadvises Hal to retreat, but Falstaff proposes a false advance to induce the French into rushing forward into the muddy battlefield, where they will be weighed down by their heavy armour and horses. They will then be attacked by theEnglish longbowmenand surrounded by a large, lightly armoured flanking force hidden in the nearby woods.
Unable to dissuade Falstaff from leading the advance, Hal challenges the Dauphin to single combat to minimize bloodshed. The Dauphin sees this as weakness and refuses, as theBattle of Agincourtbegins. Falstaff's plan succeeds; the French army charges and gets stuck in the mud. Hal leads a flanking attack, and the outnumbered yet agile English army defeats the stalled French, although Falstaff is killed. The Dauphin, witnessing his men's retreat, restates Hal's challenge but slips in the mud until Hal orders his soldiers to kill him. Hal commands the execution of all French prisoners to prevent regrouping, despite Falstaff's warning against this unchivalrous act unworthy of a king.
Hal meets King Charles VI, who agrees to adopt him as his heir and offers him his daughter,Catherine of Valois. Hal returns to England with his new wife for a triumphant celebration. In private, she challenges his reasons for invading France and denies the alleged French actions against him, suggesting that the assassin was a plot from within his own court. Suspicious, Hal confronts Gascoigne, who admits that he staged the insult and acts of aggression, believing his sole duty is to protect the king, even if it requires deceiving him. In a cold fury, Hal kills the Chief Justice and returns to Catherine, asking her to promise to always speak the truth to him as clearly as possible.
In addition,Thibault de Montalemberthas a cameo as France'sKing Charles VI.

The film's original score was composed byNicholas Britell, who thought of approaching the film's music from the 21st century, instead of the medieval 15th century approach, saying "because of the timelessness of these issues, if felt like something that we could explore with the sound of different time periods, just to make you look at the early 1400's in a way that it felt like you hadn't seen it before". He felt that the "1400s looks like it was a foreign planet".[19][20]He experimented the film's music using bass clarinets run with tape filters, and sounds of metal while composing.[21]It was Britell's most "dark and sombre" music reflecting the zone of the film.[22]Lakeshore Recordsreleased the album consisting of 15 tracks from Britell's score, on 1 November 2019 in digital and CD formats, while the vinyl edition was released three years later on 8 July 2022.[21]

Rather than a historicaldocumentary film,The Kingis a 21st century adaptation, ofWilliam Shakespeare's 16th centuryHenriadfictionalised adaptations, of 15th century events; asThe Independentopined, "as an adaptation of an adaptation, a few things are bound to have been lost in translation".[34]After its release,The Kingbecame the subject of widespread commentary over itshistorical accuracy. The film, based on theHenriad, a collection ofShakespearean history playsabout themonarchs of England, includes several fictional characters (such asJohn Falstaff) and contains several historical dramatisations of the real events the movie was based on.[35]
