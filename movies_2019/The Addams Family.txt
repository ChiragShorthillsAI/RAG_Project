A sequel,The Addams Family 2, was released on October 1, 2021.
An angry mob of villagers that rejects anything macabre in nature disrupts the midnight wedding ceremony ofGomez AddamsandMorticia Frumpand drives them away with the rest of the Addams clan. During the chaos,GrandmamabuysUncle Festertime to evacuate Gomez, Morticia, andThing. Gomez and Morticia decide to move toNew Jersey, a place "no one would be caught dead in." There, Gomez, Morticia, and Thing find their "perfect" home in an abandoned asylum on a hill. They meetLurch, an escaped mental patient whom they hit when Thing was driving their car, and immediately recruit him as their butler.
13 years later, the Addams family continue to live their gloomy lives in isolation from the outside world. Gomez prepares his sonPugsleyfor his upcoming "SabreMazurka", a rite of passage that every Addams family member takes. Morticia struggles to keep their daughter,Wednesday, from wanting to experience the world outside the mansion after a balloon and confetti appear on their property.
Elsewhere, reality TV host Margaux Needler, who is building a perfectplanned communitycalled "Assimilation" so her show will have a successful season finale, discovers the Addams family's household and becomes determined to rid the town of it when the family refuses to change, starting with spreading rumors about the Addamses through social media, claiming that they are freaks. Wednesday then meets Margaux's neglected daughter Parker and persuades Morticia to let her attend junior high school. Pugsley struggles with the complicated traditions and pressure of his Mazurka, even with the guidance of Gomez and Uncle Fester. Grandmama arrives at the house for the event.
At school, Wednesday stands up for Parker and her twin friends Layla and Kayla from the school's bully Bethany and befriends them after she resurrects somedead frogsand commands them to attack Bethany. Later on, the two discuss their frustrations and change their dressing habits – Parker becomes moregothicand Wednesday dresses more colorfully – to the shock of both of their mothers, with Margaux vowing to destroy the Addamses and Wednesday grounded by Morticia. After an argument with Morticia, Wednesday decides to run away in secret and stay with Parker for a while, which Pugsley inadvertently tells Morticia.
AsCousin Ittarrives at the Addams household, Wednesday and Parker discover a secret room under Parker's house and that Margaux has planted hidden cameras in every house she designed in town. Margaux catches the two and locks them in the attic, but Wednesday breaks them out. Margaux rallies the townsfolk to attack the mansion just as the entire Addams clan arrive for Pugsley's Mazurka.
During the Mazurka, Pugsley fails in front of the whole family, but Gomez admits he forgot to let him be who he is. The mob arrives flinging boulders, severely damaging the mansion and trapping the family inside. Pugsley uses his love of bombs and destruction to defend his family and manages to destroy the mob'strebuchet. Wednesday and Parker join in and help everyone out of the wreckage safely with help of the living tree Ichabod.
Assimilation's civilians realize that the Addamses are not monsters, but a family, as Wednesday and Parker state that everyone is weird in their own unique way, revealing also Margaux's spying on the civilians, who are violated upon hearing this. Margaux gets her comeuppance when her true nature is then exposed during a subsequent tirade against the civilians  — demanding they do as she says or be kicked out of town — thanks to Parker live-streaming it on her phone, after which Margaux's agent Glenn informs her their network has cancelled her show because of the bad publicity. As Fester comes up with a compromise for Margaux, Assimilation's civilians offer to make amends with the Addamses.
After they work together to rebuild the mansion, the Addams family and Assimilation's civilians live in peace. Margaux becomes Fester's business partner, selling homes to the other members of the Addams clan, and Pugsley is hailed as an Addams for his defending of the clan.
