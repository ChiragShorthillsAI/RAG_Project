In 2013,CBS Filmsacquired the rights to the book series from 1212 Entertainment,[7]with the intent of producing it as a feature film. By January 2016, it was announced that del Toro would develop and potentially direct the project for CBS Films.

Scary Stories to Tell in the Darkwas theatrically released on August 9, 2019, in the United States byLionsgate Films. The film was well received by critics with praise for its depictions of the horror features from its source material, and went on to gross $105 million at the box office, becoming a financial success. A sequel is in development.
OnHalloweenNight in 1968, in the fictionalPennsylvaniatown of Mill Valley, teenagers Stella, Auggie and Chuck visit the supposedly haunted home of the Bellows family, accompanied by newcomer Ramón. Inside a secret room, they find a book of horror stories written by Sarah Bellows, the family's daughter. Ostracized for heralbinismand accused of witchcraft when the town's children began to die mysteriously, she allegedly committedsuicidein 1898. The local bully, Tommy, locks the group inside Sarah's room along with Ruth, Chuck's sister. After Tommy leaves, the lock is mysteriously opened, and Stella takes Sarah's storybook home.
Back home, Stella finds a new story called "Harold," written in blood, on previously blank pages. In a nearby cornfield, an inebriated Tommy is stalked by the titular Harold—his family's scarecrow. Harold stabs Tommy in the back with a pitchfork, causing him to vomit hay and undergo a violent transformation. The next day, Tommy is reported missing. Stella and Ramon find Harold dressed in Tommy's clothes.
Stella and Ramón watch in shock as a story titled "The Big Toe" writes itself in the storybook. Auggie, the protagonist of the story, unknowingly eats stew containing the big toe of a corpse. Auggie is then dragged under his bed by the corpse and disappears. Alarmed, the remaining friends try fruitlessly to destroy the book. Researching the Bellows, they learn that the live-in maid Sylvia Baptiste was fired after teaching Sarah witchcraft, and the rest of the family all disappeared after Sarah's suicide. However, all their names can be found in the stories, suggesting the book—or Sarah—killed them.
Another new story called "The Red Spot" appears with Ruth as protagonist. Ruth is getting her makeup ready for the play, and starts poking at a swollenspider biteon her cheek. The bite explodes into hundreds of tiny spiders. Ruth is rescued but is traumatized and institutionalized.
The group's investigation takes them to the elderly Lou-Lou Baptiste, Sylvia Baptiste's daughter. They learn that Sarah did not die in the Bellows' house. Instead, she hanged herself in the hospital where her older brother, Dr. Ephraim Bellows, was her supervising doctor.
At the hospital, the group discover recordings that reveal Sarah's brother had ruthlessly performedelectroshock therapyon her to get her to confess to killing the children. Their deaths were actually caused by the family's paper mill poisoning the town's water withmercury, so they framed Sarah when the town got suspicious. Chuck, while trying to evade hospital security, accidentally triggers an alarm which floods the hallways in the same red light from his nightmares. In the recording, Sarah begins to narrate a new story called "The Red Room", with Chuck as the main character. Chuck is then attacked and cornered by the Pale Lady, a phantom from his nightmares, who absorbs him.
Stella and Ramón are arrested for trespassing by Police Chief Turner, who reveals that Ramón is aVietnam Wardraft dodger. Ramón reveals his brother enlisted and his dead body was returned to them in pieces. The book starts a new story called "Me Tie Dough-ty Walker". A head falls down the chimney and more body parts follow. Ramón realizes that the next creature is called the Jangly Man, a monster that frightened him as a child. The Jangly Man kills Turner while Ramón and Stella flee to the Bellows' house for answers. Stella is taken back in time while Ramón tries to evade the Jangly Man. Living out Sarah's experience of abuse, Stella promises Sarah that she will tell the truth of her innocence if she stops harming people. Stella writes down the true story with her blood, and Sarah and all of her monsters vanish.
Stella writes the truth about Sarah's life in the papers, keeping her promise. While Stella receives acclaim for the story, not everyone believes her. Ramón accepts his enlistment and shares an emotional goodbye with Stella before he leaves for the war. With Ruth having recovered, Stella starts looking for a way to rescue Chuck and Auggie.

In July 2019, atSan Diego Comic-Con, del Toro explained whyScary Stories to Tell in the Darkwas not produced as ananthology film:
When we started talking about this about five years ago, I had to think about it... Anthology films are always as bad as the worst story in them – they're never as good as the best story... I remembered inPan's Labyrinth, I created a book called theBook of Crossroads. I thought it could be great if we had a book that reads you, and it writes what you're most afraid of. Then the theme became stories we tell each other.[20][21]
The film features an original score by composersMarco Beltramiand Anna Drubich.[22]In addition to the original music, period songs from the 60s are heard in the film, such as "Season of the Witch" byDonovan, which plays during the film's opening.[23]
A cover of "Season of the Witch" by musicianLana Del Reyis heard in the closing credits to the film and was featured in a trailer for the film.  While talking about his choice to have Del Rey sing the cover for the film, del Toro stated, "I have admired Lana's music for a while now and felt in my gut that she would run with 'Season of the Witch' – that she would use her alchemy to transform it. She is a great artist and has been an amazing partner with us in this adventure. It is an honor for me to have met her."[24]Del Rey's version of the song was released for digital download and streaming on August 9, the same day as the film's premiere.  Mirko Parlevliet of Vital Thrills praised the pairing of Del Rey's sound and the film's vintage aesthetic.[25]Savannah Sicurella ofPastestated, "Del Rey managed to capture the prickly, macabre feeling of the popular Alvin Schwartz stories on which the film was based."[26]
The first footage of the film premiered duringSuper Bowl LIII.[27]The first trailer was released on March 28, 2019, and the second on June 3, 2019. On August 5, 2019, a third trailer was released, featuring a cover version of the Donovan song "Season of the Witch", by Lana Del Rey, performed for the film's soundtrack.[28]All-in-all, the studio spent over $20 million promoting the film.[4]

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77% based on 234 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Like the bestselling series of books that inspired it,Scary Stories to Tell in the Darkopens a creepy gateway into horror for younger genre enthusiasts."[35]Metacriticgave the film a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating "generally favorable  reviews".[36]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "C" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an average 3 out of 5 stars and a 53% "definite recommend".[4]
Owen GleibermanofVarietywrote that "the movie faithfully re-creates the peak moments of half a dozen of Schwartz' most popular stories," but "doesn't totally embrace theGammellvision," referring to the infamy of the illustrations in the original book series.[37]Ben Kenigsberg ofThe New York Timescalled the film "an agreeable bit of fan service."[38]
Keith Uhlich ofThe Hollywood Reporterconversely termed it a "lackluster adaptation", adding that the monsters depicted in the film are "scary", though "they'd be much more so if they felt less like franchisableIPand more like fervent expressions of the ills of the eras on which the film aims to comment."[39]William Bibbiani ofBloody Disgustingwrote that the film "often works very well for several, breathless minutes at a time. But in between those excellent scares there's a lot of filler, a lot of perfunctory plotting and a lot of mediocre character development."[40]Alan Jacques ofLimerick Postgave the film two points out of five and stated "This movie is definitely not meant for a pre-teen audience. There are one or two genuinely creepy moments that would leave your precious nippers sleeping with the lights on until they finish college.... For a young audience coming to horror for the first time, this isn't a bad place to start, but for anyone with a real appreciation of the genre this might feel rather dull and unoriginal."[41]In his review forThe Verge, Noah Berlatsky stated "...Scary Storiesis remarkably insightful and sober in its assessment of the way stories control people, rather than the other way around. Quentin Tarantino'sOnce Upon a Time in Hollywoodwas supposed to be the summer's virtuoso meta-fiction, but its rewritten happy ending, musing on the impotence of writing, seems a lot less bleak thanScary Stories'acknowledgment that some scripts will take you far away where you'll never be seen again."[42]
Tomris Laffly ofRogerEbert.comgave the film three stars out of four, stating "Still,Scary Storiesis a strangely uplifting throwback to old-fashioned clans of investigative teens. While it doesn't break any new ground, there is plenty of vintage fun to be had with kids who feel their way through life's impending fears and live to tell the tale."[43]Writing forThe Guardian, Simran Hans gave the film three stars out of five, noting "Producer and co-writer Guillermo del Toro brings Alvin Schwartz's much-loved children's book series to the big screen, but this uneven film can't decide who it's trying to scare."[44]The New Yorker's Richard Brody mentioned "There's authentic charm to the fine-grained didacticism of the plot of "Scary Stories", which embodies the very virtues that it promotes. In the process of displaying the redemptive power of factual knowledge, however, the movie flattens and tames the power of imagination."[45]David Ehrlich ofIndieWireadded "André Øvredal's film adaptation, as clever and well-crafted as it is, can't help but invert the formula that the source material relied upon for its success. Here is an R-rated concept that's been watered down until it passed for a PG-13 movie; it's plenty harrowing and full of gruesome effects, but it never feels dangerous."[46]The Atlantic's Julie Beck noted "The best scary stories do that—they get under your skin and emerge again and again. (The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out.)Scary Storiesthe movie just bounces right off."[47]
David Fear ofRolling Stonegave the movie three stars out of five, commenting "It's all a lot of chain-rattling, black-cat-screeching fun, though not such a blast that you don't notice how generic and ramshackle the whole endeavor feels... The pity is that Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark will mostly be seen by jaded genre completists and nostalgic fortysomethings. Wrong demographic. You owe it to your kids to take them to this. It's training-wheels horror done right."[48]Aja Romano ofVoxgave the film three and half points out of five and wrote "...the film leans all the way into the chance to tell a story beset with cultural anxieties of the past that strongly mirror those of the present. It's far more like a classic piece of young adult fiction than the juvenile fiction it's adapting; its focus isn't on kids, but on teens who are coming of age in a turbulent, complicated, and often maliciously unjust world. Their supernatural monsters, in contrast, are culled from juvenile fears and fantasies. The resulting folkloric aesthetic makesScary Stories'brand of fantasy all the more effective as fun visual horror. But on a thematic level, it creates a discordance with the film's more adult social horrors, and the two elements never quite unify."[49]A.A. Dowd ofThe A.V. Clubgave the film B grade and wrote "Like scouts huddled around a campfire, each trying to send a bigger chill down the others' spines,Scary Stories To Tell In The Darkkeeps coming up with new gruesome attractions, piling one on top of the next. Yet as gross and spooky and, yes, occasionally frightening as these terror tactics get, they never quite cross over into the deep end of truly grown-up horror."[50]The Times of India's Neil Soans gave the film three stars out of five, noting "The screenplay ends up as a jumble of unexplored ideas onscreen rather than a cohesive narrative. However, if you only enjoy horror films for creepy monsters, you'll manage to get a kick or two."[51]
In April 2020, it was officially announced that a sequel to the film was in development, with Øvredal returning to direct andParamount Pictures(which had absorbed CBS Films as part of thereintegration of CBS and Viacom) distributing.[53][54]Colletti, Garza, Ganzhorn, and Norris were set to reprise their roles, with the Hagemans returning as writers, and del Toro returning as producer.[55]
As of August 2023, according to Øvredal, work continued on the project; the story had been completed, and the script was being revised.[56]

Even though Tommy's kind of a hardened kid, there's a naïveté to him, and Gil's got a sweetness that comes through."[3]Freeman was surprised that Bellows was a fairly new actor, and said he "relaxed right into it." Bellows said "I really wanted to play Tommy, and I was really hoping the audition wouldn't come down to a name criterion, or l wouldn't have had a hope."[10]The film was nominated for sevenAcademy Awardsincluding "Best Picture".[11]It is often considered as one of greatest films of all times.[12]

Of his character, Bellows said "I loved him from the moment I read the first page of the script, in spite of his profession, he is really a noble character.

On the success of the episode Bellows said "the relationship between Billy and Ally is a major component in the show. There are a lot of other characters on the show who can be considered flashier or more funny but I don't think there's a story line that's more compelling than Billy and Ally. I think their relationship anchors Ally as a human being as opposed to her character as a wacky figment of (producerDavid E.) Kelley's imagination. Billy allows her to explore human emotions that she probably wouldn't be exploring otherwise and I think everybody responds to romance in one way or another.”[31]With the rest of the cast, he won and was nominated twice for "Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series" at theScreen Actors Guild Awards.[32][33][34]During his tenure on the show he reprised his role in the spin-off seriesAlly(1999),[35]and "Axe Murderer" a crossover episode withThe Practice(1998).[36]Bellows announced that he would be leaving the show in season 3, but would make guest appearances moving forward.[37][38]Bellows explained that he felt "the show was starting to fall apart early in the third season" and that his character "started getting kooky.

Bellows believes that the part was "as good and complex a role as I ever had", on the part he said "it really spoke to me, I have children, I'm the grandson of a Holocaust survivor. These shows will get people to talk about the stuff that usually sits in the back of your head spinning before you go to sleep: What's going to happen if I lose you, or what happens if I go." Bellows explained that as they were shooting tragic moments "they're heavy scenes, and you're shaking, you're fighting the tears.

One of them will talk about a spouse or relative."[65]Alison Cunninghan in her praise of the mini-series inThe Ottawa Citizenwrote "Bellows is exceptional. He turns in a stunning performance as a man who manages to anchor his family while he's close to imploding.
