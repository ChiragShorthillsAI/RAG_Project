A man carrying a gun enters a frontier church in Garlow, a town on theCalifornia Trail, and a shot rings out.
In the past, the man, Patrick Tate, attends a service at the church during which the preacher claims that some in the congregation regret banning alcohol, gambling, and prostitution, but that this has made theirs a "Christian" town. After church Pat talks with his friend Ed, who offers to babysit his two kids. Pat and his family enter a store where his son asks if he wants a gun, to which Pat replies that he has a rifle. Meanwhile, a strange man enters, grunts aggressively at the storekeeper, and stares at Pat's wife Audrey. Back at home, Pat and Audrey discuss how they never made it to their goal in California. Pat wishes to move on now that the "Christian" town has quieted down, but Audrey doesn't want to leave.
In the middle of the night, three men approach Pat's home and ask for a man named Bill Crabtree. Though he gives the men directions, their leader demands that he go with them. He takes the men to Bill's wife's house, but she tells them that Bill left town a year earlier. The leader reveals that he is a bounty hunter looking for Bill, who is wanted for murder. Afterward, he asks to be taken to the saloon, where the innkeeper tells him that the preacher threatened to burn his establishment down if he didn't stop supplying alcohol and prostitutes.  Over drinks, the leader introduces himself as Dutch Albert and his companions as Dumb Dumb (whose tongue is cut out) and Sicily, an Italian who does not speak English. Pat introduces himself as a carpenter and undertaker. Dutch claims that he understands how it feels to be an outsider like Pat, an Irish Catholic. Since the innkeeper has no food, the men return to Patrick's house where he wakes Audrey so she can make a meal for them. Dumb Dumb leers at her.
Dutch returns to the innkeeper and buys his hotel to turn it back into a saloon. One month later, it is in full swing with gambling and whores. The innkeeper, Jim Emmett, fetches Patrick because a man "accidentally" dies in the saloon. The sheriff is suspicious, but everyone is silent when asked what happened. At the funeral, the preacher accuses the sheriff of dereliction and demands justice. That night, Dutch wakes Patrick and orders two coffins. He takes Pat to adugoutwhere he kills Bill Crabtree and Crabtree's partner, whom Dutch claims robbed him. He pays Pat to bury the men.
In a card game at the saloon, Dutch cleans out a young man who cannot pay his debt. When Dutch refuses to let him leave, the boy pulls a gun, so Dutch shoots him. He claims to have killed the boy in self-defense, and no one says otherwise. Everyone hears the gunshots across the street in the church and goes to see the body; the sheriff is angry with Dutch but can do nothing. Later, back at the store, Dumb Dumb follows Audrey inside and tries to touch her face, to which she reacts sharply. He seems to grunt "I love you" before leaving in shame. When Audrey tells Pat about the incident, he claims no harm will come to her.
Mrs. Crabtree goes to see Dutch at the saloon and offers to work as a whore because she is starving. Dutch says he will take her and her daughter Emily, but not her alone. At Pat's house, a couple pass by in a wagon, saying they are headed to California and asking where the saloon is. Shortly thereafter, Pat hears gunshots and finds the man dead in the street, presumably killed by Dutch's gang. After preparing the body, he gives his children candy and Audrey a new dress, but she refuses because it is fancy and she will look out of place. Offended, he goes into town and has a drink in the saloon. He has a tense encounter with Dutch, but it is interrupted by a gunshot. Upstairs, Emily has killed the man who paid for her.
After Pat is commissioned to build a gallows to hang Emily, his wife tells him he will be implicated in her death, but he says he must. The next day, Emily is hanged. Dumb Dumb follows Audrey home and stalks her with a knife, but before he can get to her Pat comes up behind him and strangles him, hiding the body in Emily's coffin. Now realizing the depths of his depravity, Pat agrees to leave with Audrey the next day.
That night, the preacher sets the saloon ablaze. Dutch kills him and the sheriff who comes to his defense. Pat takes up the sheriff's gun but walks away from the encounter. The next day, while he buries the two, Sicily tries to kill Audrey. She hides her children and uses Pat's rifle to shoot Sicily in his arm. They fight and she stabs him in the stomach. She takes one of his guns and they shoot each other, killing Sicily. Pat's children run to the graveyard to tell him and he races home to find Audrey gravely injured. He asks Ed to take care of his family if he does not come back.
Pat retrieves his money from its hiding place and buys ablunderbussand a pistol. He loads the blunderbuss with nails and two silver coins, which are traditionally placed on a corpse's eyes. He enters the church, as seen in the first scene, where he finds Dutch and Jim Emmett. Dutch draws on him, but Patrick fires the blunderbuss into Dutch, who shoots him in the gut. Pat then turns his pistol on Jim, killing him. He walks home and collapses on his porch, bleeding badly. His son asks if he is dying and Pat says that he is. His son says that Ed thinks his mother will survive. Pat tells his son that he loves him, his sister, and his mother more than life itself, and instructs him to go get Ed. Pat remains on the porch, dying.
In December 2017, it was announcedEmile Hirsch,John Cusack,Deborah Francois,Antonia Campbell-Hughes,Paul Ronan,Danny Webbhad joined the cast of the film, withIvan Kavanaghdirecting from a screenplay he wrote.[3]In an interview published on Cineuropa prior to its US release, Ivan Kavanagh told Davide Abbatescianni that his main inspiration when writing were ”the frontier photographs from the 1850s onwards. The hardship on the people’s faces was startlingly apparent, and when you listen to the hymns they sang at the time, they are about hardship, the misery of life, and how life will be better on the other side, in Heaven. It is a very sobering and moving view of the founding of America, and of the immigrant experience. I tried to get some of that into the film, as well as paying homage to the westerns I loved as a child.”[4]

Canal+(French:[kanalplys], meaning "Channel Plus"), also speltCanal Plusand sometimes abbreviatedC+orCanal, is a French premium television channel owned byCanal+. The channel was launched in November 1984, and broadcasts toMetropolitan France. It broadcasts several kinds of programming, mostlyencrypted, but some unencrypted content can be viewed free of charge.
Canal+ was co-founded byAndré RousseletandPierre Lescure. An early pioneer wasAlain de Greef[fr], who joined in 1986.
In 1978, six years before Canal's launch, Jean Frydman who had the TVCS (Télévision Communication Services) project was planning a project to launch a fourth television channel in France which had its roots from the previousCanal 10project. Whilst waiting for abling to create an encrypted TV channel, the TVCS project had first planned to produce and broadcast their own programmes during time slots when three French television channels began broadcasting atest cardin the night and in the morning.[1]One year later in July 1979, it was announced that the channel had chosen to broadcast the programmes produced by public national television channel and the TVCS companyAntenne 2(now known as France 2) who had broadcast encrypted programmes that were originally intended for businesses or certain professionals.[2]
In March 1984 eight before the official launch, Canal+ started their retransmission tests in the Île-de-France region. Those first broadcasts were scheduled every day from 2 to 6pm and they were consisted of music videos, animated short films and various movie trailers.
Canal+ was launched in November 1984, when there were only three government-owned channels available in France.[3]The company was co-founded byAndré Rousselet, president of the French multinational advertising companyHavas,[3]andPierre Lescure(bornc.1945), who proved very popular with media professionals and politicians.[4]It got off to a slow start, and some politicians, including prime ministerLaurent Fabius, railed against the idea of having a commercial TV channel. However, Rousselet was a personal friend of the president,François Mitterrand, and so obtained favourable terms for the setup.Pierre Lescurewas director-general at that time. A combination of political connections and clever programming – giving the French public American hit comedies and French drama not available on the government channels – worked and subscriptions soon increased. Government regulations required that the channel give several hours of free programming each day, which was used by Canal+ to promote the subscription service.[3]Its first logo was used from inception until 1995.[citation needed]
The channel initially had to use 45% of its air-time on films, until the film industry pushed back. Sport, interview shows, documentaries, andsoft pornographyjoined films as the main staples of programming at this time.[3]Starting in 1985, Canal+ has had a tradition of showing onepornographic filmevery month  at midnight, generally on the first Saturday of the month.[5]In 1985, the government opened up the market to other private commercial television stations, offering some serious competition. However, aggressive marketing and policies ensured that the company kept growing.[3]
Alain de Greef[fr](c.1947– 29 June 2015) joined in 1986[6]joining his longtime friend Pierre Lescure. De Greef was first appointed director of production, then head of programmes, and finally as director general (1986–2000).[7]De Greef was later described as a pioneer and visionary, who set the tone and created the "Canal Plus spirit", which embodied anti-conformism along with edgy satire that became very popular. He created the satirical puppet showLes Guignols de l'Infoand cult talk showsNulle part ailleurs,[6]Groland, andLes Deschiens.[citation needed]
In 1987, Canal+ wentpublic. By 1989, Canal+ had almost three million subscribers. The company expanded into some European markets, notably Belgium, Spain, and Germany, and started setting up subsidiaries as it developed intoGroupe Canal+.[3]
In 1994, Rousselet quit the board, and was replaced by director-general Lescure.[3]
Digital satellite providerCanalSatellitewas launched as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canal+ on 6 December 1991. On 27 April 1996, Canal+ received two new sister channels: Canal+ Jaune and Canal+ Bleu.[8]A fourth channel, called Canal+ Vert, came along on 31 August 1998. The channels changed their names to Canal+ Confort (now known as Canal+ Décalé since 2005), Canal+ Cinéma, and Canal+ Sport on 1 November 2003.
In January 2000, theLagardère Grouppurchased a major stake in the digital television division.[9][10]In December 2000,Vivendiacquired Canal+.[11]In 2001, co-founder Alain De Greef was fired from his position as director-general and replaced byMichel Denisot, when the organisation wasrestructuredunder the leadership ofJean-Marie Messier, chief executive of Vivendi.[7]Criticism of Vivendi's poor share performance since the takeover grew, and in April 2002, De Greef's co-founder and CEO Pierre Lescure, clashed with Messier and was fired.[4]
An alternative logo was used between 2006 and 2009.
In September 2005, Canal+, Canal+ Cinéma and Canal+ Sport started broadcasting in the Frenchdigital terrestrial televisionnetwork. Thefree-to-airparts of Canal+ had already been broadcasting for a few months by then. In August 2008, Canal+ started broadcasting theencryptedparts of its main channel in high-definition in the terrestrial network. Canal+ announced plans to turn off theanalogue terrestrialsignals by 2010.[12]
In April 2014,Ligue 1, France's topassociation footballleague, sold broadcast rights for 2016–2020 to Canal+ for 726 millioneuros.[13]
In July 2024, reports emerged that Vivendi was exploring a potential London Stock Exchange listing for Canal+.[14]In December 2024, Canal+ Group was spun-out as independent company.[15]The channel will leave the terrestrial platform in France in June 2025, alongside Canal+ Cinéma, Canal+ Sport and Planète+, as a result of the cut in its agreement with Arcom to keep its licences afloats as a response to the non-renewal of its free-to-air channelC8by theArcom. Only 70,000 subscribers receive Canal+ in terrestrial.[16]From 6 June 2025,France 4will take over its slot; from that day, the new digital terrestrial channel plan will be introduced.[17]
Canal+ broadcasts toMetropolitan France. Its programming is mostlyencrypted, but some unencrypted programming can be viewed free of charge. The channel does not broadcast advertising, except when broadcasting onfree-to-airslots. Almost all foreign films and series can be viewed either in their original language with French subtitles (on a secondary audio channel) or dubbed in French. All programs are subtitled in French for deaf people and those who struggle with hearing. Some programs also have audio description for those who are visually impaired.[citation needed]
Canal+ is a supporter of theHybrid Broadcast Broadband TV(HbbTV) initiative, which promotes and establishes an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface.[citation needed]
Originally, subscribers would be mailed a code to punch in on their decoder's control panel to view the encrypted service (using theRITC Discret 1system); the code would be based upon the decoder's serial number (stored in the box's ROM). To avoid problems with customer's codes being not delivered on time by the postal system, Canal+ would switch to encryption based on a generic key, between the last day of the month (beginning at midnight) and the first Monday of the next month (until 9 AM). During this time, all decoders—even those with lapsed subscriptions—would be able to view the channel.[18]
However, signal piracy was rampant, especially after the magazineRadio Plansprinted decoder plans in their December 1984 issue. As a result of this, Canal+ switched to the much strongerNagravisionencryption system beginning in 1992; the Discret system was fully phased out by 1995. The new decoders utilised smart cards, cut into the shape of a key and inserted into the front of the decoder. Different decoders using theD2-MACstandard were also deployed during this time, mostly for cable subscribers. With the launch of CanalSatellite, theMediaguardencryption system was instituted, created bySECA(Société Européenne de Contrôle d'Accès), a firm owned by Canal+ andBertelsmann; Canal+ eventually bought out Bertelsmann's stake and rebranded SECA as Canal+ Technologies. This firm was sold by 2003 toThomson SA. The MediaGuard system's use in Britain (by the now defunctOnDigital/ITV Digital) led to hackers in the employ ofRupert Murdoch's rival encryption company NDS breaking into the MediaGuard system, resulting in new cards being issued to Canal+ subscribers in 2002 and Canal+ starting legal action against Murdoch. The Nagravision system continued in use until 30 November 2011, when all analog television broadcasting in France ceased.[19][20][21]
Les Chaînes Canal+is the offer name regrouping the premium Canal+-branded channels in France.[22]From 2003 to 2008 it was calledCanal+ Le Bouquet.[citation needed]

I would love to think about other things—poetry, love, anything else. But that’s just not the times we’re in. And, y’know, not all anger is just sort of somebody stuck in some rut in a basement. If you can’t be outraged on behalf of other people, or express anger at injustice, maybe that is its own rut. Sure, I might go too far sometimes. But I really just want to get across the message: that we’re sleepwalking into an incredibly dark possible future. Maybe being outspoken hurts your career… I’m just aware it helps me sleep better at night, knowing that I wasn’t passive during this time.
