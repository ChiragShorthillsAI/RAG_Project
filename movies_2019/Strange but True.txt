Later, Gail is doing laundry and finds Bill's cigarette stash, as well as a half-usedblister packof pills. She heads to the pharmacy to ask about them.
After a tense breakfast between Charlene and Philip, Philip puts forth the idea that Ronnie'sfrozen spermcould have been used to impregnate Melissa. Charlene goes to the library, where she used to work, to research the idea and then calls her ex-husband, Richard, a physician. She asks him whether or not frozen sperm can be used to impregnate someone. Richard hangs up and later calls Philip and then Bill's Hardware. Meanwhile, Philip visits the same psychic Melissa saw, who tells him he needs to move on from Ronnie's death.
Charlene goes to Erwin's home to speak to Melissa. However, Gail answers the door and mentions that she is thankful that Richard pays rent on behalf of Melissa while she stays in their lodge. Charlene calls Richard again, angry about what Gail has told her. Holly, Richard's new wife, answers the phone and states that Richard is heading to New York to see Charlene. Charlene intercepts Richard at the airport and confronts him about paying Melissa's rent. On the way home, they argue about Melissa and the aftermath of Ronnie's death.
Philip has gone to see Melissa at her cottage. They talk about Philip's broken leg, which broke when he allowed a car to run into him while he worked as a bike messenger. He had moved to New York City because of a plan he made with Ronnie before he died and then was looking for an excuse to leave. Melissa discusses her blackouts and her dreams of Ronnie.

Bill chases Philip through the woods, eventually catching him and knocking him out with the butt of the shotgun. Melissa drives herself to the hospital.
Bill digs a shallow grave in his barn to bury Philip. Charlene and Richard show up at the house and Bill is able to convince them nothing is amiss. However, Charlene sees one of Philip's crutches on the ground outside. Charlene and Richard go into the house after hearing Phil's phone ring only to find Gail's dead body. Bill attempts to bury Philip alive, but Philip begins to struggle, calling out so Richard and Charlene hear. Bill starts to choke Philip, but Philip is able to knock over the shotgun and pull the trigger, alerting his parents. Richard charges in and stands with Philip. Bill raises the shotgun towards Richard and Philip but then Charlene stands between them. Bill says he didn't mean to hurt her and then kills himself.
Melissa gives birth to her baby and a flashback shows the night Ronnie died in an accident while being chauffeured in a limousine.
