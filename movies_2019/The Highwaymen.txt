The film had been indevelopment hellfor many years, with producerCasey Silverlooking into the project as early as 2005. Originally pitched by Fusco as a possiblePaul NewmanandRobert Redfordproject, the film began development atUniversal Picturesbut never came to fruition. In February 2018, it was reportedNetflixhad picked up the rights to the film and that Costner and Harrelson would star. Filming took place later that month and in March, shooting aroundLouisianaand at several historical sites, including the road where Bonnie and Clyde were killed.[4][5]
The Highwaymenhad alimited theatrical releasein the United States on March 15, 2019, before being released digitally on March 29, 2019, on Netflix. It received mixed reviews from critics.
In 1934, after two years on the run, criminalsBonnie Parker and Clyde Barrowbreak several associates out ofTexas'Eastham Prison Farm.Texas Department of CorrectionsChief Lee Simmons persuadesGovernor"Ma" Fergusonto hire formerTexas RangerFrank Hamerto track down the criminals.
After the fugitive gang is involved in a devastating shootout inMissouri, Hamer reluctantly leaves retirement and his wife Gladys to join the manhunt. He recruits his former partner, Benjamin Maney Gault, despite his misgivings about Gault's sobriety and decayed policing abilities. He refuses to share the driving with Gault.
Information fromFBIwiretappingof the fugitives' families leads Hamer and Gault to conclude that Bonnie and Clyde are returning "home" toDallas. Watching Bonnie's mother's house, they see a man throw a bottle into her yard, which is soon thrown back, but a boy escapes with it.
Dismissing the Rangers' theory, the FBI believe the fugitives are inBrownsville. Hamer and Gault meet with Dallas Sheriff "Smoot" Schmid, who introduces them to Deputy SheriffTed Hinton, a childhood friend who can identify them on sight. The gang kills two policemen in nearbyGrapevine; Hamer and Gault investigate the scene and determine that Bonnie has a rabbit, which Hinton suggests is a present for a family member.
The Rangers drive toOklahomaand question a gas station attendant, who supports the criminals. Hamer gets the man to admit the gang passed through en route to a migrant camp, where a local girl confirms they stayed. A radio bulletin alerts the Rangers to two more murdered officers happening outside their jurisdiction. They are barred from passing the police roadblock, which a frustrated Hamer drives around.
They continue toCoffeyville,Kansas, correctly deducing that Bonnie and Clyde will stop there for supplies. As the Rangers move in on the fugitives, an adoring crowd surrounds the criminals' car. Hamer and Gault give chase, but Bonnie and Clyde escape through a dirt field.
Learning that Clyde had breakfast inAmarillo, the Rangers return to Dallas to find the rabbit has been delivered to Bonnie's family. Hamer meets Henry Barrow, Clyde's father, who affirms that his son must be stopped. The Rangers have Simmons furlough Wade McNabb, an incarcerated associate of the gang, hoping to draw them out.
While Hamer interrogates McNabb at a bar, Gault is threatened in the restroom by thugs sympathetic to the gang, but he subdues them. Learning that Bonnie plans to meet a hairdresser the next day, the Rangers surveil her mother's house again. A man throws another bottle into the yard, which is retrieved by the same boy but intercepted by the Rangers; it contains a message that the gang are heading elsewhere. Realizing McNabb warned the gang, the Rangers visit his home and discover him beaten to death.
Simmons recalls Hamer and Gault toAustin, but they return to their theory that "outlaws always go home", predicting that the fugitives are going toBienville Parish, Louisiana, home of gang memberHenry Methvin's father, Ivy. Searching Ivy's house, the Rangers find evidence of the outlaws' recent stay. They join forces with local Sheriff Henderson Jordan and Deputy Prentiss Oakley to confront Ivy; in exchange for his son's safety, he reveals that the gang will soon return.
The lawmen are joined by Hinton and Dallas Sheriff's Deputy Bob Alcorn, and Gault tells them ofhis first deployment with Hamer: they killed a gang of bandits, including a fleeing 13-year-old boy. Ivy informs them the gang is arriving the next day, and theposseprepare an ambush on the road to his house, staging his truck as if it has broken down.
Bonnie and Clyde arrive, stopping to assist Ivy, and Hamer orders them to raise their hands. Instead, the criminals prepare to draw their own weapons, but are gunned down. The bullet-riddled car with Bonnie and Clyde's bodies is towed toArcadia, Louisianaand mobbed by onlookers. Refusing $1,000 for an interview with theAssociated Press, Hamer and Gault drive home. En route, Hamer allows Gault to drive.
