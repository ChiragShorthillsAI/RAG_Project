Playmobil: The Movieis a 2019 live-action/animatedadventure comedy filmbased on the German building toyPlaymobil. The film was directed byLino DiSalvo(in his feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by Blaise Hemingway and the writing team of Greg Erb and Jason Oremland. The film stars the voices ofAnya Taylor-Joy,Jim Gaffigan,Gabriel Bateman,Adam Lambert,Kenan Thompson,Meghan Trainor, andDaniel Radcliffe. The plot follows a girl who tries to save her brother from a Playmobil world that the two are sucked into and becomes involved in the midst of a population-capturing scheme by Emperor Maximus.
Playmobil: The Moviepremieredat theAnnecy International Animated Film Festivalon June 10, 2019, and was released in France on August 7,  in the United Kingdom on August 9, and in the United States on December 6. The film was panned by critics for being a perceived feature-length advertisement; most criticisms were directed to its poor storytelling, musical numbers, characters, tone, andworldbuildingproblems, with several unfavourable comparisons toThe Lego Movie(2014), although some praise focused on its animation. It was also abox-office bomb, grossing $16.3 million on a $40–75 million budget, and in the United States had the worst opening weekend ever for a film playing in over 2,300 theaters.[6][7]
Marla is a formerly free-spirited girl who has grown up to be responsible yet overprotective in caring for her brother, Charlie. Charlie has grown lonely and disconnected from her after their parents died in a car accident. One night, Charlie sneaks out to visit a toy museum with a Playmobil exhibit. After Marla arrives and tells Charlie off for running away, a lighthouse illuminates them and transports them to the Playmobil world.
Marla and Charlie–who has been transformed into a Viking warrior–find themselves in the middle of aVikingbattle, and Charlie helps them until he is kidnapped by a group ofpirates. Frantic to find her brother, Marla goes to the nearest town hoping to ask for help and runs into Del, the driver of afood truckwhose client refuses to pay him over pink hay that causes the town's horses to sprout wings. As Marla tries to form a posse to find Charlie, Del gets her out of trouble when she shows Viking gold to the whole town and agrees to help Marla find her brother in exchange for the gold.
Marla and Del run into Rex Dasher, a secret agent and an old friend of Del. Rex explains that several characters have disappeared, and the group sneaks into a villainous spy headquarters to find information about the disappearances. Despite some issues, they successfully gather the data and escape, but the pirates later capture Rex. He is taken to Constantinopolis and finds Charlie, who had been locked up with other characters by Emperor Maximus, who intends to have the prisoners fight to their deaths. Rex tells Charlie that Marla has been looking for him, which encourages Charlie to break away. However, he later allows himself to be recaptured, so the other characters can escape.
Del recognizes that a device used by the pirates belongs to Glinara, an aliencrime lord. After meeting with her in exchange for information, Del offers to pay twice as much as he owes her. Glinara agrees and reveals that she sold the device to Maximus. However, Del cannot uphold his end of the bargain, as Marla only has two pieces of gold left. Angered, Glinara captures them and attempts to drop them into a portal, but they are spared by Glinara's robot servant, Robotitron, who hacks the portal and drops the group into a forest. Del leaves the group, upset by Marla's deception. Marla and Robotitron get lost in the forest until Marla accidentally hits afairy godmother, who encourages her to continue her search and sends her to Constantinopolis.
Arriving in the city, Marla reaches a coliseum where Charlie is about to fight aTyrannosaurus rex. Charlie and Marla work together to fight off the T-Rex but to no avail. Del soon arrives with his food truck, and Marla uses the last of Del's pink hay to turn the T-Rex harmless. An enraged Maximus orders his guards to arrest them, but the guards reveal themselves as Rex and the missing warriors, who lock Maximus inside a cage. As everyone celebrates their victory, Marla and Charlie use the T-Rex to fly back to the lighthouse and return to the real world, where it is revealed that they were missing for only five minutes. On good terms, Marla promises Charlie that their relationship will be mended.
An animated feature film based onPlaymobilfigurines, produced by On Entertainment,Wild BunchandPathé, was announced in November 2014 and originally expected to be released at the end of 2017.[16]
The film originally involvedBob Persichettias director and screenwriter. The film would be the first in a trilogy of theatrical animated films based on Playmobil. Persichetti initially pitched the film toSony Pictures Animation. Although Sony tried to buy the pitch, it fell through. He was eventually offered instead to direct the 2018 superhero filmSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.[17]
The film was animated in On Animation's Canadian facilities. The film was also originally supposed to be distributed byCross Creek Pictures.[18]
ON Animation's producers acquired the rights for the film circa January 2016.[19]On 9 February 2016, Lino DiSalvo came on board to direct the $75 million budgeted film, replacing Persichetti. Dimitri Rassam and Aton Soumache of On Animation Studios produced the film.[20][21]
On 12 May 2016,Open Road Filmsacquired the US rights to the film, whose screenplay was written by Blaise Hemingway. It marks DiSalvo's directorial debut after spending 17 years atWalt Disney Animation Studios. Alexis Vonarb, Axel Von Maydell, andMoritz Bormanalso produced the film.[22]Maydell was first associated with the Playmobil brand fifteen years before the film's release, when he was involved in producing interactive games for the company.[23]Heitor Pereira's involvement was announced on 21 June 2017.[24]
On 17 November 2017, it was reported thatWendi McLendon-Coveywould star in the film.[25]In June 2018, the film's production was underway and some details of the film were revealed, during a session atAnnecy International Animated Film Festival.[26]In October 2018, lead voice cast was announced which includedAnya Taylor-Joy,Gabriel Bateman,Daniel Radcliffe,Jim Gaffigan,Meghan Trainor, andAdam Lambert, while Trainor and Lambert would also write and sing original songs for the film.[27]
DiSalvo instantly got to work on animatics following Open Road's acquisition, completing five animatics in Los Angeles and Montreal before work on the assets began.[19]The first 15 months of the film's production was spent in Los Angeles, with a crew of ten people. When the project moved to Montreal, 300 people ("more than half of the animation crew at a typical Disney movie") were involved.[19]Both DiSalvo and Hemingway, long-time friends, re-watched their favorite 1980s films likeE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial(1982) in writingPlaymobil; Hemingway explained that both the movie and the old-school films they referenced knew "how to find what is magical in the most mundane situations."[28]
The producers wanted to capture a child's emotion of playing with toys withPlaymobil,[23]which meant DiSalvo had to research. He interviewed more than 200 fans of Playmobil from across the globe,[29]finding that the toy series was mostly enjoyed for itsrole playelement, where "they don't tell you who the hero is — the player defines who the hero is."[19]Thus, he went for a role-playing vibe in writing the film's story.[19]DiSalvo also revisited his childhood home to look at the toys he played with as a kid.[30]The German Playmobil company also sent every Playmobil set ever released to the Los Angeles development location, and the writers used them to conceive characters. A food truck and a figure wearing a Hawaiian shirt, for instance, led to the creation of Del.[29]
Initially, the writers plannedPlaymobil: The Movieto start with either a shot of an opening storybook or a narration, similar to most fairy tale movies. These ideas were rejected due to not being "organic" enough for the overall product.[19]They finally chose to have opening and closing live-action sequences: "Marla, has lost touch with the child's point of view that she used to have. It felt right to show her in a live-action world where there is no magic. When she finds herself in a very magical situation — which is the entrance to the world of Playmobil, it becomes the catalyst for the whole movie."[19]
Playmobil: The Moviewas animated withAutodesk Maya.[31]Julien Bocabeille supervised the film's animation team, which consisted of 56 animators.[32]Being thatPlaymobil: the Moviewas a story about wish fulfillment, the scale was one of the biggest priorities. According to production designer Rémi Salmon: "We see those toys from a kid's eyes, not what he has in front of him but what he imagines. The pirate in his hand has a stiff plastic cape, but when he plays, he sees the cape floating in the wind."[19]The animators' biggest challenges came in the set designs and character animation.[32]While each Playmobil universe varied in tone and lighting due to their differing styles, they had to have some consistencies with the Playmobil world.[32]The Fifth Elementand the works ofJ. J. Abramswere influences in designing the city of Glinara.[33]
Having "a touch of richness and life" in the film's Playmobil world depended on not just the lighting being "pushed pretty far in a very cinematographic way"; but also the characters, particularly their movements and textures.[19]While having plastic hair and skin, the toys were given "a 20 percent freedom to bend and stretch".[19]The animators had to work with limits that came with moving the Playmobil figures, especially when it came to animating faces. The faces are 2D shapes mapped onto 3D heads, meaning that big parts of how human faces areexpressed(cheekbones, nose, and jaws) are not present.[32]
Coming up with a convenient workflow for animating 2D faces on 3D objects was another challenge, which Jeremy Ringard and Claude Levastre were responsible for. They first came up with the idea of modeling andriggingthe features as 3D shapes, but this led to problems ofZ-fighting, intersection, and "floating" appearances in close-up shots.[34]They then thought of a "textureflipbook", where the animators chose from a set of facial features in order to keep the look of the movie consistent; however, they figured that it would disallow any variations to the expressions and be very expensive due to the amount of storage, texture resolution, and file management involved.[31]Finally, they came up with a system where the animators used 3D-rig-controlled 2D shapes that were converted as a dynamic texture applied on the 3D head in theviewport, and the animation would be rendered inreal-timethrough ashaderfree of resolution or sampling restrictions.[31]
The car Dasher drives is a Porsche Mission E, the 2015 concept version of thePorsche Taycan;Playmobilis the Porsche's first appearance in a major film, and a remote-controlled Mission E toy was released as amovie tie-in.[35]
Today, we have so many cynical movies and TV shows out there, but I wanted to make a movie about a family coming together. Hopefully, parents and their kids will feel the same way about the movie, and appreciate the truthfulness of Playmobil as we tried to explore the wonderful truth that's in these toys.
Many of us have seenJames Bond's films,Clint Eastwood'sspaghetti westerns, and cloak and sword films as children. When we started to talk about moving from one genre to another, we ended up like kids playing with their Playmobil in the living room!
According to DiSalvo, the moral ofPlaymobil: The Movieis, "The only rules that matter are the ones you set."[37]As Nick Hasted ofThe Arts DeskcategorizedPlaymobil, "it's a breezy B-movie in a genre aspiring toMadcomic satire andgrand opera;" with an "unpretentious good nature" a la 1980s and 1990s after-school specials.[38]Due toPlaymobilbeing set in a worldfilled with different universes, the film caricaturizes and plays with the tropes of several genres, includingwestern films,fantasy,science fiction, andmusicals.[30]In acknowledging inevitable comparisons toThe Lego Movie, DiSalvo claimed, "The movieLegorelied a lot on comedy and wasn't so much driven by characters, while our film will follow more theDisneytradition of storytelling and is meant to appeal to girls as much as boys."[26]According to Tito Ortiz,Playmobilis about the importance of forgiveness, tolerance, and unity in broken families.[36]
DiSalvo also describedPlaymobil: The Movieas similar to theTom HanksfilmBig(1988), in that the main character has to think like a child to achieve her goal.[29]Its premise of two siblings being sucked into a fantastical setting also garnered comparisons by journalists toThe Pagemaster(1994),[39]theJumanjifilms,[39]andPleasantville(1998);[40]while the use of a live-action opening and a brother-and-sister relationship was also inThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part(2019).[39][41]Some reviewers noted the shedding ofgender rolesinPlaymobil, including Hasted: "When DiSalvo detours to Playmobil's girl-focused range with the arrival of Meghan Trainor's tattooed fairy godmother and pink flying horses, Marla's brisk bravery muddles gender stereotypes with similar irreverence."[38]Caroline Siede honored the film's "Be anything you want to be" message for allowing Marla to be any type of character regardless of her gender,[39]and Charlotte O'Sullivan of theEvening Standardcalled her a betterSusan Pevensie: "Though interested in lipstick, and keen on being grown-up, she is never dismissed as silly or vain."[42]OneNBC Newsreview noted Dasher's "pointed jabs about sexist archetypes."[43]
"Run Like the River" (sung byMeghan Trainor) was released as a promotional single from the film's soundtrack album on 26 July 2019; the album was released on 2 August 2019.[44]
Playmobil: The Moviepremiered as the opener of the 2019 Annecy festival, which ran from 10 to 15 June 2019.[45]As reported byCartoon Brew, it "was widely criticized by festival attendees and caused large numbers of the audience to leave in the middle of the film."[46]On 17 June,CineEuropepresented a trailer and a clip ofPlaymobil.[47]
Playmobil: The Moviehad its first trailer released on 16 December 2018, with a release date set for 16 August 2019.[40]The second trailer was released on 23 July 2019 with the release date changed to 22 November.[48][49]Each trailer present a different premise: the first presented the film as focusing on Marla trying to save her brother in a Playmobil.[40]while the second revealed the live-action segments and depicted it as being about Rex Dasher saving the Playmobil population from a secret organization.[50]Ben Pearson of/Filmnoted that the marketing strategy "trie[d] to shield its actual plot."[50]He also called the film's animation promising: "While the characters are clearly simplified to match the Playmobil toys that inspired them, the animation looks pretty slick and there's some interesting lighting going on in a few of the shots on display here."[50]
Chris Evangelista of /Film wrote upon the first trailer's release, "It's pretty clear thatPlaymobil: The Movieis skewing to a young audience [...] And while this may seem like a cynical cash-grab, many people felt the same way before the firstLEGO Moviecame out until the final results proved to be surprisingly enjoyable. MaybePlaymobilwill manage to do the same."[40]CNET, also responding to the trailer, opined that "It looks fun and hopefully will boast the same universal appeal asthe Lego Movie."[51]Commenting on the second trailer,Screen Rantwriter Mike Jones felt the humor had its "own charm and feel" despite being comparable toThe Lego Movie: "there does appear to be a decent amount of fun, laughs and adventure on display."[48]However, he also questioned the scheduling of "such a small scale" production being scheduled in a season having to compete withJumanji: The Next LevelandStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.[48]Collider's coverage of the second trailer was ecstatic, noting its "fun" factor and opining it had the same meta humor style asThe Lego Movie.[52]Sarah El-Mahmoud ofCinema Blendsummarized, "the trailer showcases tons of fun action sequences with fast car chases, dinosaurs, and scared squirrels. [...] One has to wonder if a connection to human kids will also be present in this movie asThe LEGO MovieandToy Storydo." However, with the awareness that the film was trying to capitalize on the fame ofThe Lego Movie, she also had skepticism toward its success due to the weak box office ofThe LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part.[53]APopSugarjournalist claimed, "damn, it looks good," also showing enthusiasm for Radcliffe's appearance.[54]According toGeekspin, "a few people already have a hunch that the Playmobil movie will flop at the box office," due to the superior popularity of LEGO over Playmobil, and the film's lack ofintellectual properties, and star power.[55]
Playmobil: The Moviewas released in France byPathéon 7 August 2019, on 610 screens, and was released in the US bySTX Entertainmenton 6 December 2019. It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States byOpen Road Filmson 18 January 2019,[22]which was later delayed to 19 April 2019,[56]Due to the bankruptcy of Global Road, STX bought the U.S. distribution rights to the film in early April 2019,[57]and set the U.S. release date to 30 August 2019. On 5 August 2019, STX pushed the U.S. release date back once more to 6 December 2019, among other schedule changes of other films from STX that reportedly happened due to STX having limited cash flow, and wanting to pull their resources in to supportingHustlers, although STX has denied that this was the case.[58]Upon its release in the United States on 6 December, STX reportedly encouraged theaters to offer tickets to all showings of the film for just US$5, a significantly lower cost than most American movie tickets.[59]The film news siteMovieholealso gave away ten family passes ofPlaymobil.[60]

On 4 February 2020,Playmobil: The Movie VR Adventures, a virtual reality video game, was released on Steam.[112]
Playmobil: The Moviegrossed $1.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $15.2 million in other territories, totaling $16.3 million worldwide.[5][4]
In France,Playmobilopened to 604 theaters before playing at a maximum of 683 in its third week; it opened at number five with an opening weekend gross of $963,910.  By the end of its seven-week run, it grossed a total of $2,627,246.[113]
In the United States,Playmobil: The Movieopened in 2,300 theaters;[114]industry experts predicted the film would have a three-day opening gross of around $905,000[115]and would likely become abox office bomb.[116]Preview screenings on 4 December and 5 December were very low, with 4 December totaling around $40,000 and 5 December $230,000.[3]AsThe A.V. Clubsummarized, "STX is dropping it into U.S. theaters the weekend after Thanksgiving without press screenings, giving it the authentic discount-bin appearance of a toy store going out of business."[117][118]
The US marketing budget was limited to roughly $3 million,[119]and RelishMix reported a lack of social promotion of any of its stars except for one tweet from Trainor.[3]STX set the marketing money this low due to the film's poor international box office.[120]Boxoffice Proanalyzed the film "would open just two weeks afterFrozen II, one week beforeJumanji: The Next Level, two weeks beforeStar Wars: The Rise of the Skywalker, and less than three weeks beforeSpies in Disguise— all of which are shoe-ins to attract young audiences and dwarf potential interest inPlaymobil."[121]According to STX president Kevin Grayson, "STX is a 52-week-a-year business and we were looking for an opportunity to utilize the early December play date."[120]
According toDeadline Hollywood,Playmobilwas released only weeks afterFrozen IIand used avariable pricingstrategy where STX and many theater chains offered $5 tickets.[3]Originally projected to gross $600,000–$800,000 on its opening day,Playmobilgrossed just $167,000, making it the third-worst opening day of all time for a 2,000-plus theatre production, behindDelgo(2008) andThe Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure(2012);[119]fourth if counting the2014 re-releaseofSaw(2004) and 24th if also including films with between 1,000 and 1,999 theaters.[122][123]It went on to gross $660,000 in its opening weekend (an average of $287 per-venue), the fourth-worst of all-time.[3]
Shortly after the weekend, Grayson responded that STX would use variable pricing in their future projects: "we have already learned from this experiment. And we will continue to learn more and will tweak it for the future so it can be the benefit to the industry that we know it can be."[120]While the film's several worldwide distributors recouped TV sale money, they also financed it via pre-sales and thus face losses.[120]Rebecca Rubin, aVarietywriter, attributed the low box office to the Playmobil brand being far less popular than Lego.[120]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 18% based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 4.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "Much like the toys it advertises,Playmobil: The Movieseems sadly destined to be regarded as a superficially similar yet less desirable alternative to the competition."[124]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 25 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[125]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an average 1.5 out of 5 stars, with 36% saying they would definitely recommend it.[3]In the PostTrak grade, adult audiences made up 31% of poll, children under 12 69%; the adult gave the film an average 2.5 stars, the kids under 12 around 3.5 to four stars.[3]
The New Zealand online publicationStuffnamed it "a strong contender for the worst film of 2019."[126]Reviewers primarily criticizedPlaymobil: The Moviefor being more of an advertisement than a compelling story that practiced its moral about being bold and adventurous.[127][128][129][130][131][132]In a Rotten Tomatoes editorial, the site said critics generally called it "a regrettably mediocre outing that offers little aside from a barrage of colorful images and a brisk but ultimately generic and uninspired story."[133]AsEntertainment.ie, calling it "the worst animation of the year so far," put it, "the story is boring, the characters are utterly unlikeable [...] one is increasingly struck by the lack of anything new or interesting in the film whatsoever. Its lack of imagination or creativity is painful."[134]A couple of reviews viewed it as part of a major problem of poorly-done toy films from Hollywood.[43][129]Several reviews made negative comparisons toThe Lego Movie,[130][135][131][132][136]such as aVarietyreview by Day Lodge that summarizedPlaymobil: The MovieasThe Lego Movie"but without that blockbuster's dizzy, self-aware wit and visual invention."[128]
Nell Minowwrote that "it does not even work as a commercial, never showing us why these toys could be especially fun to play with," and called the settings and toys "bland and generic."[137]Some critics found it way too safe for a film about imagination,[131][41]including Katherine McLaughlin ofThe List: "The references are simply too familiar to excite, as it coasts along on nostalgia and a well-worn formula."[41]According toThe Observer, "Playmobilshamelessly steals ideas. This eyesore of a cash-in lifts plot elements fromThorandJumanji, then thinly threads them together with a few songs and shrill mantra about the need for adventure."[138]
Multiple errors inworldbuildingwere spotted by critics,[139]such as its odd mixture of replications of historical and fictional settings;[140]and the overly-realistic textures[140]and movements of the Playmobil figures.[141][137]As Minow explained, "After a whole scene establishing the limited mobility of the Playmobil characters, they suddenly switch to being able to have human-like joints and range of motion."[137]Clariss Loughrey asked, "Shouldn't everything be plastic? Then why do the horses have fur?"[140]Yolanda Machado noted, "Marla can't figure out how to walk without the use of knees and yet, a minute later, she's running."[139]Maryann Johanson noticed even more issues with the figure movements: "A big joke is made out of how Marla, in her Playmobil body, can't walk because she has no knees... and then knees inexplicably appear and she can walk fine. Everyone has elbows, too, which the toy figures also don't have. And everyone is stuck with those clamshell hands, yet are still able to manipulate chopsticks."[142]As Paul Whitington felt, "the themed kingdoms they visit only seem to have been chosen because Playmobil do toys based on these scenarios: sometimes, as in the wild west sequence, they are passed through virtually without comment."[143]The live-action sequences also garnered some derision;[132]one reviewer opined it felt "like something out of an '80s movie,"[43]while another panned the sequence's stiff direction.[38]
Salt Lake City Weeklycalled all of the film's concepts "all pointlessly random and head-smackingly dumb, even when it sounds on paper like it might be funny."[144]According to Machado,Playmobil: The Moviesuffered from storytelling "whiplash," using the "mishmash of odd characters" and the sudden death of the main characters' parents as examples.[139]The A.V. Clubcriticized the choppy plot and erratic pace, reasoning it madePlaymobil: The Movie"poorly conceived at every story turn, unable to even stick to a particular generic message to make up for its extremely basic humor."[145]The film's hurried speed also came up in aRadio Timesreview that stated it "never stops long enough to make its story memorable."[146]Lodge wrote the film had so little amusement it was absent of sight gags,[128]while Minow bashed the inclusion of parental death as too dark for a kid's film.[137]AnRTÉ.iereview called its emotional moments "heavy-handed and forced," and criticized the parents' death as "solely a plot device for the sake of plot device."[147]The songs were also called forgettable, generic, and "terrible" by several journalists;[137][132][128][39][134]one wrote that they "have remarkably little melodic staying power,"[128]and another analyzed, "there's no chorus and the characters simply just say things to a tune."[140]However, some reviewers did highlight Taylor-Joy's singing on the opening number.[140][39]
Playmobil: The Moviewasn't without supporting reviewers. Siede was appreciative towards the "low-key, non-judgmental" writing of the film, praising it for being more "heartfelt and earnest" than other "crass and cheap" offerings usual for children's flicks.[39]O'Sullivan summarized, "for a movie so clearly doubling as product placement, it's also fun, a cartoon (bookended by live-action sequences) which allows talented actors to riff on unexpected themes." She called the characters of Del and Rex "properly funny."[42]Most admirations came towards the characters and performances, especially Radcliffe's voice-acting,[140][38][41]the campy villain Emperor Maximus,[43][148][140][38]and Taylor-Joy's acting.[41][38]Hasted opined, "Taylor-Joy's tendency towards introverted, perhaps dangerous outsiders [...] finds little outlet in mostly mild Marla, but still makes her harassed heroine warmly sympathetic."[38]Sandie Angulo Chen ofCommon Sense Mediagave the film two stars out of five, saying that it was "bland and unoriginal but may still amuse young kids."[149]
Playmobil: The Moviewas released toBlu-rayin the United Kingdom on 2 December 2019,[150]France on 7 December 2019,[151]Germany on 27 December 2019,[152]Australia on 25 March 2020,[153]and Canada on 30 June 2020.[154]DVDswere released in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2019[155]and the United States on 3 March 2020.[156]The film was released digitally in France on 7 December 2019,[157]Denmark on 6 January 2020,[158]and the United States on 3 March 2020.[159]

James Christopher Gaffigan(born July 7, 1966) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and producer. His material often addresses fatherhood, laziness, food, religion, and general observations. He is regarded as a "clean" comic, using little profanity in his routines, although he does use it from time to time.[1]He has released several successful comedy specials, includingMr. Universe,Obsessed,Cinco, andQuality Time, all of which have receivedGrammynominations.
Gaffigan's memoirDad Is Fat(2013) and his most recent bookFood: A Love Story(2014) were both published byCrown Publishers. He co-created and starred in theTV LandseriesThe Jim Gaffigan Show, based on his life. He collaborates extensively with his wife, actressJeannie Gaffigan, with whom he has five children.
Gaffigan was born on July 7, 1966,[2]inElgin, Illinois,[3]the youngest of six children born to charity worker and fundraiser Marcia Miriam (née Mitchell) and banker Michael Ambrose Gaffigan.[4][5]Of Irish descent, his family's surname was Gavahan.[5]His maternal grandfather wasIowa Supreme CourtJusticeRichard F. Mitchell.[5]Gaffigan was raised inChestertoninNorthwest Indiana, a region that he has stated influenced his comedy because of its authenticity,[6]and often jokes about growing up in a large family.[7]His mother was accomplished atneedleworkand received a national award for original design and craftsmanship from the American Needlepoint Guild in 1985.[8]She died of cancer in 1990 at age 53.[8]
Gaffigan's father was the president and CEO of the Mercantile National Bank of Indiana for 15 years until his retirement in 1991.[9]A formerseminarian, he was also actively involved in local charity work.[10]He died oflung cancerin 1999.[10]Gaffigan's father was the first in his family to attend college,[11]and encouraged his children to seek careers that promised job security.[12]However, at about the age of five, Gaffigan announced that he wanted to be an actor.[13]
As a teenager, Gaffigan watchedSaturday Night Live.[11]He attendedLa Lumiere SchoolinLa Porte, Indiana, where he played on the school'sfootballteam. He attendedPurdue Universityfor one year, where he was a member of thePhi Gamma Deltafraternity, before transferring toGeorgetown University'sMcDonough School of Business, where he graduated in 1988 with a degree in finance.[12][14]He played football atGeorgetownandPurdue.[15][16]Although he "hated" studying finance, he worked as a litigation consultant for a short time after graduating and "was horrible at it".[17]
Gaffigan moved to New York in 1990 to pursue comedy,[14]a move that was inspired by his admiration for fellowHoosierDavid Letterman.[18]He worked in advertising during the day[12]and took acting classes at night.[7][18]During this time, he was cast inBlockbuster Video's"Entertainment Squad" series of commercials.[19]His career began in earnest when a friend from his acting class dared him to take astand-upseminar that required a live set at the end.[7][13]He fell in love with stand-up,[7]and began playing comedy clubs nightly—after his evening acting classes—until the early hours of the morning.[18]He was often found sleeping at his day job; his boss had to wake him up to fire him.[18]
For the first seven years of Gaffigan's stand-up career, he tried various styles, ranging from angry comedy to impressions and voices. Live comedy was in decline following its peak in the 1980s, and was further affected by the increased popularity ofcable television.[7]After periodically auditioning forThe Late Show with David Lettermanfor six years,[20]Gaffigan did a successful stand-up routine on the show in 1999,[21][22]and his career took off.[18]
Gaffigan's style is largelyobservational. Some of his main topics are laziness, eating and parenthood. His famousHot Pocketroutine was inspired by a commercial he saw that he mistook for aSaturday Night Livesketch.[13]He often performssoliloquies. For example, in high-pitched voice, he may portray someone giving negative feedback on his own performance (After he made a diarrhea joke in his 2012 special "Mr. Universe", he used the voice to say, "Really, he's using diarrhea jokes?"[23]). He has said, "That inside voice is my connection with the audience".[13]
In an interview with theDuluth News-Tribune, he explained that he began developing the voice as a teenager, when he disarmed people by talking for them in their presence.[24]He said he also used it to fend off hecklers earlier in his career, when comedy clubs were more "combative".[24]He cursed early in his career, and added cursing to his comedy albumDoing My Timeat the request of his label, in the hopes of drawing more teens.[25]He has now largely removed profanity from his routine, as he feels his subject matter doesn't lend itself to cursing and that it reduced the effort he put into crafting his jokes.[25][26]
In 2004, Gaffigan's stand-up material was featured inComedy Central's animated seriesShorties Watchin' Shorties. In October 2005, he filmed a liveComedy Centralspecial that aired the following January,[7]and became the comedy album/DVDBeyond the Pale. The routine consisted primarily of material regarding food and American eating habits, and the comedian unknowingly predicted a future menu item atDunkin Donuts—the "glazed donut breakfast sandwich"—while commenting on the future of America's eating habits.[27]His 2009 albumKing Babywas also a television special filmed inAustin, Texas, at the end of his "The Sexy Tour". Comedy Central releasedKing Babyon DVD. In a March 2009 interview onAnytime with Bob Kushell, Gaffigan defended his naming of the tour, stating that he thought it would be funny that parents would be unsure about whether to bring their teenage children to the show.[28]Four years later, on March 14, 2013, Gaffigan was named the "King of Clean" by theWall Street Journal.[29]
On February 25, 2012, Gaffigan taped a one-hour stand-up special—Mr. Universe—at theWarner TheaterinWashington, D.C.;[30]it was nominated for a Grammy.[12]He announced that, based on the business model used byLouis C.K.'sLive at the Beacon Theater, the stand-up would be available online through his website for $5, with 20% of the total proceeds going to theBob Woodruff Foundation,[31]an organization that provides support to military veterans.[32]In 2012, he was among the top-ten grossing comics in the US, according to Pollstar.[12]
Gaffigan filmed his 2014 comedy special titledJim Gaffigan: ObsessedatBoston'sWilbur Theateron January 18, 2014.[33]Obsessedpremiered onComedy Centralon April 27 becoming the most watched stand-up comedy special of the year for the network.[34]The accompanying album, also titledObsessed, debuted at number 11 on theBillboard200and number 1 on the Billboard Comedy Album charts.[35]2015 saw him embark on a headlining tour, culminating in a winter show atMadison Square Garden.[11]

Gaffigan is widely noted as aneverymanand a clean comic;[12][42]some of his signature routines regardHot Pockets,[42][43]cake, andbacon.[23]His tendency to avoid profanity has drawn mixed responses. One critic compared him toFull House-eraBob Saget(who starred in the 1990s family show), which Gaffigan took as an insult.[25]Hampton Stevens inThe Atlanticwrote that Gaffigan "champions a vital element to standup that[Lenny] Brucehad taken away—the indispensable, but apparently forgotten idea that comedians have no obligation to be provocative, topical, socially conscious, or anything else but funny."[23]
I did my set, I walked off stage and they said the executive producer wants to meet you up in his office. I thought maybe it was going to be something good. I thought maybe Dave wants me to be a writer. But they wanted me to develop my ownshow.
As Gaffigan's comedy career stalled in the 1990s, a friend suggested he audition for commercials, a move that turned out to be profitable.[7]He has appeared in over 200 TV commercials,[25]ranging fromRolling RocktoSaturntoChryslerandESPN.

Damiano.[53]Reflecting on the incident in an interview forThe Daily Beast, Gaffigan said, "There's no greater sin in the stand-up world than thievery...So you do not want to be associated with thievery," but added, "I don't have any hard feelings about it because I don't think people think I had anything to do with it."[11]
In the 2010s, Gaffigan, his wife, andPeter Tolanbegan to develop material for a show based loosely on their own life.
