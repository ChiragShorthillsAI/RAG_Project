The Good Liaris a 2019crime thrillerfilm directed and produced byBill Condonand written byJeffrey Hatcher, based on the 2015 novel of the same name by Nicholas Searle. It starsIan McKellenas a career con artist who meets a wealthy widow (Helen Mirren) online, and then discovers that his plan to steal her fortune has unexpected roadblocks.
The film premiered at theBFI Southbankin London on October 28, 2019. It was released byWarner Bros. Picturesin the United Kingdom on November 8, 2019, and in the United States on November 15, 2019. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $33 million against a budget of $10 million.
In 2009London, ageing con artist Roy Courtnay's latest target is Betty McLeish, a recently widowed woman who has savings in excess of£2 million. Feigning a bad knee, Roy manipulates Betty into allowing him to stay at her house. He later encourages Betty to open a joint offshore investment account with him. Simultaneously, Roy and his business partner Vincent run an investment scam with theirmarkBryn and his associate by employing fake Russian investors. One of the pretend Russians, actually a butcher, demands a greater cut of the take; in response, Roy orders thugs to break the butcher's hand. Realising that he was robbed, Bryn follows Roy during his date with Betty. Upon spotting Bryn, Roy sends Betty into the shops before luring him intoCharing Cross tube station. There, Roy stabs Bryn and then shoves him into the path of an incoming train, killing him.
Roy and Betty later go on holiday toBerlin. Betty's grandson Stephen takes the couple to a flat that Roy recognises. Stephen reveals that "Roy Courtnay"— a young British Army officer — was killed there in 1948 by a Nazi war criminal whom he was tracking, according to Soviet records. Roy narrates an elaborate story of his mission in Germany and explains at first that Hans Taub was his German translator. The mission ended in Hans's death. When Stephen refuses to believe his story, Roy is forced to confess that he is Hans, and that he stole Roy's identity so that he could leave Germany and reinvent himself. Betty accepts his explanation and dismisses Stephen's objections.
Roy and Betty plan to transfer their money into the joint account. Vincent suggests to Roy that he leave at least some of the money for Betty to help with her medical condition, but Roy dismisses the idea and insists that he will leave Betty financially defrauded just like his previous victims. Vincent complies and later participates in the transactions necessary for the couple to transfer their money into the joint account. However, after leaving Betty and returning to his flat, Roy discovers that he no longer has the keypad needed to access the account. Roy returns to Betty's house to reclaim it, only to find Betty waiting for him and that all the house contents have been removed.
Betty attempts to force a confession out of Roy, before revealing that her identity and personal history are all fake. Her real name is Lili Schroeder and she has met Roy before, in 1943, when they were both German teenagers and Hans was tutoring her in English. On their last session, after trying to kiss one of her sisters, Hans raped Lili. After her parents dismissed him, because of the kiss, from continuing his lessons, Hans denounced Lili's father as a traitor and he was executed by the Nazis. This drove Lili's mother to commitsuicide. Later, Lili's sisters died in an explosion two weeks before the death ofAdolf Hitler. After the war ended, Lili suffered at the hands of the Russians, learning to be a good liar for survival. Eventually, she made her way to England.
Lili has been aware of Roy's plan to con her all along. Stephen, who was actually the boyfriend of Lili's real grandson Michael, tracked Roy/Hans's criminal history and they confirmed his identity in a DNA test using a locket from Betty/Lili's childhood that contained a piece of Hans's hair. Vincent betrayed Roy after being confronted with her knowledge of their crimes.
Betty takes all of Roy's money out of their joint account, leaving him only enough money to pay back the victims of his earlier con. As she prepares to leave the house, Roy locks the door and attacks her – but she fends him off before he is confronted by Bryn's associate and the butcher. Betty then leaves the house as Roy, refusing to pay his clients back, is consequently beaten up. Weeks later, Roy, having suffered a stroke during the fight, is in hospital, unable to speak or move. Vincent pays him a visit to gloat and bother him. Meanwhile, Betty lives happily with her extended family.
In March 2018, it was announced thatBill Condonwould direct the film, withIan McKellenandHelen Mirrencast in the leading roles.[6][7]In April 2018,Russell ToveyandJim Carterjoined the cast.[8]
Principal production commenced on April 23, 2018, inLondon, England. The film was also shot inBerlin, Germany.[9]
The film's world premiere was held on October 28, 2019, at theBFI Southbankin London.[10]It was released on November 8, 2019, in the United Kingdom, and on November 15, 2019, in the United States.[11]
The Good Liarhas grossed $17.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $16.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $33.4 million,[5]against a production budget of $10 million.[4]
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongsideCharlie's AngelsandFord v Ferrari, and was projected to gross around $5 million from 2,439 theaters in its opening weekend.[12]It made $1.6 million on its first day and went on to debut to $5.6 million, finishing seventh at the box office.[3]It fell 40% to $3.6 million in its second weekend, finishing in tenth.[13]
Rotten Tomatoesreported that 63% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "The Good Liaris less than the sum of its prestigious parts, but Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren keep the proceedings consistently watchable."[14]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[15]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed atPostTrakgave it 4 out of 5 stars, with 56% saying they would definitely recommend it.[3]The Guardianincluded it in a list of the most underrated films of 2019.[16]
In his review forThe Wall Street JournalJoe Morgenstern wrote, ""The Good Liar" is calculation from arch start to hollow finish... This film grows grim enough to be a companion piece."[17]Ben Kenigsberg ofThe New York Timescommented, "The sleight of hand "The Good Liar" tries to pull off might be easier to keep hidden on the page. As it progresses, the film reveals complications (it plays particularly dubious tricks with the way it parcels out flashbacks to the 1940s) and a motive that might as well have been picked out of a hat. The finale could be written with entirely different details, and almost no scene preceding it would have to change. The real good liar is whoever convinced Mirren and McKellen to class up such thin and arbitrary material."[18]Peter Sobczynski writing forRogerEbert.comgave the movie two and half stars out of four and stated, "...it quickly becomes apparent that this is one of those stories where nothing is quite as it seems, and leading to a shocking revelation that most will see coming, at least in the broad strokes. A film of this sort needs an airtight plot—or at least airtight enough to keep you from questioning things as it is running—but there are a few too many instances in which characters say and do things solely because the plot requires them to do so."[19]Sandra HallofThe Sydney Morning Heraldgave the film three and half stars out of five and noted, "...as a result, there's not much suspense. It's an enthralling exercise but a peculiarly cerebral one – a psychological thriller without the thrills."[20]The Guardian's Wendy Ide gave the film three stars out of five, stating, "...The Good Liaris at its sparky best when Mirren and McKellen are on screen, waltzing smoothly through a plot that feels like a Russian doll of deeper and deeper deceptions. Flashes of violence are effectively jarring when juxtaposed with the chintzy cosiness of much of the film. Less successful are two thudding, lead-weight flashbacks, which disgorge chunks of exposition and quash some of the fun in McKellen and Mirren's deft double act."[21]Elizabeth Weitzman ofTheWrapsaid, "There's only one truly unpredictable twist in "The Good Liar," and that's the disappointment audiences are likely to feel when they leave the theater."[22]
The Adelaide Reviewgave the movie 7/10 points, noting, "Helen and Ian's first film together (although they've previously appeared as a double-act on the stage), this has an especially complex and even unpleasant performance by him, but she's no slouch too, and it's good to see Tovey holding his own in scenes alongside these two 'national treasures'. And yes, as Helen's Betty would say, "It's so English!""[23]In his review forRolling Stone, David Fear gave the film two stars out of five and wrote, "The real question is: Are you willing to endure all of that random swerving for the simple pleasure of these performers' company? Both actors are, unsurprisingly, bending over backwards here to sell these characters and establish enough screen chemistry to smooth over a lot of rough patches... They play off each other beautifully despite the material, and they get a chance to indulge in the aforementioned range of sound and fury. Yes, you would watch these two in virtually anything. You just wish it wasn't this. They deserve something sturdier and far less head-slappingly preposterous, and that's the truth."[24]Jon Frosch ofThe Hollywood Reporteradded, "An example of the kind of middlebrow, classily accoutered "cinema for adults" that's grown rare in the Age of Marvel, the film may pique the interest of viewers of a certain age; there's a comfy pleasure in watching these two pros patter back and forth in plummy accents, clutching mugs of tea or sipping flutes of champagne. YetThe Good Liar's sophistication is nothing if not skin-deep. For all its nasty twists and turns, its fake-outs and flashbacks and cheekily preposterous pile-up of double-crosses, this story of an elderly con man and the wealthy widow he targets feels fatally devoid of danger. Square, tame and tidy as the London-area house kept by Mirren's primly elegant, creamy-complexioned septuagenarian, The Good Liar is a work of skill but little spark."[25]Le Newsgave the film three stars out of four, stating. "Two superb actors from the grand culture of English drama – Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen – are enough reason to pull you into this intriguing tale of deception... If you're looking for quality entertainment with an absorbing script, multiple twists and great acting, this is your film. Not a masterpiece, but captivating and satisfying."[26]
David Hughes ofEmpiregave the film three stars out of five, commenting, "...even if you know what's coming, there's joy in watching two flawless performances from these much-loved veteran actors, relishing every nuance of their characters, and every moment of their time on screen. They're so good, in fact, that the film flags every time one or both of them are off screen, such as during the flashback sequences, with which a more daring adaptation might have dispensed... It may be a shaggy-dog story, with occasional lapses into melodrama, but Mirren and McKellen are on sparkling form, and when a film aimed primarily at pensioners employs both the C-word and gory injury detail, you can't accuse it of being boring."[27]David Ehrlich ofIndieWirestated, "...it's Mirren who's ultimately asked to carry this movie across the finish line, and she does so with oodles of her signature elan. It's a rare actor who can split the difference between an airport thriller and a historical reckoning — who's able to conflate the silly with the serious in a way that completely erases the difference — but Mirren is more than up to the challenge. The final stretches of Condon's film are so ludicrous that you almost feel swindled for caring about the movie until that point, but Mirren grounds one plot twist after another with the gravity of her conviction (and a little help from Carter Burwell's lilting, uneasy, "Mr. Holmes"-esque score). "The Good Liar" may not have much to say about redemption, entrapment, or the fibs that can hold a friendship together, but the past is only so important to a wicked little thriller that delights in the moment at hand."[28]Jess Layt ofHawkesbury Gazettegave the movie 5.5/10 points, commenting, "This is a story gives older actors some genuine character work, an actual story and motivations and a life. That being said, the wayThe Good Liarplays out in its final act feels like a bit of a hoodwink in itself. Audiences have been following these characters for a good chunk of film, only to have odd backstories suddenly revealed for which there is no apparent foreshadowing...The Good Liar, much like its protagonist, talks big game but is really just confused about its identity and place in the world."[29]

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]
Warner Bros. owns some shared universes. Some of them are based on books and comics, including some of the highest grossing IP's in the movie industry.

William Condon(born October 22, 1955) is an American director and screenwriter. Condon is known for writing and/or directing numerous successful and acclaimed films includingGods and Monsters,Chicago,Kinsey,Dreamgirls,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2, andBeauty and the Beast.[1]He has received two nominations for theAcademy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay,Gods and MonstersandChicago, winning for the former.
Condon was born inNew York Cityon October 22, 1955,[2]the son of a policedetective,[3]and was raised in anIrish Catholicfamily.[4][5]He attendedRegis High SchoolandColumbia College of Columbia University, graduating in 1976 with a degree in philosophy.[4]
Two films had a significant impact of Condon's early life. At the age of twelve, he found himself drawn to screenplay writing with his first viewing ofBonnie and Clyde.[6]In college he sawSweet Charity(1969), which led to "a lifelong love affair with movies that are reviled and rejected in their time."[4]
After completing college, Condon worked as a journalist for film magazines, includingAmerican FilmandMillimeter. In 1981, he won "the world's most difficult film trivia quiz" sponsored byThe Village Voice.[7]
His career as a filmmaker began with screenplays for theindependent featureStrange Behavior(1981), an homage to the pulp horror films of the 1950s,[8]and thescience-fictionfeatureStrange Invaders(1983), which starredNancy AllenandWallace Shawn.[9]
His directorial debut wasSister, Sister(1987), an eerieSouthern Gothicmystery starringEric StoltzandJennifer Jason Leigh. Test screenings led to major changes to the film, which still proved a critical failure that set back Condon's career.[10]
Condon emerged a few years later directing a series of made-for-TV thrillers, includingMurder 101(1991), which earned Condon and co-writer Roy Johansen a 1992Edgar Awardfor their screenplay.[11]During this period he also wrote the screenplay for the thrillerF/X2(1991), which was directed by Australian directorRichard Franklin.[12]
In 1994, he directed the television movieThe Man Who Wouldn't Die,which was met with mixed reviews.[13]He directedCandyman: Farewell to the Flesh(1995), a sequel toBernard Rose's1992 horror film. It was a critical and commercial failure.[14]Reminded years later of this phase of his career, Condon said: "It's hard to be lower on the totem pole than being the director for a sequel to a horror movie."[4]
Condon wrote and directedGods and Monsters(1998), which was based on a novel byChristopher Bram. His screenplay won theAcademy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.The New York Timessaid Condon "may have been the most stunned person at the Academy Awards when his name was announced as the winner for the best adapted screenplay. He has struggled for years in Hollywood as a screenwriter and journalist and is unaccustomed to the hoopla that is now around him."[15]He was nominated for the same award for his screenplay forChicago, based on the Broadway musical of thesame name.[16]He received a second Edgar Award for hisChicagoscreenplay as well.[17]
In 2004 he wrote and directed the filmKinsey, chronicling the life of the controversial sex researcherAlfred Kinsey. InThe New York Times,A.O. Scottwrote that "Bill Condon's smart, stirring [film] has a lot to say on the subject of sex, which it treats with sobriety, sensitivity and a welcome measure of humor." He continued: "I can't think of another movie that has dealt with sex so knowledgeably and, at the same time, made the pursuit of knowledge seem so sexy. There are some explicit images and provocative scenes, but it is your intellect that is most likely to be aroused.... Mr. Condon's great achievement is to turn Kinsey's complicated and controversial career into a grand intellectual drama."[18]
In 2005, he received theStephen F. Kolzak Awardat theGLAADMedia Awards.[19]
Condon wrote the screenplay for and directedDreamgirls, an adaptation of the acclaimed Broadway musical of thesame name. It was released in December 2006.

Condon directed both parts ofThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn(2011 and 2012), adapted from the fourth and final novel inThe Twilight SagabyStephenie Meyer. He was twice nominated for aRazzie for Worst Directorfor these films, winning forPart 2.[22]
Condon directedThe Fifth Estate(2013), a thriller aboutWikiLeaksstarringBenedict Cumberbatch. He said he chose the project for a change of pace and liked its non-ideological approach to a very complex subject. He saw it "in the great tradition of journalistic thrillers".[23]It received mixed responses from critics and underperformed at the box office.[24]
In late 2013, he directed a revised version of the 1997 stage musicalSide Showat theLa Jolla Playhouse. A production of this revision played in June and July 2014 at theKennedy Center.Charles Isherwooddescribed it inThe New York Timesas "a full-scale reimagining" of the musical that involved "the addition and subtraction of several songs ..., the reordering of others", and new dialogue contributed by Condon.[25]That production received excellent reviews when it moved to Broadway in the fall, but it proved a failure at the box office and closed after just seven weeks.[26]
In 2015, Condon directedMr. HolmesstarringIan McKellen. Condon noted its similarity toGods and Monsters, not only because of its lead actor but because "[b]oth movies are about aging and mortality. You have a celebrated man facing the decline of his public image."[27]
Condon directed the 2017Disney'slive action film adaptation,based onthe animated 1991 filmBeauty and the Beast, starringEmma WatsonandDan Stevens.[1]A few weeks before the film's scheduled release on March 17, 2017, Condon announced that one character, LeFou, has "a nice, exclusively gay moment", which resulted in an "internet meltdown" of contrasting support and condemnation.[28]

Mirren was born Helen Lydia Mironoff on 26 July 1945[9][10]atQueen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospitalin theHammersmithdistrict of London,[11][12]to anEnglishmother andRussianfather.[13]Her mother, Kathleen "Kitty" Alexandrina Eva Matilda (née Rogers; 1908–1996), was a working-class woman fromWest Ham, the thirteenth of fourteen children born to a butcher whose own father was the butcher toQueen Victoria.[13][14]Mirren's father, Vasily Petrovich Mironoff (1913–1980), was a member of an old exiled family of theRussian nobilitydating back to the first half of the 15th century; he was taken to England when he was two by his father, Pyotr Vasilievich Mironov (1880–1957).[13][15]Pyotr Vasilievich Mironov owned a large family estate near Gzhatsk (nowGagarin) in theRussian Empire.[16]His mother, Mirren's great-grandmother, was Countess Lydia AndreevnaKamenskaya(1848–1928), an aristocrat and a descendant ofCount Mikhail Fedotovich Kamensky, a prominent Russian general in theNapoleonic Wars.[10][17]Her grandfather, Pyotr Vasilievich Mironov also served as a colonel in theImperial Russian Armyand fought in the 1904Russo-Japanese War. He later became a diplomat in the service ofNicholas IIand was negotiating an arms deal in Britain when he and his family were stranded by theRussian Revolutionin 1917.[18][19]He settled in London and became a cab driver to support his family.[20]
Vasily Mironoff also played the viola with theLondon Philharmonic OrchestrabeforeWorld War II.[13]He was an ambulance driver during the war, and served in theEast End of Londonduringthe Blitz.[21]He and Kathleen Rogers married in Hammersmith in 1938, and at some point before 1951 he anglicised his first name to Basil.[22]Shortly after Helen's birth, her father left the orchestra and returned to driving a cab to support the family. He later worked as a driving-test examiner, then became a civil servant with theMinistry of Transport.[9][13]In 1951, he changed the family name to Mirren bydeed poll.[22]Mirren considers her upbringing to have been "very anti-monarchist".[23]She was the second of three children; she has an older sister Katherine ("Kate"; born 1942) and had a younger brother Peter Basil (1947–2002).[24]Her paternal cousin wasTania Mallet, a model andBond girl.[25]Mirren was brought up inLeigh-on-Sea, Essex.[26]
Mirren attended Hamlet Court primary school inWestcliff-on-Sea, where she had the lead role in a school production ofHansel and Gretel,[27][28]andSt Bernard's High School for GirlsinSouthend-on-Sea, where she also acted in school productions. She subsequently attended a teaching college, theNew College of Speech and Dramain London, "housed withinAnna Pavlova's old home, Ivy House" onNorth End RoadinGolders Green. At the age of eighteen, she passed the audition for theNational Youth Theatre(NYT); and at twenty, she playedCleopatrain the NYT production ofAntony and Cleopatraat theOld Vic, a role which she says "launched my career" and led to her signing with agentAl Parker.[29][30]
As a result of her work for the National Youth Theatre, Mirren was invited to join theRoyal Shakespeare Company(RSC). While with the RSC, she played Castiza inTrevor Nunn's 1966 staging ofThe Revenger's Tragedy, Diana inAll's Well That Ends Well(1967), Cressida inTroilus and Cressida(1968), Rosalind[31]inAs You Like It(1968), Julia inThe Two Gentlemen of Verona(1970), Tatiana inGorky'sEnemiesat theAldwych(1971), and the title role inMiss JulieatThe Other Place(1971). She also appeared in four productions, directed byBraham Murrayfor Century Theatre at the University Theatre in Manchester, between 1965 and 1967.[32]
In 1970, the director and producerJohn Goldschmidtmade a documentary film,Doing Her Own Thing, about Mirren during her time with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Made forATV, it was shown on the ITV network in the UK. In 1972 and 1973, Mirren worked withPeter Brook's International Centre for Theatre Research and joined the group's tour in North Africa and the US, during which they createdThe Conference of the Birds.

In 1976, she appeared withLaurence Olivier,Alan BatesandMalcolm McDowellin a production ofHarold Pinter'sThe Collectionas part of theLaurence Olivier Presentsseries.
Sally Beaumanreported, in her 1982 history of the RSC, that Mirren—while appearing in Nunn'sMacbeth(1974), and in a letter toThe Guardiannewspaper—had sharply criticised both theNational Theatreand the RSC for their lavish production expenditure, declaring it "unnecessary and destructive to the art of the Theatre", and adding, "The realms of truth, emotion and imagination reached for in acting a great play have become more and more remote, often totally unreachable across an abyss of costume and technicalities..." This started a big debate, and led to a question in parliament. There were no discernible repercussions for this rebuke of the RSC.[33][34]
At theWest End'sRoyal Court Theatrein September 1975, she played the role of a rock star named Maggie inTeeth 'n' Smiles, a musical play byDavid Hare; she reprised the role the following year in a revival of the play atWyndham's Theatrein May 1976.

That same year she also won acclaim for her performance in the title role ofJohn Webster'sThe Duchess of Malfi, a production of Manchester'sRoyal Exchange Theatrewhich was later transferred toThe RoundhouseinChalk Farm, London. Reviewing her portrayal forThe Sunday Telegraph,Francis Kingwrote: "Miss Mirren never leaves it in doubt that even in her absences, this ardent, beautiful woman is the most important character of the story." In her performance as Moll Cutpurse inThe Roaring Girl—at theRoyal Shakespeare Theatrein January 1983, and at theBarbican Theatrein April 1983—she was described as having "swaggered through the action with radiant singularity of purpose, filling in areas of light and shade that evenThomas MiddletonandThomas Dekkeromitted." –Michael Coveney,Financial Times, April 1983.[35]During this time, Mirren took roles inCaligula(1979),[36][37]The Long Good Friday(1980)—co-starring withBob Hoskinsin what was her breakthrough film role,[38]Excalibur(1981),2010(1984),White Nights(1985),The Mosquito Coast(1986),Pascali's Island(1988) andWhen the Whales Came(1989). Mirren's television performances includeCousin Bette(1971);As You Like It(1979);Blue Remembered Hills(1979); andThe Twilight Zoneepisode "Dead Woman's Shoes" (1985).
At the beginning of 1989, Mirren co-starred withBob Peckat theYoung Vicin the London premiere of theArthur Millerdouble-bill,Two Way Mirror, performances which prompted Miller to remark: "What is so good about English actors is that they are not afraid of the open expression of large emotions. British actors like to speak. In London, there's a much more open-hearted kind of exchange between stage and audience" (interview bySheridan Morley:The Times11 January 1989).[39]InElegy for a Ladyshe played the svelte proprietress of a classy boutique, while as the blonde hooker inSome Kind of Love Storyshe was "clad in a Freudian slip and shifting easily from waif-like vulnerability to sexual aggression, giving the role a breathy Monroesque quality".[40]
Mirren is known for her role as detective Jane Tennison in the widely viewedPrime Suspect, a multiple award-winning television drama series that was noted for its high quality and popularity. Her portrayal of Tennison won herthree consecutive British Academy Television Awards for Best Actressbetween 1992 and 1994 (making her one of four actors to have received three consecutiveBAFTA TV Awardsfor a role, alongsideRobbie Coltrane,Julie WaltersandMichael Gambon).[41]Primarily due toPrime Suspect, in 2006 Mirren came 29th onITV's poll ofTV's 50 Greatest Starsvoted by the British public.[42]A further stage breakthrough came in 1994, in anYvonne Arnaud Theatreproduction bound for the West End, whenBill Brydencast her as Natalya Petrovna inIvan Turgenev'sA Month in the Country.

InTeaching Mrs. Tingle(1999), she plays sadistic history teacher Mrs. Eve Tingle.[45]In 1998, Mirren playedCleopatratoAlan Rickman'sAntonyinAntony and Cleopatraat theNational Theatre. The production received poor reviews;The Guardiancalled it "plodding spectacle rarely informed by powerful passion", whileThe Daily Telegraphsaid "the crucial sexual chemistry on which any great production ultimately depends is fatally absent".[46]In 2000Nicholas Hytner, who had worked with Mirren on the film version ofThe Madness of King George, cast her as Lady Torrance in his revival ofTennessee Williams'Orpheus Descendingat theDonmar Warehousein London. Michael Billington, reviewing forThe Guardian, described her performance as "an exemplary study of an immigrant woman who has acquired a patina of resilient toughness but who slowly acknowledges her sensuality."[47]
She portrayedAyn Randin the television film,The Passion of Ayn Rand(1999), where her performance won her anEmmy;Door to Door(2002); andThe Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone(2003). At the National Theatre in November 2003 she again won praise playing Christine Mannon ("defiantly cool, camp and skittish",Evening Standard; "glows with mature sexual allure",Daily Telegraph) in a revival ofEugene O'Neill'sMourning Becomes Electradirected byHoward Davies. "This production was one of the best experiences of my professional life, The play was four and a half hours long, and I have never known that kind of response from an audience ... It was the serendipity of a beautifully cast play, with great design and direction, It will be hard to be in anything better."[28]She played the title role inJean Racine'sPhèdreat the National in 2009, in a production directed byNicholas Hytner. The production was also staged at theEpidaurus amphitheatreon 11 and 12 July 2009.

I was only doing what the [casting] agent asked me – and for this I get reviled! Helen's a lovely person, she's a great actor and I'm a huge fan, but her memory of that moment is a little flawed."[62]In 2010, Mirren appeared in five films.

But when the offer came from this fringe theatre group, the Brighton Combination, to leave university and join them for five quid a week, it was like a door opening, and there wasn't a moment's hesitation. I walked through that door and never looked back. I have never earned a penny from doing anything apart from acting. I have never had another job."[4]
