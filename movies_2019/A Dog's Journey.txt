In the previous film, Bailey reunited with his longtime owner Ethan after being reincarnated as a new dog. Now aSt. Bernard/Australian Shepherd, Bailey lives with Ethan, Ethan's wife Hannah, Gloria (the widow of Hannah's son and Ethan's stepson Henry), and her 2-year-old daughter CJ on their farm inMichigan. Gloria's suspicious nature leads her to move out with CJ. Shortly after, Ethan discovers a tumor in Bailey's stomach. Before Bailey iseuthanized, Ethan asks him to take care of CJ once he is reincarnated again.
Nine years later, Bailey, reincarnated as a femalebeaglenamed Molly, sees a now 11-year-old CJ with her best friend Trent Mahoney and his parents, who are adopting the former’s brother Rocky. Molly runs outside to CJ, who secretly adopts her. Gloria reluctantly allows CJ to keep Molly to compensate for her neglectful parenting.
CJ and Molly grow increasingly close over the years, along with Trent and Rocky. Now a teenager, CJ tells Trent she wants to drop out of high school and move toNew York Citywith her deceased father Henry's insurance settlement to become a musician. CJ begins to date a boy named Shane, who Molly distrusts. Attending a party that gets busted by police forunderage drinking, CJ is sentenced to community service where Molly learns how todetect cancer.
Days after she breaks up with him, Shane assaults CJ, prompting Molly to bite him. While drunk, Gloria responds nonchalantly to CJ's distress and reveals she spent all of Henry's settlement money, prompting CJ to leave town with Molly. On the way out, they are stalked and tail-ended by Shane, which causes her car to flip, killing Molly.
Molly is reincarnated as a maleEnglish mastiffnamed Big Dog, who lives with a convenience store owner inPennsylvania. One day, CJ visits the shop and is lovingly greeted by Big Dog. He mistakenly believes that CJ recognizes him, is heartbroken when she leaves without him, and spends the rest of that life missing her.
Big Dog is reincarnated as a maleBiewer Terriernamed Max, who is adopted by CJ. While CJ is working as a dog walker, Max detects Trent's scent down the hall and pulls her toward his door. CJ and Trent reconnect with each other. Max is eager to reunite CJ and Trent, despite each of them being in live-in relationships of their own, and the fact that Rocky is gone. Max intentionally misbehaves around CJ's boyfriend, Barry, after which they break up and CJ moves out with Max. They stay with various friends of CJ's before Max spots Trent and his girlfriend on the street, and Trent offers his guest room to CJ.
Remembering how to diagnose cancer during his life as Molly, Max signals to CJ that he detects it on Trent, and CJ urges Trent to see a doctor. The doctor confirms, and Trent beginschemo. His girlfriend leaves him, so CJ becomes his primary caretaker. Once Trent is cancer-free, he urges CJ to accept a meeting with Gloria, who is sober. Gloria tearfully apologizes for her abusive nature and gives CJ some of the things sent from Ethan and Hannah. They inspire CJ to write more songs and to perform, overcoming her longstandingstage frightand beginning her musical career.
Trent encourages CJ to go on a road trip with him and Max to her grandparents’ farm, where she reunites with Ethan and Hannah for the first time since she was a toddler. Ethan recognizes Max as Bailey and tells CJ of the dog's reincarnations, proving it by having Max perform a trick that only Bailey would know. CJ and Trent then confess their love for one another and praise Max/Bailey for reuniting them.
CJ and Trent marry, and shortly after CJ releases her first music album, they have a son named Saint. Gloria reconciles with her daughter and in-laws, reuniting the family. Ethan dies of natural causes, surrounded by Max and the rest of his family. Max later ages and dies as well. The final scene shows Bailey running through a grassy field, morphing backwards through his previous incarnations, before crossing theRainbow Bridgeand reuniting with Ethan in heaven.

And cocaine at that time was considered harmless. You know. I remember magazine articles inPeoplemagazineof doctors saying it is not addicting. It is just—alcohol is worse. So I think we all fell into that. But that's not the way it was."
