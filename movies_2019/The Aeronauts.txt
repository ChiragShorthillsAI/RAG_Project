The Aeronautsis a 2019biographicaladventure filmdirected byTom Harperand written byJack Thorne, from a story co-written by Thorne and Harper. The film is based on the 2013 bookFalling Upwards: How We Took to the AirbyRichard Holmes.[8]Produced byTodd Lieberman,David Hoberman, and Harper, the film starsEddie Redmayne,Felicity Jones,Himesh PatelandTom Courtenay.[9]
The film had its world premiere at theTelluride Film Festivalon 30 August 2019, followed by a showing at the2019Toronto International Film Festival.[10][11]It was released in the United Kingdom on 4 November 2019, and in the United States on 6 December 2019. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, but was the subject of controversy for its historical revisionism of one of the two protagonists.
In 1862London, pilot Amelia Wren and scientistJames Glaisherarrive for the launch of the largestballoonever constructed.[N 1]Despite being haunted by a vision of her late husband Pierre, Amelia keeps up the brave front and the balloon launches to a cheering crowd. In a flashback, James appears before theRoyal Societyand explains his theory that the weather can be predicted but his fellow scientists mock him and refuse to finance his studies. Returning home, he talks to his parents, who try to persuade him to pursue another avenue of science. On the balloon, James and Amelia start rising through the cloud layer. They soon run into a violent storm which sends the balloon spinning. In a flashback, Amelia is persuaded by her sister Antonia to attend a society function. There, Amelia is approached by James and he asks if she would be willing to pilot his balloon in a privately funded expedition while he attempts to prove his theories, to which she agrees.
Although James suffers a head injury while being thrown around, he and Amelia make it through the storm and continue rising. James releases the first of five pigeons carrying messages stating their altitude along with other scientific readings in case they don't survive. They discover an air current which is home to a group of butterflies, confirming a theory of James' friend John Trew that insects can travel on air currents. In a flashback, as James practices for the flight, Amelia visits to tell him she has changed her mind. Eventually, the balloon exceeds 23,000 ft (7,000 m), beating the record for the highest altitude. (Glaisher estimated they reached about 37,000 ft (11,000 m) in elevation, but was later calculated to be about 29,500 ft (9,000 m).)[12]Amelia is shocked to learn that James didn't bring any clothes suitable for the rapidly decreasing temperature and decides to start descending. James refuses and the two argue. Amelia agrees to keep rising but makes it clear to James that they'll have to start descending soon.
In a flashback, John goes to see Amelia, telling her that she has an obligation to advance the cause of science. Amelia then goes to Pierre's grave to reflect. When it begins to snow (which John told her James had predicted), she decides to go with him after all. In the balloon, James starts experiencinghypoxiafrom the altitude but insists they continue and tries to stop Amelia from descending. He relents only when Amelia tells him the story of how Pierre sacrificed himself to save her during a balloon flight. Amelia discovers the gas release valve on top of the balloon is frozen. As James falls unconscious, she has no choice but to climb up the outside of the balloon and open the valve from the top. With frostbite setting in on her hands, she struggles to wedge her boot in the valve, causing a slow release of the gas. Amelia loses consciousness and topples over the side but is saved by her rope tether.
When she awakens, Amelia manages to swing back to the balloon and rouse James. As they continue to descend, snow begins to hover around them, indicating that the balloon is collapsing from the loss of too much gas. They manage to close the gas release and throw everything they can over the side, including all of James' equipment. When this doesn't work, they climb into the framework and release the basket. Realising that Amelia is ready to sacrifice herself to save him, James is able to convert the rest of the balloon into a parachute, which slows their descent. They crash through trees and hit the ground hard, with Amelia being dragged along behind the balloon. She wakes and calls for James, who staggers towards her. Both are injured but euphoric that they managed to survive, setting a new human flight altitude record of 37,000 ft (11,300 m). James' findings prove the existence of layers in the atmosphere, paving the way for the first weather forecasts and he and Amelia build a new balloon so they can continue to conduct research together.
In December 2016,Amazon Studiospurchased the film rights toJack Thorne's spec script.[13]In mid-2018,Felicity JonesandEddie Redmaynewere confirmed to star in the film.[14][15]They were reunited afterThe Theory of Everything(2014), directed byJames Marsh, as their past work and real-life friendship would help them in this new collaboration.[16]
Principal photographybegan in early August 2018, inWest London Film Studios, with George Steel serving as cinematographer.[17]Filming locations in England included theRoyal Naval College, Greenwich,Regent's Park, London,Claydon House,Buckinghamshire, theBodleian LibraryinOxford,Wrotham Park, London[17]and The Historic Dockyard Chatham inKent.[18]
Key action sequences inThe Aeronautswere designed forIMAXand feature an expanded aspect ratio for both IMAX and select Premium Large Format cinemas.[19]
The film is based on an amalgam of the flights detailed inRichard Holmes' 2013 bookFalling Upwards: How We Took to the Air(ISBN978-0-00-738692-5). The most significant balloon flight depicted inThe Aeronautsis based on the 5 September 1862 flight of British aeronautsJames GlaisherandHenry Coxwellwhosecoal gas-filled balloon broke the worldflight altitude record, reaching 30,000 to 36,000 ft (9,000 to 11,000 m).[20]However, while Glaisher appears in the film, Coxwell has been replaced by Amelia, a fictional character.[21]
The real flight started from Wolverhampton on the site of the town gas works and ended in the Gorsebrook area of the town. The film moves the action to London.[citation needed]
A report inThe Daily Telegraphquotes Keith Moore, Head of Library at the Royal Society, as saying, "It's a great shame that Henry [Coxwell] isn't portrayed because he performed very well and saved the life of a leading scientist". Moore then criticised the film's fictional female protagonist, stating “There were so many deserving female scientists of that period who haven't had films made about them. Why not do that instead?"[22]In an interview withThe List, Harper explained that whilst the film was inspired by a number of historical flights, the intention was never to make a documentary and he wanted the film to be reflective of a contemporary audience. He also commented on a gender bias in science, stating "There were female scientists around at the time, but not in the Royal Society... to this day, only eight per cent of the Royal Society is female."[23][24]
Other critics of the film have praised Amelia as an important, aspirational female character.Sasha StoneofAwards Dailywrote thatThe Aeronauts"inspires young girls and nudges the perspectives of young boys... (revealing) that women can be just as excited about taking a hero's journey as any man can."[25]
In addition to Coxwell, real-life individuals who compose Amelia's character include:
Amelia's relationship with husband Pierre is chiefly based on Sophie Blanchard's flights with husbandJean-Pierre Blanchard, while Pierre's death is inspired by that ofThomas Harrison 25 May 1824.[27]
The film had its world premiere at theTelluride Film Festivalon 30 August 2019.[28]It also screened at the2019 Toronto International Film Festivalon 8 September 2019.[29]Entertainment Onegave the film a full theatrical release in the United Kingdom on 4 November, including screenings in4DXand IMAX.[30]Amazon Studios released the film in the United States on 6 December for a limited theatrical run, before debuting it onAmazon Prime Videooutside of the United Kingdom on 20 December 2019.[31]The film was released in China, on November 13, 2020.[32]

Of the 186 locations that did screen it in its opening weekend (6 December 2019) 48 reported a combined gross of around $30,000.[35]IndieWireestimated the film made a total of $185,000 in its opening weekend, an average of $1,000 per-venue.[36]It then made an estimated $100,000 from 85 theatres in its second weekend,[7]before its 20 December streaming debut on Amazon Prime.
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 71% based on 189 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critics consensus states, "Thrilling visuals and the substantial chemistry of its well-matched leads makeThe Aeronautsan adventure well worth taking."[37]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on reviews from 37 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[38]
Todd McCarthy ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "The Aeronautsachieves impressive elevation as a bracing and sympathetic account of two early and very different aviators who together reached literal new heights in a perilous field of endeavor."[39]Fionnuala Halligan ofScreen Internationalwrote about the chemistry of the lead actors and the great craft on display in the film: "With the widest of wide-screens, the most vertiginous of vistas, this hot air balloon takes to the skies and soars."[40]Tomris Laffly ofVarietypraised the visuals and the lead performers: "The duo [of Redmayne and Jones] hand-in-hand elevatesThe Aeronauts...from a flimsy action-adventure to something worth watching on the biggest possible screen, even if it operates on a handful of clichés with little character-based substance to speak of."[41]
Many critics also applauded the film's special effects and visuals.Peter BradshawofThe Guardiannoted the film's "terrific special effects" and "high-anxiety suspense".[42]Eric Kohn ofIndieWirewrote: "When so many supersized blockbusters take the potential of CGI action for granted,The Aeronautsfinds a fresh use for it by turning the exhilaration of discovery into a real visual treat."[43]In a generally positive review, criticBob Mondelloshowed special enthusiasm for the airborne scenes, writing: "I cannot say strongly enough that if you can see it in IMAX, you should see it in IMAX, where if you're even a little bit afraid of heights, it will likely scare you shoutless."[44]

Thorne has been a long-term advocate for the disabled community in the dramatic arts. After he developedcholinergic urticariawhen he was 20 years old, he became allergic to outdoor heat, artificial heat, and his own body heat. This gave him chronic pain that forced him to leave university and spend much of his early twenties in bed.[56]Despite this, he felt unsure whether he could identify as a disabled person; after attending aGraeae Theatre Companyopen day (which he described as the "National Theatre of disability") three years after his diagnosis, he was accepted with open arms. He described the incident as a "coming outmoment" and a "crucial part" of who he is. He has since written disabled dramasThe Hunchback of Notre Dame,The Spastic King,Cast Offs,The Solid Life of Sugar Water,Don't Take My Baby,CripTales, andThen Barbara Met Alan, and has become a patron of the Graeae Theatre Company.
In August 2021, Thorne delivered theEdinburgh TV Festival's prestigiousMacTaggart Lecture.[56]He used the speech to discuss television's power as an "empathy box" in the living room of millions and its failings for neglecting a large and vibrant part of the populace by poorly representing the disabled community. Thorne points to the great suffering of disabled people during theCOVID-19 pandemicin which the media rendered huge amounts of unnecessary deaths acceptable through usage of the term "underlying health condition".[56]The speech also outlined how television industry practice has been discriminatory towards disabled artists, and the dire need for the industry to commit to change, both off-screen and on; alongsideGenevieve Barrand Katie Player, Thorne announced a pressure group called Underlying Health Condition which aims to elevate disabled voices in the industry. Thorne argues that more disabled stories written by disabled people and performed by disabled people would make visible what's invisible in the "empathy box" in the homes of the public and cause change to happen.
On 3 December 2021,Underlying Health Conditionwas launched at an event at theTate Modern, collaborating with other disability organisations such as Disabled Artists Networking Community, the Creative Diversity Network and 1in4 Coalition, to propose a series of requirements and measures to accommodate and support disabled artists in television.[57][58]
This, in turn, lead to the launch of The TV Access Project,[59]or TAP, which has seen 10 of the UK’s biggest broadcasters commit to the full inclusion of Deaf Disabled and/or Neurodivergent Talent by 2030. TAP created best practise guidelines to ensure this inclusion, referred to as the 5As: Anticipate, Ask, Assess, Adjust, Advocate.[60]
Within its first year, TAP delivered 20 sustainable, tangible solutions towards its vision of full inclusion, including launching TAPStars, a programme funded by the broadcasters and streamers who are TAP members to support early-career disabled off-screen talent; introducing an Access To Work pilot scheme to fast-track applications and access provision for freelances, and oversee reimbursements from Access to Work; securing a commitment from all TAP members to fund necessary access costs not covered by Access to Work, over and above the production budget; giving 82 Commissioning Editors and senior leaders from TAP members fundamental 5As training, delivered by CDN; and writing an outline of key access-related roles & responsibilities across productions and commissioning, to be adopted alongside Access Coordinators.[61]
In August 2024, it was announced that all 10 TAP members - theBBC,Channel 4,ITV,Disney+,UKTV,BritBox,Sky UK,Paramount Pictures,STV (TV channel)andAmazon Prime Video- would boycott any studios and production spaces which had not completed the TV Access Project's accessibility audit by August 2025.[62]This audit requires studios to self-assess their own accessibility in 4 key areas: Production buildings, Locations - external, Locations - Internal, and Outside Broadcast.
Thorne is married to Rachel Mason. They have one son, Elliott, who was named after the human protagonist ofE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. He and Mason underwent multiple attempts at IVF to have their son, the experience later leading them to develop the filmJoy.[63]His wife's sister Cath is the long-term partner of the comedianFrank Skinner.[64]
In 2022, Thorne was diagnosed as beingautistic. He was inspired to seek diagnosis following a question onDesert Island Discs.[65]
