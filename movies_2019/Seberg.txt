On the jet flight infirst class, she witnesses a Black activist insisting on sitting in first class and offering to pay for the seats. The activist demands preferential treatment forMalcolm X's widow, claiming she should be treated like "royalty"; Seberg appears to be attracted to the passenger, who introduces himself asHakim Jamal, a member of theBlack Panther Party(BPP).
Upon landing in the U.S., Seberg notices a group of Black activists protesting at the airport, indicating their displeasure with the treatment Jamal and his traveling companions received on the flight. She joins them and raises her fist in aBlack power salutein solidarity. Unbeknownst to her, undercoverFBIagents, including Jack Solomon, are at the airport. Solomon suggests the FBI shadow her activities while she is in the U.S. and arranges to have herphone conversations tappeddue to her perceived association with theBlack Power movement.
After telling Jamal she knows the incident on the plane was staged to get her attention, Seberg begins a sexual relationship with him, despite both of them being married. The FBI's surveillance programCOINTELPRObegins to target Seberg, recording her and Jamal having sex and playing it to Jamal's wife, Dorothy, over the phone.
Jamal ends things with Seberg after Dorothy confronts him, leaving Seberg devastated. She becomes increasingly suspicious, fearing her daily life is being monitored. Solomon anonymously calls Seberg to warn her to sever her ties with the movement.
Seberg becomes pregnant by an unknown person. Continuing their surveillance and harassment of her for years, COINTELPRO agents create a rumor that the baby was fathered by a member of the BPP and feed it to the media. Seberg attempts suicide, which leads to themiscarriageof her unborn daughter. The combination of her daughter's death and the FBI'ssmear campaignabout the child's paternity send her into a deepdepression.
Seberg announces she would sue the publication that published the rumor. Solomon, wanting to come clean, shows her the FBI file on her at a bar, confirming her suspicions.
After the encounter, the real-life Seberg is explained to have moved back to Paris while still supporting the BPP and died in 1979 due to a probable suicide.
