Bullied as a child, businesswoman Jordan Sanders has become the bully as she runs her own tech company like a dictator and treats her employees very poorly. After she behaves rudely towards a child using a toy magic wand, the child wishes that Jordan was a kid again.
The wish comes true the next morning when Jordan wakes up as her 13-year-old self. With her assistant April Williams temporarily taking over the company, Jordan is forced to return to the school where she was previously bullied. Because Jordan is now a "minor", April poses as her aunt.
At school, Jordan is introduced to her teacher, Mr. Marshall, whom she develops a crush on. Once again the target of bullies, Jordan befriends three other outcasts - Isaac, Raina, and Devon. Meanwhile, April has difficulty keeping everyone's attention at work without Jordan's authority to back her up. At a restaurant, Jordan and April have dinner, bonding over their personal lives. Jordan loudly singsMary J. Blige's "I'm Goin' Down" while intoxicated, embarrassing April. Despite her embarrassment, April sings along with Jordan, ending with Jordan accidentally pulling off a man's weave.
Meanwhile, the company's biggest client threatens to move to a competitor if the firm doesn't pitch him a great idea for a mobile app. Unable to reach Jordan before they pitch, April presents an original idea, "Discover Eyes", that Jordan had previously blocked her from pitching. Jordan is upset with April for this, they argue, and April quits her job.
After Jordan realizes how terrible she's been to April and everyone who cares about her, she helps her friends at school perform at apep rally. At first, they are booed by the crowd, but after a successful performance, they earn a round of applause and the respect of their peers. April finds the girl who turned Jordan into a girl and asks that she turn her back to normal; the attempt seemingly fails. Jordan, having changed inside, vows to be a better friend to April. Jordan wakes up the next morning restored to her adult self and returns to work with a respectful and positive attitude towards her employees. After several rejections, April's pitch scores a huge client. Jordan throws the company a party to celebrate the company's success with April's pitch, and April is given a well-deserved promotion to Creative Executive.

I could've gone to school until I was 75 years old as long as somebody would've paid my rent. I would've been a professional student."[5]
She wanted a career with impact and envisioned a career in writing or journalism, but Hall's first semester of graduate school changed drastically when her father died of astroke.[8]"It was sudden. And I think when sudden events that are painful happen in your life, you know, they redirect your course," Hall reflected. "When you're young, you don't grasp the gravity of life. But when you lose someone that you spend most of your life with, and you're young, you do. And so I think that started me thinking about what I really wanted to do in life. And I know my father would have wanted me to finish school. So I did that."[9]She began a career in the entertainment industry, starting off with a guest appearance onSadat X's 1996 albumWild Cowboyson the track, "The Interview".

I metSanaa Lathanon it, and we didLove and Basketballtogether, which was my second film. And then, at that point, I was visiting L.A. to stay and it led to a third film and a fourth film. And it was really a big deal because I'd never been on a set before."[10]

All of the cast was seen as having a "perfect mix of charisma and likability".[18]Jessica Herndon of theAssociated Pressstated "Hart and Hall are the best part of this film. They play the couple you know all too well: fiery, able to press one another's buttons and always caught in the makeup to breakup game." Negative reviews of the film also praised the pairing of Hall with Kevin Hart. Mick LaSalle ofThe San Francisco Chronicleexpressed that Hart was "well paired for Hall, who matches him for comedy."[19]At the time of the film's release, both Hall and Hart expressed interest in working on other projects together.[20]About Last Nightwas her third ensemble film and Hall reflected that she learned from actors she worked with in ensembles.[21]

Bob had made a television movie about scleroderma years ago because his sister had died from it. That was back when they didn't even know what it was.
