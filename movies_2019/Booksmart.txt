High schoolseniorsAmy Antsler and Molly Davidson, longtime best friends, are accomplishedIvy League–bound students but, despite Molly being class president, not popular with their peers.
Amy has a crush on a girl named Ryan, which Molly urges her to pursue.
On the eve of graduation, Molly confronts classmates insulting her bookishness, telling them she got intoYale University, but they reveal that, despite their partying, they also got into prestigious colleges or job recruitments.
Furious, Molly tells Amy they should have enjoyed their time in high school more, and Amy reluctantly agrees to go to a graduation party held by classmate Nick.
Unaware of the party's address, Molly calls Jared, a wealthy classmate who likes her. He instead takes them to his own party aboard a yacht. Only his drug-crazed friend Gigi is there, who feeds the girls strawberries before jumping off the yacht. Amy suggests they go home, but Molly calls a "Malala", their code for unconditionally supporting what the other wants to do.
The girls call aridesharecar and are shocked to be picked up by their principal, Jordan Brown.
To prepare Amy for possible sex with Ryan, Molly insists they watchpornography, which accidentally plays through the car speakers.
Brown drops them off at what they think is Nick's party, but it is the home of their classmate George, who is hosting amurder mystery party. They again encounter Gigi, who reveals that the strawberries were laced withhallucinogens, whereupon theytripthat they are plastic fashion dolls. They leave George's house, but Gigi reveals Molly secretly likes Nick.
Amy insists they press on so that Molly can pursue her crush on Nick. They see pizza boxes in an online video of Nick's party and acquire the address by threatening the pizza delivery man. With only 2%phone battery, Molly calls their favorite teacher, Miss Fine, who gives them a ride to Nick's party.
Once there, they are surprised to find they are warmly welcomed. Molly and Nick flirt overbeer pongand Amy spends time with Ryan. Amy finds Ryanmaking outwith Nick. Heartbroken, she finds Molly and calls her own "Malala", which Molly refuses because she still thinks she has a chance with Nick. Amy angrily reveals she is not just spending the summer inBotswanabut taking an entiregap yearbecause she resents how Molly always tries to control her life. The two argue in front of the entire party.
Amy runs to the bathroom, finding her classmate Hope. They are initially argumentative until Amy kisses her. They start to have sex, until Amy vomits on Hope. Jared and Molly have a heartfelt conversation about how no-one at school really knows them. Cops arrive at the party and everyone scatters. Unable to find Amy, Molly is driven home by "Triple A", a popular student with a promiscuous reputation. They bond over the stereotyping they have both endured.
Waking up on graduation day, Molly checks her phone and discovers her classmates praising Amy for creating a diversion at the party, allowing everyone to escape the police while getting herself arrested. Molly visits Amy in jail and apologizes for her manipulative actions, and they reconcile. Recognizing that the pizza delivery man is a serial killer from a wanted poster in jail, they trade information to free Amy, and take Jared's car to graduation.
Molly kisses Jared onstage and gives an improvisedvaledictorianspeech, receiving a standing ovation.
A few days later, as Molly helps Amy prepare for her trip toBotswana, Hope visits to give Amy her phone number.
Molly drives Amy to the airport where they share a tearful goodbye, but then Amy decides she still has time to hang out before her flight, so they ecstatically decide to get pancakes.
An early version of the screenplay,Book Smartby Emily Halpern and Sarah Haskins, was circulated in 2009 and appeared on the 2009Black List;[7]in 2014Susanna Fogelrevised the screenplay, rewriting one lead character as alesbianand revising the story so the girls are not seeking boyfriends for the prom, but are going to an after-prom party.[8]
Following the revisions,Annapurna Picturespurchased the screenplay and approachedGloria Sanchez Productionsto produce it; Gloria Sanchez'Jessica Elbaumpitched the screenplay toOlivia Wilde, who read the screenplay and two days later expressed admiration for it.[8]Megan Ellison, Chelsea Bernard, David Distenfeld,Will Ferrell,Adam McKay, and Elbaum would serve as producers on the film.[9]ScreenwriterKatie Silbermanwas hired for more revisions in spring 2018, and to update the story.[8][10]Silberman explored a new concept:
What if the two friends realized that they did high school all wrong? What if they realized that everyone they thought just partied and wasted their high-school years were going to Ivy League schools just like them?[8]
According to Silberman, "Olivia's mantra to all of us was that high school iswar".[11]Wilde also envisioned "a drug trip where the girls turned intoBarbiedolls" and gave Silberman the responsibility of where to incorporate it into the story.[12]
In February 2018,Kaitlyn DeverandBeanie Feldsteinjoined the cast of the film.[13]In May 2018,Billie LourdandSkyler Gisondojoined the cast of the film.[14][15]That same month,Jason Sudeikis,Lisa Kudrow,Jessica Williams,Will Forte,Mike O'Brien,Mason Gooding,Noah Galvin,Diana Silvers,Austin Crute,Eduardo Franco,Molly Gordon, andNico Hiragajoined the cast of the film.[16]
Silvers was initially asked to audition for Ryan, but felt her appearance was not ideal for the character and auditioned for Hope instead.[17]Wilde also urged Feldstein and Dever to live together to develop a rapport.[18]The two actresses were roommates in Los Angeles for ten weeks.[19]Wilde also asked the cast to read the screenplay and signal if they found dialogue that felt "inauthentic ... [and] rewrite it in your own voice".[19]Silberman continued to write after casting, finding it easy to come up with dialogue to fit Feldstein and Dever.[10]Silberman particularly credited the complementary language the characters use to Feldstein, who frequently posted "I have no breath" toInstagram.[12]Wilde joked that her relationship with Sudeikis was his audition.[20][21]
Principal photographybegan in May 2018 around theSan Fernando Valley.[22][23]As a working mother, Wilde found the night filming challenging, but in the morning after filming she would take the time to bring her children to school. The effort was not something she could keep up in the long run, but having achieved her dream of getting to direct she was determined to "give it my all and make it work".[20]
The research scene inside the library took place atWoodbury University.[24]
Wilde and production designer Katie Byron decorated the bedrooms seen in the film, including with trophies and depictions of prominent American womenMichelle ObamaandRuth Bader Ginsburg.[12]
The animated dolls sequence was created over five months by a team of thirty people. Wilde had voiced a character on the seriesBoJack Horsemanand contactedShadowMachine, the animation studio behindBoJack, to create the sequence. Due to script rewrites, parts of the animated scene involving aRoombaand a scene showing glitter vomit were cut from the film.[25]
ThescoreforBooksmartwas composed byDan the Automator. Although he had assisted with the scores ofScott Pilgrim vs. the World(2010) andMoney Monster(2016),Booksmartwas the first full film score that Dan composed for a major US film.[26][27]
Booksmartpremiered at theSouth by Southwestfilm festival on March 10, 2019.[28]It was then released theatrically in the United States on May 24, 2019, byAnnapurna Picturesunder itsUnited Artistslabel. United Artists also utilized anInstagramcampaign to sell tickets to a total of 800 advanced screenings across the country on May 17, 2019.[29]While some film analysts predicted thatBooksmartwould have its theatrical release in the fall, following the trend of previous R-rated, female-centered filmsLady BirdandThe Edge of Seventeen, Annapurna decided on awide releaseoverMemorial Dayweekend in order to build on the word-of-mouth traction they had generated from the festival premiere.[30]Booksmartwas released ondigital downloadon August 20, 2019, and on DVD and Blu-ray on September 3, 2019.[31]
Booksmartgrossed $22.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $2.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $24.9 million.[4][3]
In the United States and Canada,Booksmartwas released alongsideAladdinandBrightburn, and was projected to gross around $12 million from 2,505 theaters in its four-dayopening weekend.[32]The film made $2.5 million on its first day, including $875,000 from Thursday night previews. It ended up underperforming, debuting to just $6.9 million (a four-day total of $8.7 million), finishing in sixth place.[33]Industry publications insisted that although the targeted young female demographic did turn out to the film, it should have begun with alimited releaseand expanded, similar to the R-rated, female-led high school comedyLady Birdin 2017, and thatBooksmartfailed to stand out in the crowded marketplace.[34][35][33][2]In its second weekend the film made $3.3 million, dropping 52% and finishing in eighth.[36]
The film's largest market outside North America was theUnited Kingdom, where it grossed around US$1.8 million (£1.5 million) after seven weeks in theaters.[37]
DirectorJ. J. Abramsasked: "When you have a movie that's as entertaining, well-made, and well-received asBooksmartnot doing the business it should have [the teen comedy underperforming at the box office despite critics' raves], it really makes you realize that the typicalDarwinianfight to survive is completely lopsided now. Everyone's trying to figure out how we protect the smaller films that aren't four-quadrant mega-releases. Can they exist in the cinema?"[38]
On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 96% based on 377 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Fast-paced, funny, and fresh,Booksmartdoes the seemingly impossible by adding a smart new spin to the coming-of-age comedy."[39]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[40]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an overall positive score of 80%.[33]In December 2019, Rotten Tomatoes namedBooksmartthe #1 comedy of the decade on the site, using an adjusted formula that weighed multiple factors, including a film's release year and number of reviews.[41]
Peter Debruge ofVarietypraised the ensemble cast as well as Wilde's direction, calling the film "the best high school buddy comedy sinceSuperbad".[42]John DeFore ofThe Hollywood Reportercalled the film a "hilarious, blazingly paced teen comedy."[43]Writing for theChicago Sun-Times,Richard Roepergave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it a "refreshingly original take on the raunchy coming-of-age comedy" and praising Feldstein and Dever's chemistry.[44]Alissa Wilkinson ofVoxawarded the film a score of four out of five, writing that the "memorably relatable"Booksmartis also a "delightful reminder that growing up is about realizing nobody's a stereotype".[45]
Linda Holmes ofNPRgave an especially favorable review, calling the film "a humane and heartfelt film without a mean bone in its figurative body".[46]Vulture's Emily Yoshida also favorably wrote that it "manages to be inclusive and progressive, without being precious about anything or sacrificing an ounce of humor".[47]A. O. ScottofThe New York Timesregarded the film as "sharp but not mean, warm without feeling too soft or timid", and referring to Feldstein and Dever as "a classic comedy duo".[48]Joe MorgensternofThe Wall Street JournaldeemedBooksmarta "prodigy", stating that no film that was "funnier, smarter, quicker or more joyous has graced the big screen in a long time."[49]

Sarah Haskins(born August 3, 1979) is an American comedian known for her satire about gender stereotypes in the media.
A native ofChicago, Illinois, Haskins attendedFrancis W. Parker Schoolin Chicago'sLincoln Park.[1]A 2001 graduate ofHarvard College, she was also a member of the improv comedy troupeThe Immediate Gratification Players.[2]
Once, when I was about eleven and my sister was eight, we were going on a camping trip. The day of the trip, in the car, on the way, I got scared and started trying to back out of the trip saying I don't want to go. And my Mom, turned around in her seat and yelled "YOU'RE GOING! YOU COME FROM A LINE OF STRONG WOMEN!" And I think that attitude's infected me. There are also strong women in the industry, and a lot of them have been very helpful to me – so, I have a positive attitude right now. I want to do stuff, and I don't want anyone to stop me.[3]
When asked if she is a feminist: "Yes, I’m a feminist. It is an extension of my lifelong war against pantyhose. To me it means that as women we are individuals before we are gendered people and that we’re not defined by our gender except in the ways we chose to appropriate that definition. We’re in a weird generation, right? Our moms were forced to grapple with that definition more immediately, and I think it’s changed as we’ve grown up. The core issue 'how do I fight bias against me because of my gender' is still there but has gotten more complicated and wrapped into all kinds of identity issues about how you present yourself as a woman and I pretty much think it's your choice. And fuck pantyhose."[4]
A self-described liberal and feminist,[4]she has spoken in interviews about the many traditional and new roles that women of the modern world are expected to fulfill: taking on new roles as career women and as financially independent individuals while still adhering to antiquated stereotypes about an ideal woman and her role in a traditional society.[5]
Haskins majored in American history and literature at Harvard University. While at Harvard she began improvising with a group called IGP or "the Immediate Gratification Players." This inspired her interest in comedy. "Freshman year of college I saw a show at Second City calledThe Psychopath Not Taken. I loved it—I was doing improv at the time at school with a great group called IGP—and Psychopath expanded my sense of what comedy could do. It was funny, smart, and important.”[4]
Haskins was an improvisational and sketch comedy performer at I.O. (ImprovOlympic) Chicago as well as with theSecond CityNational Touring Company for six years before moving to California.[6]She lists her influences and heroes as "Chicago,Katharine Graham,Tina Fey, improvisation,Francis Parker".[6]
In October 2007, she relocated to Los Angeles, where she currently resides.[2]She worked as a full-time writer forCurrent TVand a regular contributor to the weekly seriesInfoManiaon Current, a network co-founded by former Vice PresidentAl Gore. Haskins wrote and starred in the InfoMania segment "Target Women" in which she commented on products, advertising, and media aimed at women. Segment topics have included: wedding shows, jewelry, cleaning supplies,Sarah Palinand the "lady vote",Twilight, cars andThe View. The show’s first episode, "Target Women: Yogurt", was an online hit.
Her comedy led to interviews with The Rumpus,[7]Mother Jones,[8]Jezebel,[3]and The Paper Machete.[9]Utne Reader named her one of "50 Visionaries Who Are Changing The World".[10]
In January 2010, Haskins parted ways with Current TV, leaving her central role in the Target Women segment behind.[3]After InfoMania, Haskins andEmily Halpernco-wrote the short filmDILF.[11][12]Haskins also co-starred in the short filmsThe Cat Whisperer[13]andHow To Be Sexy.[14]
Despite positive reviews by critics,[15]Haskins' sitcom projectTrophy Wifeaired for one season on ABC before being canceled.[16][17]Haskins and Emily Halpern co-wrote the 2019 filmBooksmart.

Orville Willis Forte IV[3]was born inAlameda, California, on June 17, 1970.[4]The son of artist and former schoolteacher Patricia C. (néeStivers)[5][6]and financial broker Orville Willis "Reb" Forte III.[3]He grew up inMoragabefore moving toLafayetteat age 13.[7]He went by "Billy" in his early years until he was teased at school for it also being a girl's name. At that point he decided he would from then on be known as "Will".[8]Forte described himself as having been a "really happy little boy" whose parents were "wonderful" and created a "very loving environment".[9]He was interested in comedy from a young age, growing up idolizing comediansPeter Sellers,David Letterman, andSteve Martinas well as the sketch-comedy television seriesSaturday Night Live.[10]He often pulled pranks on his parents,[10]and would record himself performing imaginary radio shows. He did not aim to be a comedian, but initially wanted to become afootballplayer.[9]
Forte was "a laid-back teen with a lot of friends", and a member of the varsity football and swim teams atAcalanes High Schoolin Lafayette where he graduated in 1988. He was voted "Best Personality" by his graduating class and served as freshman class president.[8][11]He had no ambitions for a television or film career, though his mother noticed a "creative streak" in him. After high school, he attended theUniversity of California, Los Angeles, where he was a member of theLambda Chi Alphafraternity and completed a degree in history.[12]Forte wanted to become a financial broker like his father atSmith Barney Shearson, but felt "miserable" there.[8]He co-wrote a feature-length script while there,[9]and later said that he discovered he loved writing "more than anything [he] had ever done in [his] life".[8]He had been encouraged to attempt comedy during his years at university, and he decided to change his career path to do so.[13]
Forte began taking classes atThe GroundlingsinLos Angeles, animprovisationalandsketch comedytroupe and school, while tutoring children to make ends meet. His first successful foray into comedy was101 Things to Definitely Not Do If You Want to Get a Chick, acomic bookhe produced about incompetent men.[10]The comics landed him his first professional job writing forThe Jenny McCarthy Show, a short-livedvariety showstarringJenny McCarthy. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to submit a packet to theLate Show with David Lettermanand was told Letterman responded favorably to animation.[10]After only nine months atLetterman, he was "let go" from the job. He recalled his stint on the program as unpleasant, noting that he did not have enough experience in writing.[14]"What an honor to work at that show but I don't think I was fully mentally prepared. [...] I always wonder what it would be like if I'd had a couple more years of experience before going there."[15]
Forte left New York and returned to Los Angeles, where he began performing with the Groundlings' Main Company, withCheryl Hines,Jim Rash, andMaya Rudolph.[9]He triedstand-up comedythree times, mostly at open mic nights, but quit after being voted into the Main Company.[9]He joined the writing teams of two failed sitcoms, includingThe Army ShowandAction. Forte got jobs writing for3rd Rock from the SunandThat '70s Show. He loved writing and had mostly given up on acting, aside from acting with the Groundlings.[9]While performing with the troupe in 2001, he was spotted byLorne Michaels, the creator ofSaturday Night Live(SNL). Forte felt his confidence was higher than usual, asThat '70s Showhad been picked up for two more years.[9]He was invited to audition forSNL, which he regarded as unexpected.[14]
At his audition forSNL, he performed multiple original characters, includingTim Calhoun, a speed reader, a prison guard, in addition to impressions of singerMichael McDonaldand actorMartin Sheen.[9]His final character was an older piece from his days with the Groundlings, in which he portrays a gold-painted street performer who performsfellatioto pay for his face paint, which devolves into a song needlessly uttering the words "cock" and "face paint" dozens of times.[14]He felt his time to shine as a performer was already over, as he was in his thirties when he auditioned.[8]To his surprise, he was offered a chance to be on the show, but declined, opting instead for the financial stability of his work atThat '70s Show.[16]He felt working forSNLcould not live up to the idealized version he had dreamed of, but he later realized he would be making a mistake.[15][17]
AfterWill FerrellleftSaturday Night Livethe following spring, Forte joined the cast, premiering at the beginning of the show'stwenty-eighth seasonin the autumn. He was promoted to repertory player after his first year.[13]His early years on the program were characterized bystage frightand an inability to properly interpret sketches that he did not write himself.[17]He had to "re-learn" how to perform after years as a writer, and later felt his natural tendency to "overthink" things improved his performance.[15]He was particularly uncomfortable portraying PresidentGeorge W. Bush, as he felt he was not the best impressionist and it paled in comparison to Ferrell's impersonation of Bush.[18]His only role was often Bush, leaving him no chance for more "absurd" pieces he favored. He was nearly fired from the program following his third season (2004–05), but after two three-week extensions to decide his fate, he was brought back.[17]Forte estimated it took five seasons for him to feel fully comfortable performing on the show.[19]He made his film debut inAround the World in 80 Days.[20]
"I've always liked weirder stuff. My main thing onSNLwas that I was never gonna change my sensibility to get on TV—I was just gonna write what I liked writing and hopefully have a hit on that show somewhere."
His humor atSNLhas been described as bizarre,[14]and he became known for many "10-to-1" sketches—pieces that were considered odd, placed at the very end of the show. He was also well known for his charactersTim Calhoun,Greg Stink, andthe Falconer. Forte's favorite sketch on the show was one in which he played a motivational coach alongside football starPeyton Manning.[13]He also co-starred withAndy Sambergin the firstSNLDigital Short, "Lettuce". He often spent long hours crafting his sketches for the program, missing deadlines, but his pieces were usually received warmly attable reads.[16][17]During his time at the show, he co-starred in and wrote the 2007 filmThe Brothers Solomon. The film was originally a pilot forCarsey-Werner, and its creation was an extension of his agreement to terminate his contract to appear onSNL.[21]
Forte's best-known character onSNLwasMacGruber, aspecial operationsagent who is tasked in each episode with deactivating a ticking bomb but becomes distracted by personal issues. The sketches were based on the television seriesMacGyver. It was created by writerJorma Taccone, who relentlessly pitched the idea to Forte.[18]He was initially reluctant to commit to the sketch, deeming it too dumb, but accepted after persuasion from Taccone.[22]The first sketch aired in January 2007, and led to multiple more segments in the following years. In 2009, the sketches were spun off into a series of commercials sponsored byPepsipremiering duringSuper Bowl XLIIIwhich featured the actor behind MacGyver,Richard Dean Anderson, as MacGruber's father. The advertisements led the character and sketches to receive a wider level of popularity.[22]After the success of the advertisements, creatorLorne Michaelsapproached Forte, Taccone, and writer John Solomon with the idea to produce aMacGruberfilm.[23]
Regarding his experiences onSNL, Forte remarked, "Looking back, the experience is something I'll never forget. I still miss it, and I'll always miss it. That's my family."[19]His celebrity impressions includedGeorge W. Bush,Tom DeLay,John Edwards,Timothy Geithner,Newt Gingrich,Chad Lowe,Zell Miller,David Petraeus,Harry Reid,Brian Williams, andHu Jintao.[24]
In the summer of 2009,MacGruberwas shot on a tight schedule for four weeks inAlbuquerque, New Mexico.[22][25]It was written while simultaneously producing the weekly episode ofSNL, and the show'sproduction processleft the trio deprived of sleep.[26]Forte was positive regarding the film, saying,
What you see with this movie is exactly what we wanted to do. It's the three of us having a bunch of fun writing it, then having fun making it with a bunch of our friends—old friends and new friends. I think that fun comes across when you watch it. It's rare that you get that kind of creative freedom.[18]
The film was released in May 2010 and received mixed reviews.[27]It fared worse at the box office, where it failed to recoup its budget and was pulled from theaters after its third week.[28]Forte found the failure tolerable, commenting, "When you make something that you're really proud of and it doesn't do well, you can live with it."[17]The film has since seen more of a positive reception and has been dubbed acult classic.[29][30]
Forte leftSaturday Night Liveshortly before the beginning of the show'sthirty-sixth seasonin 2010. He felt it was the "right time to go", considering his eight-year tenure there, his expansion into film withMacGruber, and his age. In addition, his sister had just had children and he wanted to move to the West Coast to be closer to them.[13]He soon regretted the decision, calling the following year an "emotionally trying period", as he felt "devastated" that he would no longer be on the program.[10]He assumed his shot at a film career was ruined,[17]and he imagined that if acting did not work out, he would return to mostly writing.[10]Afterwards he entered what he has called a "lost period"[14]and had small supporting roles, such asRock of Ages,That's My Boy,andThe Watch, all of which were not successful.[14]The only commercial successful film which he worked on wasGrown Ups 2, where he made acameoas a male cheerleader.[14]He also took a role asPaul L'astnamé, the cross-dressing boyfriend ofJenna Maroneyon the critically acclaimed sitcom30 Rock.[14]
Forte took his first dramatic role for the 2013 filmRun & Jump. DirectorSteph Greenoffered him the part, and Forte imagined it a "fun thing to try", though he noted that she had more confidence in him than he had himself.[13]Later, he sent an audition tape toAlexander Paynefor a role in his next film,Nebraska.[13]He equated his casting in the film to his fear of joiningSNLa decade prior, noting that he was "terrified" to begin working on it.[14]He felt scared initially, but followedBruce Dern's acting advice to "look for the truth" in each scene—in other words, "In every scene, you're just trying to play it as honestly and as real as you can."[15]
Forte began working onThe Last Man on Earth, a sitcom, with longtime collaboratorsPhil Lord and Christopher Millerin 2013. Though it was the duo's idea, Forte attached himself to the concept, crafting atreatmentover a weekend. The series waspitchedaroundHollywoodto positive responses and was picked up in 2014 byFox.[31]Forte served as the series' creator, a writer, the lead role, and showrunner for the first season. He felt odd being in charge of its writing team (composed of longtime friends), and awkward at delegating tasks, so much so that he would end up doing the work himself.[15]Being a showrunner "truly was an amount of work I never knew existed," he said, which involved him working a "minimum of 12 hours" daily.[32]The series premiered in 2015 to positive responses,[33]and was renewed for the next three seasons.[34]
In 2016, Forte played Hulka, a low-level weed dealer, in the comedyKeanu, starringJordan PeeleandKeegan-Michael Key.[35]In 2018, he playedNational Lampoonmagazine co-founderDouglas Kenneyin theNetflixbiographical filmA Futile and Stupid Gesture.[36]The film was directed byDavid Wainand featuresDomhnall Gleesonas co-founderHenry Beard.[37]Forte voicedShaggy Rogersin theScooby-DoofilmScoob!.[38]In 2021, Forte starred inSweet Tooth, reprised his role as MacGruber in aTV seriesonPeacock, and began voicing Wolf Tobin in the animated sitcomThe Great North. In 2022, it was announced that Forte had a leading role for Disney and Pixar's first animated television seriesWin or Lose. It is set to premiere on Disney+ in 2025.[39]He voiced an older version of the titular character inScott Pilgrim Takes Off. In 2024, Forte was announced in the main role of Martin inSunny Nights.[40]
Forte dated hisLast Man on Earthco-starJanuary Jonesin 2015.[41]He and Olivia Modling were engaged in 2019; they met in 2018.[41]They have two daughters Zoe Douglas Forte, born in February 2021, and Cecilia, born approximately 18 months later.[42]He and Modling married on July 31, 2021.[43]They live in a modestly sized Craftsman home inSanta Monica, California. Forte bought the home in 2002, just two weeks before joining the cast ofSaturday Night Livewhich required him to move toNew York City. He admitted later that "it was not the greatest timing."[5]
Forte's mother, Patricia has visited every film set on which he has worked and made an appearance on aMother's Dayepisode ofSNL, in which he sang a song to her onWeekend Update. Will  officiated his sister Michelle's wedding; he filmed the birth of his niece and nephew.[44]
Will Forte has discussed and joked about hisOCDtendencies.[45][5]He recounted listening to only one song in his office atSNLfor an entire year because he wanted to challenge himself.[46]During an interview withLarry King, he discussed his OCD as a challenge he had to overcome but not one he wished he did not have, as it is a part of his personality.[47][48]In a February 2015 article onGrantlandthe writer of the article said that Forte mentioned OCD often but it was not clear if he had ever been formally diagnosed, though Forte related how he and a former girlfriend had gone through an OCD questionnaire and it concluded that Forte "should immediately talk to someone about this".[45]
Forte is an avid gamer. While filmingA Good Old-Fashioned Orgy, he achieved one of the world's highest scores on the arcade version ofDonkey Kong.[49]
