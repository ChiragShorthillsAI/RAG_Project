In 2016,Skydance Mediapurchased the rights to the screenplay (which had been through several rewrites) fromWalt Disney Picturesand, in October 2017, Ang Lee signed on to direct for Skydance withParamount Pictureshandling distribution. Filming took place from February through May 2018 using ahigh frame rateof 120 frames per second.

The film received generally negative reviews from critics for its plot and screenwriting, although the performances and action sequences were praised. Thede-agingof Smith and the high frame rate drew mixed responses.[3][4]It was also abox-office bomb, grossing only $174 million against its $138 million budget, with Paramount losing an estimated $111 million.

Henry Brogan, a 51-year-old formerForce Recon MarineScout Sniperworking as an operative of theDefense Clandestine Serviceof theDefense Intelligence Agency, is sent to assassinate a bioterrorist aboard a train inBelgium. Henry's spotter warns him of a young girl approaching the target, causing him to delay his shot until the last second, shooting the man in the neck despite aiming for his head. Disillusioned with killing, Henry retires.
InButtermilk Sound, Georgia, Henry meets boat rental manager Danny and reconnects with his old friend Jack, who tells Henry that his informant Yuri claims that the target on the train was innocent. Demanding proof, Henry has Jack arrange a meeting with him. In retaliation, agency director Lassiter plans to kill Henry; Clay Verris, director of a rogueprivate military companycodenamed "GEMINI", is denied permission to eliminate him.
Deducing that Danny is a fellow agent sent to monitor him, Henry befriends her. After his home is broken into by government agents, he calls his spotter, who is killed along with Jack and his mistress. Henry warns Danny, and they kill the assassins sent after them, realizing the agency wants them both dead. They escape toColombiawith Baron, Henry's former colleague, hiding at his home and planning to meet with Yuri.
Clay dispatches his top assassin to kill Henry. Fighting him off, Henry realizes the assassin bears an uncanny resemblance to himself as a young man. Arriving at a safe house, the assassin is revealed to be Clay's adopted "son" Junior. Curious about his similarities to Henry, Junior is ordered to finish the job. Danny suggests the assassin might be Henry's child, despite his denials.
Desperate for answers, Henry has Baron obtain aGulfstreamand transport them toHungary. TestingDNArecovered from Junior, Danny discovers that his and Henry's DNA are identical – Junior is Henry'sclone. Henry meets Yuri and learns of GEMINI's cloning project; the man he killed on the train was a scientist who tried to leave the project, having designed a method to produce clones devoid of pain or emotion. Henry calls Lassiter, who agrees to send Junior to bring Danny safely back to the United States.
Collecting Danny, Junior sets up a trap for Henry, who is warned via acovert listening devicehidden in Danny's mouth. Ambushing the younger assassin, Henry explains to Junior that he is a clone, revealing their similar traits that no one else could know. Escaping to GEMINI, a heartbroken Junior confronts Clay, who insists he must defeat Henry in order to surpass him. Finding Henry, Junior allies with him to bring down Clay, and Henry urges Junior to quit in order to become someone better.
Baron is killed in an ambush ordered by Clay, with Junior knocking Clay unconscious after a brief hand-to-hand fight. After defeating a wave of GEMINI operatives, Henry, Danny, and Junior face another seemingly unstoppable operative with special body armor. They manage to mortally wound him, and he is discovered to be another youthful clone of Henry, lacking all emotion and ability to feel pain.
Defeated, Clay tries to justify his actions to Junior: clones with Henry's skills would spare the lives of soldiers while making operations incredibly successful. Disgusted, Junior prepares to shoot Clay, but Henry persuades him otherwise and does it himself.
Assured that no more clones were produced and they are finally free, Henry later meets with Junior, who has enrolled in college under the assumed identity of "Jackson Brogan" after Henry's mother's surname. Together, Henry and Danny plan Jackson's future.

In 1997,Darren Lemkesold his pitch forGemini Manafter impressingDon Murphywith an unproducedspec script.Warner Bros. Picturespursued the project, butWalt Disney Picturesultimately won out andTony Scottwould become attached to direct.[9][10]Complications soon arose when the studio were planning how to make the film.Harrison FordandChris O'Donnellwere considered for the lead roles.[11]The producers toyed with the idea of an actor play both roles through the use ofvisual effects, but Scott moved on from the film before any progress could be made.Mel Gibsonbriefly boarded the project and shot test footage before departing.[12]At the time, Disney's now-defunct animation/visual effects departmentThe Secret Labdeveloped a test short, known asHuman Face Project, to create visual effects for the film, which would involve creating a younger CG clone of the main actor.[13]Aliscreenwriters Stephen J. Rivele &Christopher Wilkinsonwere hired to polish Lemke's script in July 2000.[14]The following month,Nicolas CageandSean Connerywere in the running for the dual role.[15]In November 2000, the film was retitled toGeminiand was reportedly slotted for a summer 2002 release with Murphy,Jerry BruckheimerandJane Hamsherproducing.[16]In April 2001,Jonathan Hensleighwas selected to reconfigure the script while maintaining Lemke's concept.[17][18]By February 2009,Curtis Hansonentered talks to direct the film whileDavid Benioffhad penned the latest draft of the script.[19]Joe Carnahanhad previously pitched for the film, and developed test footage withClint Eastwoodas the assassin.[10][20]The film never progressed at Disney, though, as the technology was not developed enough at that time for the film to be produced.[10]Carnahan also envisionedJon Voightin the role as well.[21]Later script revisions were done byBilly Ray,Andrew Niccol, andBrian Helgeland.
In 2016,Skydance Mediaacquired the film from Disney, withJerry Bruckheimerproducing, along with Skydance'sDavid Ellison, Dana Goldberg andDon Granger. Murphy, Mike Stenson,Chad Omanand Brian Bell would serve as executive producers.[10]Ang Leewas hired to direct the film for Paramount Pictures and Skydance in April 2017[22]andFosun Picturescame on board to finance soon after with Guo Guangchang also on board as executive producer.[23]

Gemini Manwas released in the United States on October 11, 2019, byParamount Pictures. It was originally scheduled to be released on October 4, but Paramount pushed the film back for release a week later.[24]It premiered at theZurich Film Festivalon October 1, 2019.[33]It was released in 120 fpsHFR(High frame rate) on select screens.[34]
Gemini Manwas released on4K Ultra HD Blu-ray,Blu-rayandDVDon January 14, 2020.[35]The film used 60 fps presentation in Dolby Vision.
Gemini Mangrossed $48.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $124.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $173.5 million.[2]It was estimated the film needed to gross around $275 million worldwide in order tobreak even;Deadline Hollywoodcalculated its net loss to be $111.1million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[36][37]
In the United States and Canada,Gemini Manwas released alongsideThe Addams FamilyandJexi, and was originally projected to gross $24–29 million from 3,642 theaters in its opening weekend.[38]The film made $7.5 million on its first day, including $1.6 million from Thursday night previews, lowering weekend estimates to $20 million. It went on to debut to $20.6 million, finishing third at the box office behindThe Addams FamilyandJoker. The low opening was blamed on poor critical response, the familiar premise and the over-performance ofJoker.[39]In its second weekend,Gemini Manfell 59.6% to $8.3 million, finishing fifth.[40]
The film opened in five countries the week prior to its U.S. release and made $7 million, finishing first in each market: France ($3 million), Germany ($3 million), Switzerland ($434,000), Austria ($262,000) and Israel ($259,000, Lee's best opener in the country).[41]In China,Gemini Mandebuted to $21 million, less than expected, getting upset by fellow new releaseMaleficent: Mistress of Evil. After two weeks the film had a worldwide total of $118 million, including an "underwhelming" $82 million overseas.[37]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 27% and an average rating of 4.7/10, based on 329 reviews. The website's critics consensus reads: "Gemini Man's impressive visuals are supported by some strong performances, but this sci-fi thriller is fatally undermined by a frustratingly subpar story."[42]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[43]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregaveGemini Manan average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it 3.5 out of 5 stars.[39]
Variety's Peter DeBruge called the film "a high-concept misfire" and wrote: "In practice, it's been a nearly impossible project to get made, passing through the hands of countless actors and falling through multiple times because the technology wasn't there yet. At least, that's been the excuse, although judging by the finished product, it was the script that never lived up to the promise of its premise."[44]Ella Kemp ofIndieWiregaveGemini Mana "C+", writing that "For Lee, it seems to make sense – the film welds concerns that have colored a number of his projects: the debate of Nature v Nurture; the alienation of a fraying man; the challenge of what digital filmmaking can do. On paper,Gemini Mantends to all three concerns, but in practice the film is impenetrable beyond its technological clout."[45]
Giving the film one star, Kevin Maher ofThe Timeswas unimpressed with the script and the 120 fps shooting, writing "It keeps every detail in the frame (background and foreground) in vivid, garish focus at all times. Besides being aesthetically repellent (it's like 1980s children's telly or the worst wedding video yet)" and called the de-aging "alarmingly unconvincing".[46]
Gemini Manhas been criticized for its unrealistic level of genetic determinism, and its failure to explicitly distinguish between cloning and cloning combined with genetic engineering.[47]The film relies on the conceit that human cloning is inherently menacing, ignoring the fact that a clone would simply be a younger monozygotic ("identical")twin—with the many possible differences that exist between conventionally born identical twins.[48]The film influencedThalapathy Vijay's science-fiction action filmThe Greatest of All Timein its development and production with a slightly similar plot and also its de-aging technology was used.[49]
Smith received a nomination for Best Motion Capture/Special Effects Performance at theAustin Film Critics Association Awards 2019.[50][51]Gemini Manwas nominated forOutstanding Visual Effects in a Photoreal FeatureandOutstanding Animated Character in a Photoreal Featureat the18th Visual Effects Society Awards.[52]At the46th Saturn Awards, the film was nominated forBest Science Fiction Film.[53][54]

He rose to prominence directing films such asPushing Hands(1991),The Wedding Banquet(1993), andEat Drink Man Woman(1994), which explored the relationships and conflicts between tradition and modernity, Eastern and Western; the three films are informally known as theFather Knows Besttrilogy.[7]The films were critically successful both in Taiwan and internationally.
His breakthrough in Hollywood was the costume dramaSense and Sensibility(1995), which was also his first entirely English-language film. Lee went on to receive theAcademy Award for Best Directortwice for
the romantic dramaBrokeback Mountain(2005) and the survival dramaLife of Pi(2012). He directed films in a broad range of genres, including the dramaThe Ice Storm(1997), the martial arts dramaCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon(2000), the superhero movieHulk(2003), and the erotic espionage dramaLust, Caution(2007).
"the formation of an individual decides their world perception, especially the things that happen before one is 20, so since he did not go to the US until he was 23, "whatever I do, whatever I absorb outside [Taiwan], my nature remains very Taiwanese... The basic me was growing up here, mixed with a lot of other things. Taiwan is like this. Wherever I shoot my film, it is a Taiwanese film"
Lee was born in awaishengrenfamily in amilitary dependents' villageof theRepublic of China Armed Forces, located inChaochou,Pingtung,[9]a southern agriculturalcountyin Taiwan. Both of Lee's parents moved following the end of theChinese civil warin 1949 fromDe'an,Jiangxiprovince inMainland ChinatoTaiwan. He grew up in a household that put a heavy emphasis on education. In 1956, when Lee was 2 years old, his family moved toHualienbecause his father took a position as the Principal ofTaiwan Provincial Hualien Normal School(TPHNS). Lee attended two elementary schools inHualien: Mingli Elementary School and Affiliated Primary School of Taiwan Provincial Hualien Normal School (nowNational Dong Hwa University Experimental Primary School). Lee has mentioned that the eight years he lived in Hualien were the happiest time of his life before he went north to study at National Arts School.[10][11]
Lee studied in the Provincial Tainan First Senior High School (nowNational Tainan First Senior High School) where his father was the principal. He was expected to pass the annual Joint College/University Entrance Examination, the only route to a university education in Republic of China. But after failing the exam twice, to the disappointment of his father, he entered a three-year college, the National Arts School (now reorganized and expanded asNational Taiwan University of Arts), and graduated in 1975. His father had wanted him to become a professor, but he had become interested in drama and the arts in college. This early frustration set his career on the path of performance art. SeeingIngmar Bergman's filmThe Virgin Spring(1960) was a formative experience for him.[12]
After finishing hismandatory military servicein theRepublic of China Navy(ROCN), Lee went to the US in 1979 to study at theUniversity of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he completed his bachelor's degree in theater in 1980. Originally, Lee was interested in acting, but his challenges with speaking English made it difficult, and he quickly turned to directing.[13]At UIUC, Lee met his future wife,Jane Lin(Chinese:林惠嘉;pinyin:Lín Huìjiā), also a student from Taiwan, who was pursuing her PhD degree. Thereupon, he enrolled at theTisch School of the ArtsofNew York University, where he received hisMFAin film production. He was a classmate ofSpike Leeand worked on the crew of his thesis film,Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads.
During graduate school, Lee finished a 16mm short film,Shades of the Lake(1982), which won the Best Drama Award in Short Film in Taiwan. His own thesis work, a 43-minute drama,Fine Line(1984), won NYU'sWasserman Awardfor Outstanding Direction and was also chosen for broadcast by thePublic Broadcasting Service.[14]
Life after graduation
In 1985, Lee's NYU thesis drew attention from theWilliam Morris Agency, the talent and literary agency that later represented Lee. At first, though, WMA found Lee few opportunities, and Lee remained unemployed for six years. During this time, he was a full-time house-husband, while his wife Jane Lin, amolecular biologist, was the sole breadwinner for the family of four. This arrangement put enormous pressure on the couple, but with Lin's support and understanding, Lee did not abandon his career in film but continued to generate new ideas from movies and performances. He also wrote several screenplays during this time.[15]
In 1990, Lee submitted two screenplays,Pushing HandsandThe Wedding Banquet, to a competition sponsored byGovernment Information Officeof R.O.C., and they came in first and second, respectively. The winning screenplays brought Lee to the attention ofHsu Li-kong(Chinese:徐立功;pinyin:Xú Lìgōng), a recently promoted senior manager in a major studio who had a strong interest in Lee's unique style and freshness. Hsu, a first-time producer, invited Lee to directPushing Hands, a full-length feature that debuted in 1991.[citation needed]
The 'Father Knows Best' trilogy
Pushing Hands(1991) was a success in Taiwan both among critics and at the box office. It received eight nominations in theGolden Horse Film Festival, Taiwan's premier film festival. Inspired by the success, Hsu Li-kong collaborated with Lee in their second film,The Wedding Banquet(1993), which won theGolden Bearat the43rd Berlin International Film Festival[16]and was nominated as theBest Foreign Language Film[17]in both theGolden Globeand the Academy Awards. In all, this film collected eleven Taiwanese and international awards and made Lee a rising star. These first two movies were based on stories of Chinese Americans, and both were filmed in the US.
In 1994, Hsu invited Lee to return to Taiwan to makeEat Drink Man Woman, a film that depicts traditional values, modern relationships, and family conflicts inTaipei. The film was a box office hit and was critically acclaimed. For a second consecutive year, Lee's film received the Best Foreign Language Film nomination in both the Golden Globe and Academy Awards, as well as in theBritish Academy Awards(BAFTA)s.Eat Drink Man Womanwon five awards in Taiwan and internationally, including the Best Director fromIndependent Spirit.
The three films show the Confucian family at risk and star the Taiwanese actorSihung Lungto form what has been called Lee's "Father Knows Best" trilogy.[7]
In 1995, Lee directedColumbiaTriStar's British classicSense and Sensibilitybased on theJane Austennovel of the same name. This made Lee a second-time winner of the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and wonBest Adapted Screenplayfor screenwriterEmma Thompson, who also starred in the movie alongsideAlan Rickman,Hugh GrantandKate Winslet.Sense and Sensibilityalso won theGolden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Thompson has described the experience of working with Lee in his first English language film, noting how taken aback Lee was when the actors asked questions or provided suggestions, something Thompson notes as uncommon in Chinese culture. Once this disjuncture was bridged, Thompson remembered having "the most wonderful time because his notes were so brutal and funny."[18]Janet MaslinofThe New York Timespraised Lee's adaptation writing, "Mr. Lee is after something more broadly accessible, a sparkling, colorful and utterly contemporary comedy of manners. He achieves this so pleasantly thatSense and Sensibilitymatches the Austen-basedCluelessfor sheer fun".[19]
After this, Lee continued directing in Hollywood. He madeThe Ice Storm(1997), a drama set in 1970s suburban America, starringKevin Kline,Sigourney Weaver,Joan Allen, andTobey Maguire. The film competed at the1997 Cannes Film Festivalfor thePalme d'Or. It received theCannes Film Festival Award for Best Screenplay. Angie Errigo ofEmpirepraised the film writing, "Lee seems incapable of making a less than outstanding movie" adding, "The real beauty of this film is the way in which Lee shifts his story from sex farce to youth drama to tragic despair with the help of a perfect ensemble cast".[20]
Lee made another film, therevisionist WesterndramaRide with the Devil(1999), set during theAmerican Civil War. The film which starredTobey Maguire,Skeet Ulrich, andJeffrey Wrightreceived mixed reviews and was a box office bomb.Entertainment Weeklydescribed it as "oddly unengaging" and the "waxy yellow buildup of earnest tastefulness seals off every character from our access. These Americans aren't action figures; they're collectible figurines."[21]For a time this interrupted Lee's unbroken popularity – from both general audiences and arthouse aficionados – since his first full-length movie. However, in the late 1990s and 2000s,The Ice Stormhad high VHS and DVD sales and rentals and repeated screenings on cable television, which has increased the film's popularity among audiences.
In 1999, Hsu Li-kong, Lee's old partner and supporter, invited him to make a movie based on the traditional "wuxia" genre concerning the adventures ofmartial artistsin ancient China. Excited about the opportunity to fulfill his childhood dream, Lee assembled a team from the United States, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Mainland China forCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon(2000). The film starredChow Yun-fat,Michelle Yeoh, andZhang Ziyiand had surprising success worldwide. With Chinese dialogue and English subtitles, the film became the highest grossing foreign film in many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Critics praised the film. Michael Rechtshaffen ofThe Hollywood Reporterpraised Lee writing, "for his first Chinese-language assignment since 1994’sEat Drink Man Woman, Lee tries a little martial arts on for size – with jaw-droppingly exhilarating results". He added "A sweeping romantic epic with a strong feminist backbone, the thoroughly entertaining [film] also happens to boast a generous offering of seriously kick-ass action sequences that make The Matrix seem downright quaint by comparison."[22]The film was nominated in 10Academy AwardsincludingBest Picture, Best Foreign Language Film, and Best Director. It ended up winningBest Foreign Language Filmand three technical awards.
In 2003, Lee returned to Hollywood to direct thesuperheroblockbusterHulk, his second big-budget movie after the disappointment ofRide with the Devil's restricted release. The film was produced byUniversal Picturesin collaboration withMarvel Entertainment. It starredEric BanaasBruce Banner / The Hulkwith supporting performances fromJennifer Connelly,Sam ElliotandNick Nolte. The film received mixed reviews while being a financial success, grossing over $245 million at the box office. After the setback, Lee considered retiring early, but his father encouraged him to continue making movies.Roger Ebertgave the film a positive review, writing, "Lee is trying to actually deal with the issues in the story of the Hulk, instead of simply cutting to brainlessvisual effects."
Lee took on a small-budget, low-profile independent film based onAnnie Proulx'sPulitzer Prize-finalist short story,Brokeback Mountain. In a 2005 article[23]byRobert K. Elder, Lee was quoted as saying, "What do I know about gay ranch hands in Wyoming?" In spite of the director's distance from the subject at hand,Brokeback Mountainshowcased Lee's skills in probing the depths of the human heart. The 2005 movie about the forbidden love between twoWyomingsheepherders immediately caught public attention and became a cultural phenomenon, initiating intense debates andbecoming a box office hit.
The film was critically acclaimed at major international film festivals and won Lee numerous Best Director and Best Picture awards worldwide.Brokeback Mountainwas the most acclaimed film of 2005, winning 71 awards and an additional 52 nominations. It won theGolden Lion(best film) award at theVenice International Film Festivaland was named 2005's best film by the Los Angeles, New York, Boston, and London film critics. It also won best picture at the 2005Broadcast Film Critics Association,Directors Guild of America,Writers Guild of America(Adapted Screenplay),Producers Guild of Americaand theIndependent Spirit Awardsas well as theGolden Globe Awardfor Best Motion Picture – Drama, with Lee winning theGolden Globe Awardfor Best Director.Brokeback Mountainalso won Best Film and Best Director at the 2006 BAFTAs. It was nominated for a leading eight Oscars and was the front runner for Best Picture heading into March 5 ceremony, but lost out toCrash, a story about race relations in Los Angeles, in a controversial upset. He became the first non-white person to win the Best Director at the Academy Awards (which he won again forLife of Pi). In 2006, following his Best Director Oscar, Lee was bestowed the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon, the second highest civilian award, by the R.O.C. government.[24]
His next film wasLust, Caution, which was adapted froma novellaby the Chinese authorEileen Chang. The story was written in 1950, and was loosely based on an actual event that took place in 1939–1940 in Japanese-occupied Shanghai, China, during World War II.Lust, Cautionwas distributed byFocus Featuresand premiered at international film festivals in the summer and early fall of 2007. In the U.S., the movie received aNC-17rating (no children 17 and under admitted) from theMPAAmainly due to several strongly explicit sex scenes. This was a challenge to the film's distribution because many theater chains in the United States refuse to show NC-17 films. The director and film studio decided not to appeal the decision. Lee removed 9 minutes from the film to make the content suitable for minor audiences in order to be permitted to showLust, Cautionin mainland China.[25]
Lust, Cautioncaptured the Golden Lion from the 2007 BiennaleVenice Film Festival, making Lee the winner of the highest prize for the second time in three years (Lee is one of only four filmmakers to have won the Golden Lion twice). WhenLust, Cautionwas played in Lee's native Taiwan in its original full-length edition, it was very well received.[citation needed]Staying in Taiwan to promote the film and to participate in a traditional holiday, Lee got emotional[citation needed]when he found that his work was widely applauded by fellow Taiwanese. Lee admitted that he had low expectations for this film from the U.S. audience since "its pace, its film language;– it's all very Chinese."[26]The film was submitted by Taiwan for consideration in theBest Foreign Language Filmcategory at theAcademy Awards, but the Academy ruled that an insufficient number of Taiwanese nationals had participated in the production, thus disqualifying it from further consideration; it was not nominated for any other category.
Lee was chosen to be president of the jury for the 2009Venice Film Festival.[27]Lee's next film after 2009'sTaking WoodstockwasLife of Pi, which was adapted from thenovel of the same namewritten byYann Martel. The story was a retrospective first-person narrative from Pi, a then 16-year-old boy from India, who is the only human to survive the sinking of a freighter on the way fromIndiato Canada. He finds himself on a lifeboat with an orangutan, ahyena, a wounded zebra and a Bengal tiger.[28]During this unlikely journey, young Pi questions his belief in God and the meaning of life. The novel was once considered impossible to make into a movie, but Lee persuaded20th Century Foxto invest $120 million and heavily relied on 3D special effects in post-production. Unlike most other sci-fi precedents, Lee explores the artistic horizon of applying 3D effects and pushes the boundary of how this technology can serve the movie's artistic vision. The movie made its commercial premiere during Thanksgiving weekend of 2012 in the US and worldwide, and became a critical and box office success. In January 2013,Life of Piearned 11 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Visual Effects.[29]He went on to win theAcademy Award for Best Director.
In 2013, he was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the2013 Cannes Film Festival.[30]In March 2013, it was announced that Lee would direct a television pilot for the drama seriesTyrant, created byGideon Raffand developed byHoward GordonandCraig Wright. Production was scheduled for the summer of 2013 for theFXseries.[31]However, Lee decided to quit the project to take a break from his hectic schedule.[32]
Lee next directed the war dramaBilly Lynn's Long Halftime Walkbased on thenovel of the same name. It was his first film since winning the Oscar for Best Director forLife of Pi. The film starredJoe Alwyn,Kristen Stewart,Vin Diesel,Steve Martin, andChris Tucker. The film is a satire on United States involvement inIraq, with the story of a soldier whosePTSDis triggered at a Texan football game. It was distributed bySony Pictures Releasingand was released in November 2016. It premiered at theNew York Film Festivaland received a mixed response from audiences and critics alike and was abox office failure. Many critics criticized itshigh frame rate.Peter BradshawofThe Guardiandescribed the film as having "neither topical immediacy nor any real historical perspective and, burdened with pedantic and predictable flashbacks, it finally leads nowhere interesting at all."[33]
In April 2017, Lee began discussions withSkydance Mediato helm an action thriller film,Gemini Man, that follows a seniorDIAofficial being hunted by a young clone of himself right as he is about to retire from the agency.[34]Will Smithwas cast in the lead role.[35]In January 2018,Clive OwenandMary Elizabeth Winsteadhad been cast as the antagonist and female lead respectively. The film was released on October 11, 2019 to negative reviews and flopped at the box office. Alissa Wilkinson ofVoxwrote, "IfGemini Manis the future of big-budget filmmaking, I hope someone in Hollywood is getting worried."[36]Peter Debruge ofVarietywrote, "it was the script that never lived up to the promise of its premise."[37]
In 2013, Lee began development on a film dramatisingJoe FrazierandMuhammad Ali's heavyweight title fight, known as theThrilla in Manila. The film was to be produced by Universal with a screenplay written byPeter Morgan, but Lee later put it on hold in 2014 in order to makeBilly Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.[38][39][40]In December 2015, it was announced that the project, tentatively titledThrilla in Manila, now with Studio 8, would be his next film afterGemini Man.[41]David OyelowoandRay Fisherwere reportedly Lee's top choices for the leading roles of Frazier and Ali, respectively, and he hoped to film in 3D.[42]Lee announced in November 2022 that he is working on a biopic on the life ofBruce Leestarring his son,Mason Lee.[43]
Lee lives inLarchmont, inWestchester County,New York, with his wife, Jane Lin, amicrobiologistatNew York Medical College. They met in 1978 while both were studying at theUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The meeting occurred during a group of international students' trip toGary, Indianato watch theSenior League World SeriesChampionship, when the two sat next to each other on the bus. After five years of dating, they married in 1983. Following Lee’s graduation from theTisch School of the Arts, New York University, he was a stay-at-home father for six years, supported by Lin, until he won the prize from Taiwan'sGovernment Information Officeto make his first filmPushing Hands(1991).[44]They have two sons, includingMason.[45]Lee is sometimes described as anaturalizedUS citizen[46][47][48]but has said he is apermanent resident of the United States.[1][49]Lee has stated that he believes in theTaoist-Buddha.[50]

She later said, "I realized pretty early on that I was already too tall by the time I was 13... You know, your body has to stay that way for your entire life, and it's pretty hard on your muscles and your bones."[2]Realizing a dance career was unlikely, she turned to acting.[2]As she was still a teenager at the time, this required her to behomeschooledthrough most of high school.[7][8]
Winstead appeared in a production ofJoseph and the Amazing Technicolor DreamcoatstarringDonny Osmond.[9]After her brief performance in that show, Winstead began making appearances in various television series and earned guest roles inTouched by an AngelandPromised Land. She gained her first major role asJessica Bennettin theNBCsoap operaPassions, from 1999 to 2000. She left to pursue other interests, later stating, "I really had one of the smallest roles onPassions, so I didn't get too involved... I was able to leave pretty easily".[10]Winstead's next significant television role was in the short-livedCBSdrama seriesWolf Lake(2001–02), as the daughter ofTim Matheson's character.[11]The series was canceled after ten episodes. In 2004, Winstead played a supporting role inMTV'smade-for-televisionfilmMonster Island. She was offered a role in the filmA Cinderella Story, but turned it down as she had just graduated from school and was going on a cruise with friends (where she met Riley Stearns, her future husband).[12]

I was either the hero of the sidekicks or the sidekick to the heroes."[13]The film was released on July 29, 2005, receiving favorable reviews, and budgeted at US$35 million, it grossed US$63.9 million domestically.[14]
Winstead then began working with filmmakersJames WongandGlen Morgan, previously known for their contributions toThe X-Files.

It is the second film to feature Winstead with Russell (afterSky High), although she only filmed scenes with Dawson, Thoms, and Bell. The production under-performed commercially but attracted significant media buzz and critical acclaim,[27][28]Varietymagazine noted thatDeath Proof"proves its worth as a stand-alone feature" and found Winstead's "emergence" to be "one agreeable plus [to the movie]".[29][30]Her next film appearance of the year was oppositeBruce WillisinLive Free or Die Hard,[3]portrayingJohn McClane's estranged daughter,Lucy.

Winstead collaborated again with James Ponsoldt inThe Spectacular Now(2013) as Holly, the sister ofMiles Teller's lead character.[72]She appeared withBrie Larson, her co-star inScott Pilgrim vs. the World, and withShailene Woodley,Kyle Chandler, andBob Odenkirk.

Alex's gradual metamorphosis into a richer, more fully realized young woman is accomplished in hundreds of tiny emotional brushstrokes, flitting across her girl-next-door wholesomeness in ever-shifting patterns".[84]WebsiteTwitch Filmwrote:
[Winstead] has matured from her early roles in horror films, to more impressive fare such asSmashed. She has grace, courage, knows how to move the audience and the camera loves her. While her resume up 'til now is a mix of blockbusters (Final Destination 3,Live Free or Die Hard) and indie favorites (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World), this will change as she continues to grow into her profoundly blossoming career. This is an actress ready to do great things. As Alex, she always wears a look of determination, even when she's exhausted and losing the new battles thrown at her: learning how to be alone, taking care of her family and keeping the job she's worked her entire life for. Alex is a tender soul but does her damnedest to keep it together. It's an admirable trait not many can do, let alone be challenged with.[85]
