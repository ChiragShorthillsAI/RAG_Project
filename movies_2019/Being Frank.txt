Being Frankis a 2018 Americancomedy filmdirected byMiranda Baileyand written by Glen Lakin. The film starsJim Gaffigan,Logan Miller,Samantha Mathis,Alex KarpovskyandAnna Gunn. The film was released on June 14, 2019, byThe Film Arcade. The film received mixed reviews after its release.
Philip, a 17-year-old senior has dreams of being a musician, but his father sees his life much differently. Frank wants Philip to complete a summer internship at the family ketchup factory before attending a state college, despite the fact that Philip wants to attendNew York University. One night at dinner Philip asks his mother, Laura, if he can attend theStarlingFestival at the lake, since it is his final Spring Break of his high school life. Despite attending the festival with her husband almost two decades prior, she says no, much to Philip's dismay.
Philip is accepted into NYU, and Frank abruptly shuts him down, without a conversation. This greatly upsets Philip, so he decides to sneak out of the house the next day after his father has left for his long trip to Japan and his mother and sister, Lib have gone to aPETAevent. Lewis, Philip's friend, picks up Philip and they head off to the lake. Although Philip thinks they're going to be staying in a lake side cabin, they end up staying at Lewis' stoner uncle, Ross', shanty apartment.
Philip and Lewis head to the pool, and while Philip is busy admiring his high school crush Allison, Frank shows up at the pool. The boys scramble to hide from Frank as he walks up to and hugs the young waitress. Worried, the two boys follow Frank and the waitress to a house and sneak to the backyard where Philip is shocked again. This time he hugs an older woman and then a younger man. The three people turn out to be Bonnie, Kelly and Eddie (Frank's other wife, daughter and son, respectively). Philip is devastated and he and Lewis head back to Ross' apartment. The next day, Philip returns to Frank's other house and introduces himself as Richie's son; Richie being the name Frank has used to keep his wives off the trail. He is welcomed in with open arms.
Frank "returns" home from his "trip" to Japan and is shocked when he sees Philip in the wrong house. Later in the evening, Philip blackmails Frank into paying for his NYU tuition and Frank obliges, writing him a check. Philip spends the weekend with Frank's other family, even attending a party with Kelly and bonding with Eddie about their father (unbeknownst to Eddie). Not returning home on Monday, Laura gets worried and calls Lewis' mother to inquire the whereabouts of her son and learns that they went to the lake. Laura and Lib go to the lake the next day.
Lewis warns Philip and Frank about the impending arrival of Laura and Lib, but it's too late. Frank makes up a lie about not needing to be in Japan and not telling his wife why. The family decides to rent a cabin at the lake for the festival. The morning of the Starling Festival, Frank wakes up at Bonnie's cabin, but also needs to be at Laura's cabin at the same time so he goes for a "jog" but he actually flat out runs there. Eddie volunteers to go with, but Frank says he wants to be alone, leaving Eddie feeling confused and rejected.
Frank's arrival at Laura's rental confuses her and Lib, as he is completely soaked from the sweat. Philip sends the girls to the festival, not knowing that Frank had already sent Bonnie, Kelly and Eddie down to the festival as well. Philip and Frank are dumbfounded, trying to figure out how to keep the two families from bumping into each other. Ironically, Ross appears with a powerboat at that exact moment and gets them to the festival in a fraction of the time.
Philip and Frank arrive and split up to distract the two wives. Before Philip can reach his mother, he is cut off by Kelly, who wants to reveal her feelings for him. Kelly won't listen to Philip and leans in to kiss him, as Frank stops it before she is able to. Frank then reveals the whole truth about his affair. Thinking he can distract Laura and Bonnie from being too upset at his father, Philip thinks of an off-hand remark Frank said about heaving himself into oncoming traffic. Before a car strikes Philip, Frank pushes him out of the way. Doing this, though, put them in front of another car going in the other direction, driven by Stan and Marcy Kempler (two friends of Bonnie and Frank). Not knowing if they killed Philip and Frank, they speed away.
Philip and Frank end up in the hospital. Philip is released after only sustaining bumps and bruises, but Frank is admitted having suffered broken ribs and a broken leg, with a few minor injuries. Laura leaves the hospital without seeing Frank, removing her wedding ring in the car, signifying the end of her marriage. Bonnie and all four children enter Frank's hospital room and confront him about the pain he's caused. Everyone leaves the room, with Philip trailing, having finally connected to his father in a way he always desired.
Five months later, Philip is moving into his dorm room when Kelly comes to see him, letting him know they'll be neighbors. Frank and Bonnie end up sharing an elevator, with Bonnie stating she'd rather he "take the window". Frank enters Philip's room and Kelly leaves immediately, not ready to mend her relationship with her father. Frank then presents his father's guitar to Philip, explaining that the guitar never really belonged to him. This also serves as a blessing for Philip to pursue music as a career. Philip and Frank embrace in a hug and then Frank leaves, only to linger outside the dorm room and listen to Philip play his new guitar.

James Christopher Gaffigan(born July 7, 1966) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and producer. His material often addresses fatherhood, laziness, food, religion, and general observations. He is regarded as a "clean" comic, using little profanity in his routines, although he does use it from time to time.[1]He has released several successful comedy specials, includingMr. Universe,Obsessed,Cinco, andQuality Time, all of which have receivedGrammynominations.
Gaffigan's memoirDad Is Fat(2013) and his most recent bookFood: A Love Story(2014) were both published byCrown Publishers. He co-created and starred in theTV LandseriesThe Jim Gaffigan Show, based on his life. He collaborates extensively with his wife, actressJeannie Gaffigan, with whom he has five children.
Gaffigan was born on July 7, 1966,[2]inElgin, Illinois,[3]the youngest of six children born to charity worker and fundraiser Marcia Miriam (n√©e Mitchell) and banker Michael Ambrose Gaffigan.[4][5]Of Irish descent, his family's surname was Gavahan.[5]His maternal grandfather wasIowa Supreme CourtJusticeRichard F. Mitchell.[5]Gaffigan was raised inChestertoninNorthwest Indiana, a region that he has stated influenced his comedy because of its authenticity,[6]and often jokes about growing up in a large family.[7]His mother was accomplished atneedleworkand received a national award for original design and craftsmanship from the American Needlepoint Guild in 1985.[8]She died of cancer in 1990 at age 53.[8]
Gaffigan's father was the president and CEO of the Mercantile National Bank of Indiana for 15 years until his retirement in 1991.[9]A formerseminarian, he was also actively involved in local charity work.[10]He died oflung cancerin 1999.[10]Gaffigan's father was the first in his family to attend college,[11]and encouraged his children to seek careers that promised job security.[12]However, at about the age of five, Gaffigan announced that he wanted to be an actor.[13]
As a teenager, Gaffigan watchedSaturday Night Live.[11]He attendedLa Lumiere SchoolinLa Porte, Indiana, where he played on the school'sfootballteam. He attendedPurdue Universityfor one year, where he was a member of thePhi Gamma Deltafraternity, before transferring toGeorgetown University'sMcDonough School of Business, where he graduated in 1988 with a degree in finance.[12][14]He played football atGeorgetownandPurdue.[15][16]Although he "hated" studying finance, he worked as a litigation consultant for a short time after graduating and "was horrible at it".[17]
Gaffigan moved to New York in 1990 to pursue comedy,[14]a move that was inspired by his admiration for fellowHoosierDavid Letterman.[18]He worked in advertising during the day[12]and took acting classes at night.[7][18]During this time, he was cast inBlockbuster Video's"Entertainment Squad" series of commercials.[19]His career began in earnest when a friend from his acting class dared him to take astand-upseminar that required a live set at the end.[7][13]He fell in love with stand-up,[7]and began playing comedy clubs nightly‚Äîafter his evening acting classes‚Äîuntil the early hours of the morning.[18]He was often found sleeping at his day job; his boss had to wake him up to fire him.[18]
For the first seven years of Gaffigan's stand-up career, he tried various styles, ranging from angry comedy to impressions and voices. Live comedy was in decline following its peak in the 1980s, and was further affected by the increased popularity ofcable television.[7]After periodically auditioning forThe Late Show with David Lettermanfor six years,[20]Gaffigan did a successful stand-up routine on the show in 1999,[21][22]and his career took off.[18]
Gaffigan's style is largelyobservational. Some of his main topics are laziness, eating and parenthood. His famousHot Pocketroutine was inspired by a commercial he saw that he mistook for aSaturday Night Livesketch.[13]He often performssoliloquies. For example, in high-pitched voice, he may portray someone giving negative feedback on his own performance (After he made a diarrhea joke in his 2012 special "Mr. Universe", he used the voice to say, "Really, he's using diarrhea jokes?"[23]). He has said, "That inside voice is my connection with the audience".[13]
In an interview with theDuluth News-Tribune, he explained that he began developing the voice as a teenager, when he disarmed people by talking for them in their presence.[24]He said he also used it to fend off hecklers earlier in his career, when comedy clubs were more "combative".[24]He cursed early in his career, and added cursing to his comedy albumDoing My Timeat the request of his label, in the hopes of drawing more teens.[25]He has now largely removed profanity from his routine, as he feels his subject matter doesn't lend itself to cursing and that it reduced the effort he put into crafting his jokes.[25][26]
In 2004, Gaffigan's stand-up material was featured inComedy Central's animated seriesShorties Watchin' Shorties. In October 2005, he filmed a liveComedy Centralspecial that aired the following January,[7]and became the comedy album/DVDBeyond the Pale. The routine consisted primarily of material regarding food and American eating habits, and the comedian unknowingly predicted a future menu item atDunkin Donuts‚Äîthe "glazed donut breakfast sandwich"‚Äîwhile commenting on the future of America's eating habits.[27]His 2009 albumKing Babywas also a television special filmed inAustin, Texas, at the end of his "The Sexy Tour". Comedy Central releasedKing Babyon DVD. In a March 2009 interview onAnytime with Bob Kushell, Gaffigan defended his naming of the tour, stating that he thought it would be funny that parents would be unsure about whether to bring their teenage children to the show.[28]Four years later, on March 14, 2013, Gaffigan was named the "King of Clean" by theWall Street Journal.[29]
On February 25, 2012, Gaffigan taped a one-hour stand-up special‚ÄîMr. Universe‚Äîat theWarner TheaterinWashington, D.C.;[30]it was nominated for a Grammy.[12]He announced that, based on the business model used byLouis C.K.'sLive at the Beacon Theater, the stand-up would be available online through his website for $5, with 20% of the total proceeds going to theBob Woodruff Foundation,[31]an organization that provides support to military veterans.[32]In 2012, he was among the top-ten grossing comics in the US, according to Pollstar.[12]
Gaffigan filmed his 2014 comedy special titledJim Gaffigan: ObsessedatBoston'sWilbur Theateron January 18, 2014.[33]Obsessedpremiered onComedy Centralon April 27 becoming the most watched stand-up comedy special of the year for the network.[34]The accompanying album, also titledObsessed, debuted at number 11 on theBillboard200and number 1 on the Billboard Comedy Album charts.[35]2015 saw him embark on a headlining tour, culminating in a winter show atMadison Square Garden.[11]

Gaffigan is widely noted as aneverymanand a clean comic;[12][42]some of his signature routines regardHot Pockets,[42][43]cake, andbacon.[23]His tendency to avoid profanity has drawn mixed responses. One critic compared him toFull House-eraBob Saget(who starred in the 1990s family show), which Gaffigan took as an insult.[25]Hampton Stevens inThe Atlanticwrote that Gaffigan "champions a vital element to standup that[Lenny] Brucehad taken away‚Äîthe indispensable, but apparently forgotten idea that comedians have no obligation to be provocative, topical, socially conscious, or anything else but funny."[23]
I did my set, I walked off stage and they said the executive producer wants to meet you up in his office. I thought maybe it was going to be something good. I thought maybe Dave wants me to be a writer. But they wanted me to develop my ownshow.
As Gaffigan's comedy career stalled in the 1990s, a friend suggested he audition for commercials, a move that turned out to be profitable.[7]He has appeared in over 200 TV commercials,[25]ranging fromRolling RocktoSaturntoChryslerandESPN. His ubiquity earned him the title of 'Salesman of the Year' byBusinessWeekin 1999.[44]He also performed in a trio of Sierra Mist commercials for the2007 Super Bowlas part of the comedy ensemble "The Mis-Takes".[45][46]He appeared in an ad series forSierra Mistalongside fellow comedianMichael Ian Black.[47]

Gaffigan starred inShia LaBeouf's 2013 short filmHoward Cantour.com, the content of which was later revealed to be mostly plagiarized from Daniel Clowes's 2007 graphic novellaJustin M. Damiano.[53]Reflecting on the incident in an interview forThe Daily Beast, Gaffigan said, "There's no greater sin in the stand-up world than thievery...So you do not want to be associated with thievery," but added, "I don't have any hard feelings about it because I don't think people think I had anything to do with it."[11]
In the 2010s, Gaffigan, his wife, andPeter Tolanbegan to develop material for a show based loosely on their own life.
