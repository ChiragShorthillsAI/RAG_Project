The long list of Sutherland's roles and accomplishments shows a man who understood emotion well. But it's this marriage of suspicion and empathy, human feeling and the fear of humanity gone wrong, that secured his place in acting history and made him an uncommon kind of star. He didn't disappear into a role, not exactly; he was too distinctive for that. More often, the role disappeared into him, and the result was something unforgettable".
Helen Mirrennamed Sutherland as "one of the smartest actors I ever worked with. He had a wonderful enquiring brain and a great knowledge of a wide variety of subjects. He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity, and with seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became."[156]David Oyelowo, who worked with Sutherland on what became his final performance inLawmen: Bass Reeves,stated that "Given the iconic status he rightly achieved, having a front row seat to Donald Sutherland's last onscreen performance was both a privilege and clear evidence to me of his deep passion for the craft of acting. The glint in his eye was that of an inquisitive, hungry artist still on the hunt for the truth. Seeing that glint, up close, in the eyes of a legend was something to behold."[157]Jane Fonda, who worked with Sutherland on the 1971 filmKlute, wrote: "Donald was a brilliant actor and a complex man who shared quite a few adventures with me, such as theFTA Show, an anti-Vietnam war tour that performed for 60,000 active duty soldiers, sailors, and marines in Hawaii, Okinawa, the Philippines, and Japan in 1971. I am heartbroken."[158]
Sutherland'sBBCobituary says that the "late Donald Sutherland cast a literal and figurative shadow over his industry for almost 50 years".[159]The Guardian'sPeter Bradshawwrote that "Sutherland was an utterly unique actor and irreplaceable star" and "was an aristocrat of screen actors".[160]Variety'sOwen Gleibermanwrote that "in 1970, Donald Sutherland ... was the coolest movie star on the planet. The moment I saw him in "MASH," I knew he was the person I wanted to be, the same way that I wanted to beMick JaggerorSteve McQueen".[161]Canadian Prime MinisterJustin Trudeaustated, "He was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft, and truly a great Canadian artist and he will be deeply missed."[162]
Over his career he receivednumerous accoladesincluding aPrimetime Emmy Award, aGolden Globe Award, and anAcademy Honorary Award. He received theCommandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettresin 2012, and the Companion of the Order of Canada (CC) in 2019.
