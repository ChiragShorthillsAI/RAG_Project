She is still a slow reader and cannot read out loud.[11]Knightley has said she was "single-minded about acting".[12]At age three, she requested to obtain an agent like her parents and secured one at six.

The film's release was delayed on several occasions and, on its eventual release in November, it received negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office.[51]
