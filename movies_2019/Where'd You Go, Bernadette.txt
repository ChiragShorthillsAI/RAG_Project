Where'd You Go, Bernadettewas released on August 16, 2019, byAnnapurna Picturesthrough theirUnited Artists Releasingjoint venture. It received mixed reviews from critics.
Architect-turned-agoraphobeBernadette Fox is settled down with her husband Elgie Branch and their 15-year-old daughter Bee in a dilapidated former schoolhouse inSeattle. After an award-winning house Bernadette constructed was demolished, she developed severe depression and became reclusive. Despite her close relationship with Bee, Bernadette seldom leaves home and harbors a deep fear of human interaction, including with the other parents at Bee's school and especially their neighbor, Audrey Griffin.
Bee requests a family trip toAntarcticaas a reward for good grades, to which her parents reluctantly agree. As the trip approaches, Bernadette’s behavior becomes increasingly odd. She considers using various prescription drugs to control her worsening anxiety and insomnia. Audrey continually implores Bernadette to remove an invasive blackberry plant from the hillside above her house; when Bernadette complies, the hillside collapses into Audrey's garden and house during a rainstorm. Elgie claims Bernadette knew that the hill would collapse without the blackberries to hold it in place. Audrey later dishonestly accuses Bernadette of driving over her foot, escalating the tension between them.
One day, Bernadette returns home to find Elgie, his assistant Soo-Lin, psychiatrist Dr. Kurtz, and FBI Agent Strang at her home for an intervention. They reveal that Manjula, Bernadette's “personal assistant” in India with whom she has shared all of her personal and financial information, is actually a front for a Russian criminal organization that the FBI has been watching. Dr. Kurtz and Elgie want to commit Bernadette to a psychiatric hospital while Elgie and Bee go to Antarctica. Feeling ambushed and misunderstood, Bernadette sneaks out of the house and hides at Audrey's, who makes amends with her and helps her fly to Antarctica alone.
Elgie and Bee pursue Bernadette after Agent Strang tells them that the Russian criminals, who were on their way to Seattle to defraud Bernadette while she and her family were away, have been arrested and are no longer a threat. In Antarctica, Bernadette befriends Becky, a researcher who tells her that theresearch station at the South Polemust be completely rebuilt and needs an architect. Bernadette sneaks off her cruise ship and intoPalmer Station, and convinces the team leader to give her a spot on the next convoy to theSouth Pole.
Elgie realizes that he has failed Bernadette by not being more supportive of her creativity. He and Bee catch up with Bernadette at Palmer Station and, seeing that her passion for architecture has been reignited, give her their blessing to spend five weeks at the Pole.

OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 50% based on 191 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.

Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film 2 out of 4 stars and wrote: "Filmed in a solid but straightforward style, populated by troubled characters who are aggressively off-putting, frustratingly passive and/or easily lampooned clichés,Where'd You Go, Bernadetteis one of the most disappointing movies of 2019."[29]In his 1/4 star review forThe Globe and Mail, Barry Hertz said, "There is, buried deep somewhere in Linklater's film or however many edits it may have undergone – the thing reeks of indecision – an insightful, even invigorating story about what happens to a creative genius once they stop creating. But the actual work presents a good argument that, for some artists, it might be best to quit while you're ahead."[30]
Two of Bernadette's structures — the fictitious Twenty-Mile House and Beeber Bifocal House — were compared to the first two of 18 visions ofBernadette Soubirous.
Her final conception in the film was based on theHalley Research Station, designed in real life byHugh Broughton Architects.

Richard Stuart Linklater(/ˈlɪŋkleɪtər/; born July 30, 1960)[2]is an American filmmaker. He is known for making films that deal thematically withsuburban cultureand the effects of thepassage of time. In 2015, Linklater was included on the annualTime100 list of the most influential people in the world.[3]
His films include the comediesSlacker(1990) andDazed and Confused(1993); theBeforetrilogyof romance films:Before Sunrise(1995),Before Sunset(2004), andBefore Midnight(2013); the music-themed comedySchool of Rock(2003); theadult animatedfilmsWaking Life(2001),A Scanner Darkly(2006), andApollo 10½: A Space Age Childhood(2022); the coming-of-age dramaBoyhood(2014); the comedy filmEverybody Wants Some!!(2016); and the romantic comedyHit Man(2023).
Many of Linklater's films are noted for their loosely structured narratives. TheBeforetrilogy andBoyhoodboth feature the same actors filmed over an extended period of years. He has received fiveAcademy Awardnominations and won theSilver Bear for Best DirectorforBefore Sunrise. He also won aGolden Globe Awardfor directingBoyhood.
Linklater was born inHouston, Texas, the son of Diane Margaret (née Krieger), who taught atSam Houston State University, and Charles W. Linklater, III.[4][5]He attendedHuntsville High SchoolinHuntsville, Texas, during grades 9–11, where he played football forJoe Clementsas a backup quarterback for the #1 ranked team in the state. For his senior year, he moved toBellaire High SchoolinBellaire, Texas, because he was better at baseball than football and Bellaire had a better baseball coach. As a teen he won aScholastic Art and Writing Award.[6][7]
Linklater studied atSam Houston State University(where he also played baseball),[8]until dropping out to work on anoffshore oil rigin theGulf of Mexico.
He frequently read novels on the rig, and upon returning to land, developed a love of film through repeated visits to arepertory cinemain Houston. At this point, Linklater realized he wanted to be a filmmaker. He used his savings to buy aSuper-8camera, a projector, and editing equipment, and moved toAustin, Texas.[9]
Linklater founded theAustin Film Societyin 1985 with his college professor Chale Nafus,University of Texasprofessor Charles Ramirez-Berg,SXSWfounderLouis Black, and his frequent collaboratorLee Daniel. One of the mentors for the Film Society was former New York City critic for theSoHo Weekly NewsGeorge Morris, who had relocated to Austin and taught film there.
For several years, Linklater made many short films that were exercises and experiments in film techniques. He finally completed his first feature,It's Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books(which is available inThe Criterion Collectionedition of his second feature,Slacker), a Super-8 feature that took a year to shoot and another year to edit.
Linklater created Detour Filmproduction (an homage to the1945 low budgetfilm noirbyEdgar G. Ulmer), and subsequently madeSlackerfor only $23,000. It went on to gross more than $1.25 million. The film shows an aimless day in the life of the city of Austin, Texas showcasing its more eccentric characters.
While gaining a cult following in theindependent filmworld, he made his third film,Dazed and Confused, based on his years at Huntsville High School and the people he encountered there. The film garnered critical praise and grossed $8 million in the United States while becoming a hit on VHS. This film was also responsible for the breakout of fellow Texas nativeMatthew McConaughey.
In 1995, Linklater won theSilver Bear for Best Directorfor the filmBefore Sunriseat the45th Berlin International Film Festival.[10]His next feature,subUrbia, had mixed reviews critically, and did very poorly at the box office. In 1998, he took on his first Hollywood feature,The Newton Boys, which received mixed reviews while tanking at the box office.
With therotoscopefilmsWaking LifeandA Scanner Darkly, and his mainstream comedies,School of Rockand the remake ofBad News Bears, he gained wider recognition.
In 2003, he wrote and directed a pilot forHBOwithRodney Rothmancalled$5.15/hr, about severalminimum wagerestaurant workers. The pilot deals with themes later examined inFast Food Nation.
The British television network Channel 4 produced a documentary about Linklater, in which the filmmaker discussed the personal and philosophical ideas behind his films.St Richard of Austinwas presented by Ben Lewis and directed byIrshad Ashrafand broadcast on Channel 4 in December 2004 in the UK.
Linklater was nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Adapted Screenplayfor his filmBefore Sunset.
Waking LifeandA Scanner Darklyboth usedrotoscopinganimation techniques. Working withBob Sabistonand Sabiston's programRotoshopto create this effect, Linklater shot and edited both movies completely as live-action features, then employed a team of artists to "trace over" individual frames. The result is a distinctive "semi-real" quality, praised by such critics asRoger Ebert(in the case ofWaking Life) as being original and well-suited to the aims of the film.
Fast Food Nation(2006) is an adaptation of the best selling book that examines the local and global influence of the United States fast food industry. The film was entered into the2006 Cannes Film Festival[11]before being released in North America on November 17, 2006, and in Europe on March 23, 2007. The film received mixed reviews.
Linklater fared better with the critics withA Scanner Darkly(released in the same year),Me and Orson Welles(2009), andBernie(2011).[12]
He was nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Adapted ScreenplayforBefore Midnight, the third film in theBefore...trilogy.[13]

Linklater won theGolden Globes,Critics' Choice Movie Awards, andBAFTAsfor Best Director and Best Picture. He also received his first nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Director, along with nominations forBest Original ScreenplayandBest Picture.
For a while Linklater was attached to direct a remake ofThe Incredible Mr. LimpetforWarner Bros.[15]However, he dropped the project in favor of working on a spiritual successor toDazed and Confused, titledEverybody Wants Some!!,[15]with backing fromAnnapurna PicturesandParamountdistributing the film in North America.[16]The film was released in March 2016 and was well received by critics, but it failed to recoup its budget of 10 million dollars, grossing only 4.6 million.[17][18]
In the second half of the 2010s, Linklater wrote and directed the drama filmLast Flag Flying, starringBryan Cranston,Laurence Fishburne, andSteve Carell. A sequel toHal Ashby's 1973 filmThe Last Detail, it began filming in November 2016, and was released on November 3, 2017.[19]Linklater then directedWhere'd You Go, Bernadette, based on the novel byMaria Sempleand produced byAnnapurna Pictures.[20]
Linklater was attached to direct an adaptation ofGraeme Simsion's novelThe Rosie Projectthat would have starredJennifer Lawrencein the lead role, but he dropped out of directing when Lawrence dropped out of the project.[21]
In 2019, it was announced that Linklater would be filmingan adaptationofStephen Sondheim's musicalMerrily We Roll Along. LikeBoyhood, it will be filmed over the course of several years, but, like the musical andthe play it is based on, will be presented inreverse chronology.[22]
In 2024, Linklater directed an episode ofGod Save TexasforHBO, focusing on theprison industrial complexinHuntsville, Texas.[23]
Inspiration for Linklater's work was largely based on his experience viewing the filmRaging Bull.[24][25]
It made me see movies as a potential outlet for what I was thinking about and hoping to express. At that point I was an unformed artist. At that moment, something was simmering in me, butRaging Bullbrought it to a boil.[26]
He was also influenced byRobert Bresson,Yasujirō Ozu,Rainer Werner Fassbinder,Eric Rohmer,François Truffaut,Josef Von Sternberg, andCarl Theodor Dreyer.[27][28]
Many of Linklater's films, includingSlacker,Dazed and Confused,Tape, and all three installments of theBefore Trilogy, take place in a single day. They are less plot-driven and more about human interactions.[29]
Linklater lives inAustin, Texas, and refuses to live or work in Hollywood for any extended period of time.

We're regressing, clawing at the walls as if to say, I don't want to grow up."[119]The film starsAllison Janney,Katie Holmes,Bradley Whitford,Jennifer Garner(Greer's co-star from13 Going on 30) and rapperCommon, and received largely negative reviews from critics.[120]

Liam Matthews ofTVGuidefelt that Greer "perfectly played [Askey] with spiteful ineptitude," whereas Gwen Ihnat ofThe A.V. Clubdescribed Greer's performance as "uncharacteristically wily [...] refusing to admit that she may have fingered the wrong guy and crafting any number of implausible theories to make that accusation stick.[172][173]The series garnered strong ratings forNBC, and Greer received aHollywood Critics Associationaward nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Broadcast Network or Cable Limited Series.[174][175]InShowtime'sThe First Lady, Greer replacedPamela Adlonas Nancy Howe, the personal confidant of First LadyBetty Ford(Michelle Pfeiffer).[176]While the series received mixed reviews, Meghan O'Keefe published an article onDeciderasserting that Greer "[almost] single-handedly" saved the series, further stating that "Greer might be the only actor in the whole cast who is able to make the didactic, obvious dialogue sound natural and fun."[177][178]

Greer joined the cast of theHBOminiseriesWhite House Plumbers, which depicts theWatergate scandal. Greer was cast as Fran Liddy, the wife ofG.
