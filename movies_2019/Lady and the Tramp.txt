Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle. Its first film appearance was with the release ofStrange World.[60]The logo received widespread praise from critics and audiences and won Gold in the "Theatrical | Film: Design" medium at the 2023Clio Entertainment Awardsin November 2023. The standard version of the logo premiered theatrically withThe Beach Boys.[61]

Andrew Bujalski(/bʊˈdʒælski/;[1]born April 29, 1977)[2]is an Americanfilm director,screenwriterandactor, who has been called the "godfather ofmumblecore."[3][4]
Bujalski, born in Boston in 1977, is the son of artist-turned-businesswoman Sheila Dubman and businessman Edmund Bujalski. His father is Catholic and his mother is Jewish.[5]He grew up inNewton, Massachusetts,[6]where he attended the same high school asBeeswaxcollaboratorAlex Karpovsky(although the two didn't know each other at the time).[7]Bujalski studied film atHarvard's Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, where theBelgianfilmmakerChantal Akermanwas histhesis advisor.
He shot his first feature,Funny Ha Ha, in 2002 and followed it withMutual Appreciationin 2003. They received theatrical distribution in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Bujalski wrote both screenplays and appears as an actor, playing a major role in both films. In 2006 he appeared as an actor and contributed to the screenplay of theJoe SwanbergfilmHannah Takes the Stairs.
BeeswaxandComputer Chess, Bujalski's third and fourth films, were filmed in Austin, where the director lives.Beeswaxwas released in summer 2009. While making it Bujalski wrote ascreenplayadaptation ofBenjamin Kunkel's 2005 novelIndecisionforParamount Pictures.
His fourth feature,Computer Chess,[8][9]is aperiod filmset at acomputer programmingtournament in 1980. It premiered at the 2013Sundance Film Festivaland won the Alfred Sloan Feature Film Prize.[10]It is his first featureedited digitallyand the only feature film shot almost exclusively with originalSony1968 AVC-3260 B&W video cameras.[11]
Bujalski married Karen Olsson in 2009. They have two children.[12]
Bujalski also has worked as a writer on several studio projects, including, most recently, the live-action remake of Disney’sLady and the Tramp.[13]
Bujalski's rough-edged, realistic films are often compared to the works of directorsJohn Cassavetes,Maurice PialatandMike Leigh.[14]All of his feature films were photographed by Austrian cinematographerMatthias Grunsky. The first three are shot on hand-held16mm, have a sometimes decidedly "lo-fi" feel (reinforced byFunny Ha Ha's distortedmono sound), and are often classified asmumblecore. The actors are non-professionals, many drawn from other media, including animatorKate Dollenmayeras the lead inFunny Ha Ha, musicianJustin Riceas the lead inMutual Appreciationand experimental filmmakerBill Morrisonin a supporting role in the same film.Funny Ha Hafeatured a cast and crew of Harvard alumni.[15]
Though his films often appearimprovised, they are for the most partscripted; the dialogue is often noted for its drawn-out, awkward nature, and characters frequently evade key topics. Many of the films seem to start and endin medias res, giving the films a "slice of life" feeling that suggests a larger narrative or world that the audience is looking in on.
The characters in Bujalski's films are mostlymiddle-class. The desire for stability is a recurring theme, and many characters rush headlong into attempts at a more controlled existence; one of the main characters inFunny Ha Haelopes with his ex-girlfriend.

There was a lot of confusion and nonsense where I grew up, so I reacted by creating my own little world.[...] I began to see how music could change lives, and I began to dream about a world where every day was like anime and Broadway, where music fell from the sky and anything could happen.
Janelle Monáe Robinson was born on December 1, 1985, inKansas City, Kansas, and was raised inQuindaro, a working-class community of Kansas City.[23]Her mother, Janet, worked as a janitor and a hotel maid.[23][24]Her father, Michael Robinson Summers, was a truck driver.[25]Monáe's parents separated when Monáe was a toddler and her mother later married a postal worker. Monáe has a younger sister, Kimmy, from her mother's remarriage.[23]
Monáe was raisedBaptistand learned to sing at a local church. Her family members were musicians and performers at the localAfrican Methodist Episcopalchurch, theBaptist church, and theChurch of God in Christ.[23][25]Monáe dreamed of being a singer and a performer from a very young age,[22]and has cited the fictional character ofDorothy GalefromThe Wizard of Ozas a musical influence.[26]The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which Monáe bought two copies of with her first check, was another source of inspiration.[27]She performed songs from the album onJuneteenthtalent shows, winning three years in a row.[23]
As a teenager, Monáe was enrolled in the Coterie Theater's Young Playwrights' Round Table,[28][29]which began writing musicals. One musical, completed when she was around the age of 12, was inspired by the 1979Stevie WonderalbumJourney Through "The Secret Life of Plants".[29]
Monáe attendedF. L. Schlagle High School,[25]and after high school, moved toNew York Cityto study musical theater at theAmerican Musical and Dramatic Academy, where she was the only black woman in her class.[28][29]Monáe enjoyed the experience, but feared that she might lose her edge and "sound, or look or feel like anybody else".[28]In a 2010 interview Monáe explained, "I felt like that was a home but I wanted to write my own musicals. I didn't want to have to live vicariously through a character that had been played thousands of times – in a line with everybody wanting to play the same person."[29]
After a year and a half, Monáe dropped out of the academy and relocated toAtlanta, enrolling atGeorgia Perimeter College. She began writing her own music and performing around the campus.[28]In 2003, Monáe self-released ademo albumtitledThe Audition,[30]which she sold out of the trunk of aMitsubishi Galant.[28]During this period she worked at anOffice Depotbut was fired for answering a fan's e-mail using a company computer, an incident that inspired the song "Lettin' Go", which in turn attracted the attention ofBig Boi.[29]
Monáe appeared on thePurple Ribbon All-StarsalbumGot Purp? Vol. 2as well as on OutKast's 2006 albumIdlewild, where she was featured on the songs "Call the Law" and "In Your Dreams".[31]Big Boi told his friendSean Combsabout Monáe, of whom at the time Combs had not yet heard. Combs soon visited Monáe'sMySpacepage and according to aHitQuartersinterview withBad Boy RecordsA&R person Daniel 'Skid' Mitchell, Combs loved it right away: "[He] loved her look, loved that you couldn't see her body, loved the way she was dancing, and just loved the vibe. He felt like she has something that was different – something new and fresh."[32]
Monáe signed to the label, Bad Boy, in 2006. The label's chief role was to facilitate her exposure on a much broader scale rather than develop the artist and her music, as Mitchell noted: "She was already moving, she already had her records – she had a self-contained movement." Combs and Big Boi wanted to take their time and build her profile organically and allow the music to grow rather than put out "a hot single which everyone jumps on, and then they fade because it's just something of the moment."[32]
In 2007, Monáe released her first solo work,Metropolis.It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or "suites", which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series,Metropolis: Suite I (The Chase)in mid-2007, these plans were altered following signing with Sean Combs's label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitledMetropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition)and included two new tracks. The EP was critically acclaimed, garnering Monáe a 51st Annual Grammy AwardsGrammynomination forBest Urban/Alternative Performancefor the single "Many Moons",[33]festival appearances and opening slots forindie popbandof Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for bandNo Doubton their summer 2009 tour.[34]Her single "Open Happiness" was featured in the 2009 season finale ofAmerican Idol.[35]Monáe told MTV about the concept for her new album and also discussed analter egonamed Cindi Mayweather. She said:
Cindy is an android and I love speaking about the android because they are the new "other". People are afraid of the other and I believe we're going to live in a world with androids because of technology and the way it advances. The first album she was running because she had fallen in love with a human and she was being disassembled for that.[36]
In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album,The ArchAndroid. The album was released on May 18, 2010. The second and third suites ofMetropolisare combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter ego, Cindi Mayweather – also the protagonist ofMetropolis: The Chase Suite– becomes amessianicfigure to theandroidcommunity of Metropolis.[37]Monáe announced plans to shoot a video for each song onThe ArchAndroidand create a film,graphic noveland a touring Broadway musical based on the album.[38]TheMetropolisconcept series draws inspiration from a wide range of musical, cinematic and other sources, ranging fromAlfred HitchcocktoDebussytoPhilip K. Dick. The series puts Fritz Lang's 1927 silent filmMetropolis, which Monáe referred to as "the godfather of science-fiction movies", in special regard.[39][40]Aside from sharing a name, they also share visual styles (the cover forThe ArchAndroidis inspired by the iconic poster forMetropolis), conceptual themes and political goals, using expressionistic future scenarios to examine and explore contemporary ideas of prejudice and class. Both also include a performing female android, though to very different effect. WhereMetropolisandroid Maria is the evil, havoc-sowing double of the messianic figure to the city's strictly segregated working class, Monáe's messianic android muse Cindi Mayweather represents an interpretation of androids as that segregated minority, which Monáe describes as "...theOther. And I feel like all of us, whether in the majority or the minority, felt like the Other at some point."[39][41]
Monáe received the Vanguard Award from theAmerican Society of Composers, Authors and Publishersat the Rhythm & Soul Music Awards in 2010.[42]Monáe coveredCharlie Chaplin'sSmileon Billboard.com in June 2010.

She's like theArchangelin theBible, and whatNeorepresents toThe Matrix."[137]In hersecond album, Cindi Mayweather returned to Earth to liberate Metropolitans from the Great Divide, an oppressive oligarchy that used time travel to "suppress freedom and love".[138]Chris Champion ofThe ObserverdescribedMetropolisandThe ArchAndroidas "psychedelic soulwith a sci-fi twist".[139]Matthew Valnes describes Monáe as innovating a more contemporary Neo-Afrofuturism, where the android role is used as a tool to critique the representation of Black female musicians in the funk genre. Funk music of 1960s through 1980s is a prevalent music style influencing Monáe. The website for Monáe's Wondaland Arts Society Collective asserts, "We believe there are only three forms of music; good music, bad music, and funk."[134]Monáe has also referred to herself as a "funkstress".[140]
Monáe's roots in Kansas City, Kansas, where she was born and raised, are evident in her lyrics and style. According to Carrie Battan'sPitchforkfeature on Monáe, the song "Ghetto Woman" directly addresses Monáe's working-class K.C., Kansas mother – as well as the portrayal of working-class black women in U.S. culture – with the line "Carry on, ghetto woman, even when the news portrays you less than you could be."[1]Monáe also told theLondon Evening Standardshe has internalized her KCK (K.C., KS) roots by wearing the working-class uniform of her parents and expressing concern that she cannot let "her community down".[141]On the albumThe ArchAndroid, especially in songs like "Cold War" or "BabopbyeYa", Monáe relates "the dystopian cityscapes depicted in Metropolis to the boarded-up projects of poverty-wracked Kansas".[142]Kansas City, therefore, not only represents Monáe's physical roots within her hometown, but also serves as an important influence on the lyrics and science-fictional setting.
I feel like I have a responsibility to my community and other young girls to help redefine what it looks like to be a woman. I don't believe in men's wear or women's wear, I just like what I like. And I think we should just be respected for being an individual... I've been inVogue, now, and different publications, which is cool, because I think that it just shows a different perspective of how women can dress.
Monáe's signature style is hertuxedowardrobe. She said "I bathe in it, I swim in it, and I could be buried in it. A tux is such a standard uniform, it's so classy and it's a lifestyle I enjoy. The tux keeps me balanced. I look at myself as a canvas. I don't want to cloud myself with too many colors or I'll go crazy. It's an experiment I'm doing. I think I want to be in the Guinness Book of World Records."[143]Monáe's signature look harkens back todandyism.[144]CitingGrace JonesandJosephine Bakeras role models, Monáe takes the classical 18th-century look in the classical white and black pattern.[145]Monáe's signature look can also be attributed to the early days in her career, when she was employed as a maid. She mentioned this in her acceptance speech for the "Young, Gifted, and Black" award at the 2012Black Girls Rock!ceremony.[146]Monáe has been known to distribute theTen Droid Commandments, which encourages her fans to be individuals.[137]The Telegraphalso commented on her image as an artist, saying, "Sitting in a grey, airless record company office, this slight, stiff young woman delivers her speech in slow, deliberate tones, utterly expressionless. Dressed in her trademark starched shirt and tuxedo, hair immaculately coiffed, Monáe's face is an opaque mask of perfection: all silken smooth skin, button nose and glassy brown eyes."[132]Monáe describes tuxedos as a uniform for her career, speaks of wanting to redefine how women dress,[137]and has been featured in the "Style 100" ofInStylemagazine.[147]TheCouncil of Fashion Designers of America Awardshonored Monáe with the Board of Directors' Tribute and the American Ingenuity Award for her "straoridanra ability to experiment in fashion".[148][149]
When it comes to her acting career, Monáe expressed desire to shape it around that ofJohnny Depp, stating that he has a very vast career: "The amount of roles:Willy WonkatoSweeney Toddto all of the dramatic roles. Whatever the Janelle Monáe version of that is. Maybe something even better..."[150]
During a 2011 interview withLondon Evening Standard, Monáe said she "only dates androids", a reference to her musical alter ego found in many of her songs. She also said, "I speak about androids because I think the android represents the new 'other'. You can compare it to being a lesbian or being a gay man or being a Black woman... what I want is for people who feel oppressed or feel like the 'other' to connect with the music and to feel like, 'She represents who I am.'" She added that she would talk about her sexual orientation "in due time".[141]In 2013, Monáe said she wants both men and women to "still be attracted to [her]" and expressed support for theLGBTQ community.[151]
Monáe has said she identifies with bothbisexualityandpansexuality.[23]On January 10, 2020, shetweetedthehashtag#IAmNonbinary, along with a quoted tweet, which trended on Twitter that day.[152][153]Monáe said in an interview withThe Cuta month after the tweet that "I tweeted the #IAmNonbinary hashtag in support of Nonbinary Day and to bring more awareness to the community. I retweeted theSteven Universememe 'Are you a boy or a girl? I'm an experience' because it resonated with me, especially as someone who has pushed boundaries of gender since the beginning of my career. I feel my feminine energy, my masculine energy, and energy I can't even explain."[154]
In April 2022, shecame outpublicly asnon-binaryon theRed Table Talksaying, "I'm nonbinary, so I just don't see myself as a woman, solely... I feel like god is so much bigger than the 'he' or the 'she.' And if I am from God, I am everything."[155]In the interview, she also acknowledged having been in bothmonogamousandpolyamorousrelationships.[155]Following the interview, a representative of Monáe said that she "continues to use she/her pronouns."[156]In an interview with theLos Angeles Times, however, Monáe identified herself as non-binary and added that her "pronouns are free-ass motherfucker—and they/them, her/she."[157][158]

Abraham was born Murray Abraham on October 24, 1939;[1][2][3][4]inPittsburgh,Pennsylvania, the son of Fahrid "Fred" Abraham,[5]an automotive mechanic and his wife Josephine (née Stello; 1915–2012),[6][7]Murray has described himself as anItalian AmericanandSyrian American.[8][9]
His father emigrated with his family fromMuqlus,Ottoman Syria, a small village in theValley of the Christians, at age five;[10][11]his paternal grandfather was a priest in theGreek Orthodox Church of Antioch.[3][12][13]His mother, one of 14 children, wasItalian Americanand the daughter of an Italian immigrant who worked in the coal mines ofWestern Pennsylvania.[3]He had two younger brothers, Robert and Jack, who were killed in separate car accidents.[5]
Abraham was raised inEl Paso, Texas. Murray and his two younger brothers were altar boys in theSt. George Antiochian Orthodox Churchin El Paso.[12][13]He attended Vilas Grammar School, and graduated fromEl Paso High Schoolin 1958.[14]He was a gang member during his teenage years.[3]In El Paso, Abraham worked in theFarah Clothing[fr]factory owned by aLebanese Americanfamily[15]before launching a career in acting.[16]He attended Texas Western College (later namedUniversity of Texas at El Paso), where he was given the best actor award byAlpha Psi Omegafor his portrayal of theIndianNocona inComanche Eagleduring the 1959–60 season. He attended theUniversity of Texas at Austin, then studied acting underUta HagenatHB Studio[17]in New York City. He began his acting career on the stage, debuting in a Los Angeles production ofRay Bradbury'sThe Wonderful Ice Cream Suit.[citation needed]
Abraham added "F." to his stage name in honor of his father Fahrid.[18]He has stated that "Murray Abraham just doesn't seem to say anything. It just is another name, so I thought I'd frame it".[2]
Abraham made his screen debut as an usher in theGeorge C. ScottcomedyThey Might Be Giants(1971). He can be seen as one of the undercover police officers along withAl PacinoinSidney Lumet'sSerpico(1973) and in television roles including the bad guy in one fourth-season episode ofKojak("The Godson"). His early film roles include small parts as a cabdriver in the theatrical version ofNeil Simon'sThe Prisoner of Second Avenue(1975), a mechanic in the theatrical version of Simon'sThe Sunshine Boys(1975). He also played a police officer in theAlan J. PakulaWatergatefilmAll the President's Men(1976), and acted in the comedy filmsThe Ritz(1976) oppositeRita MorenoandThe Big Fix(1978) alongsideRichard Dreyfuss.
By the mid-1970s, he also had steady employment doing commercials and voice-overs. Most notably, he played "the leaf", one of four costumed characters, in television and print commercials forFruit of the Loomunderwear.[19]In 1978, he gave up this work. Frustrated with the lack of substantial roles, he said: "No one was taking my acting seriously. I figured if I didn't do it, then I'd have no right to the dreams I've always had." His wife, Kate Hannan, went to work as an assistant and Abraham became a "house husband". As he described it: "I cooked and cleaned and took care of the kids. It was very rough on my macho idea of life. But it was the best thing that ever happened to me."[19]
Abraham gained greater prominence when he appeared as drug dealer Omar Suárez in the gangster filmScarface(1983). Then, in 1984, he played envious composer Antonio Salieri in theAcademy Award for Best Picture-winningAmadeus(1984), directed byMiloš Forman. Abraham won theAcademy Award for Best Actorfor his role, an award for which his co-star in the filmTom Hulce, playingMozart, had also been nominated. He also won aGolden Globe Award, among other awards and his role in the film remains his most famous.
Abraham's relatively low-profile film career subsequent to hisAcademy Awardwin has been considered an example of the "Oscar jinx." According to film criticLeonard Maltin, professional failure following an early success is referred to in Hollywood circles as the "F. Murray Abraham syndrome."[20]Abraham rejected this notion and told Maltin, "The Oscar is the single most important event of my career. I have dined with kings, shared equal billing with my idols, lectured at Harvard and Columbia. If this is a jinx, I'll take two." In the same interview, Abraham said, "Even though I won the Oscar, I can still take the subway in New York, and nobody recognizes me. Some actors might find that disconcerting, but I find it refreshing."
Abraham also joinedThe Mirror Theater Ltd's Mirror Repertory Company in 1984. He joined MRC the week after winning his Oscar for Best Actor for his work inAmadeusbecause he wanted to work with MRC Artist-in-ResidenceGeraldine Page(to whom he would eventually present her ownAcademy Awardthe following year) and would star opposite her in MRC'sThe Madwoman of Chaillot.[21]

His next film role was inThe Name of the Rose(1986), in which he playedBernardo Gui, nemesis toSean Connery'sWilliam of Baskerville. In its DVD commentary, the director of the film,Jean-Jacques Annaud, described Abraham as an "egomaniac" on the set, who considered himself more important than Sean Connery because Connery did not have an Oscar.[22]Despite the on-set tensions, the film was a critical[23]and commercial success.
After the release ofThe Name of the Rose, Abraham tired of appearing as villains and wanted to return to his background in comedy.[24]From May 10 through July 14, 1991, Abraham  portrayed King Lear in American Repertory Theater's (A.R.T.) production ofKing Lear, directed by Adrian Hall, Cambridge, MA.[25]In 1994, Abraham portrayedRoy Cohnin the first Broadway production ofTony Kushner'sAngels in Americaat theWalter Kerr Theater, replacingRon Leibmanin the role.

He had a significant role inBrian De Palma's adaptation ofThe Bonfire of the Vanities(1990), but chose not to be credited due to a contract dispute.[3]He continued his association with classical music by narrating the plot summaries of the operas of Wagner'sRing Cyclein the 1990 PBS broadcast from theMetropolitan Opera, to the largest viewing audience of theRing Cyclein history, conducted byJames Levine.
