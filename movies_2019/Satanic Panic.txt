Satanic Panicis a 2019 Americancomedy horrorfilm directed byChelsea Stardust, based on a screenplay written by novelistGrady Hendrixand adapted from a story created by Hendrix andTed Geoghegan. It is aFangoriaproduction.[2][3]
In the film, avirgingirl working for apizza deliveryservice is captured by a cult. They want to use herwombto summonBaphomet, but would-be-rapistshave their own agenda about the girl.
The film had its world premiere at theOverlook Film Festivalon May 31, 2019.[1]It was released in the United States to limited theaters andVODplatforms on September 6, 2019, byRLJE Films.[4]It received mixed reviews from critics.
Samantha "Sam" Craft's first day as a pizza delivery girl is going poorly, as customers aren't giving her tips. When she is assigned a delivery in the affluentMill Basinneighborhood, she is hopeful that her luck will change. However, the delivery recipient, Gary Neumieir, also stiffs Sam on a tip. Frustrated and needing gas money, Sam enters the mansion to demand a tip. Inside, she inadvertently interrupts the secret gathering of a satanic coven led by Danica Ross. The coven, which includes Gary Neumieir and his wife Gypsy, capture Sam after they realize she is a virgin.
Sam awakens to find herself held captive with Danica's disgruntled husband, Samuel. Samuel explains that the coven plans to summon the demonBaphometbut needs a virgin's womb to do so. After Sam reveals that she is a virgin, Samuel says that he can save their lives by taking her virginity and tries to sexually assault her. Sam fights back. Samuel pulls a gun but accidentally fatally shoots himself as Sam escapes outside.
Sam flees down the street to another mansion, where her pleas for help are answered by a babysitter, Kristen. However, Sam soon discovers that the babysitter is in league with the coven. Fleeing upstairs, Sam encounters Kristen's sister Michelle, who attacks Sam with a strap-on dildo drill. Sam avoids the attack and Michelle accidentally impales her sister, before electrocuting herself when the drill punctures wiring in a wall.
Sam hears cries for help from a bedroom, and she enters to find Judi Ross, the daughter of coven leader Danica, hogtied on the bed. Danica had originally intended Judi to be the coven's virginal sacrifice, but after discovering that Judi had had sex to avoid this fate, Danica ordered Judi to be killed. Sam frees Judi and calls 911, but the call redirects to the coven, so the girls again flee.
Danica next tries to capture Sam by creating a "haxan cloak" creature from her dead husband's heart, but Sam escapes the creature with Judi's help. Gypsy questions Danica's leadership, and when the rest of the coven sides with Gypsy, Danica agrees to let Gypsy conduct a ritual to curse and kill Judi from afar. However, Judi, who is versed in witchcraft, manages with Sam's help to ward off the curse. An irate Gypsy confronts Danica about teaching her daughter the protection magic that allowed her to survive. Another coven member suddenly plunges a spike into Danica's head, apparently killing her. However, after the coven leaves in search of Sam, Danica resurrects herself. Using knowledge gained from reading the entrails of a man she murders, Danica tracks down and captures Sam and Judi.
Sam and Judi awaken tied to an altar in Danica's backyard, surrounded by the coven. Danica, triumphant and back in control of the coven, uses a spell to drown Gypsy. As she falls dead, Gypsy inadvertently breaks the protective circle of salt laid to prevent the ritual from being disturbed. The summoning begins, and Sam is supernaturally impregnated by Baphomet. An enraged Sam breaks free from her bonds and holds a knife to her now-pregnant belly, demanding Judi be released. Instead, Danica slashes Judi's throat and kills her.
Despondent, Sam suddenly goes into labor; to calm herself she repeats a "two fuzzy bunnies" mantra, and then she gives birth to two fuzzy bunnies (rather than Baphomet as intended) to the shock of the coven. Sam suddenly finds the yard empty of all coven members. A demon named Samaziel manifests in front of Sam in the guise of a little girl. Samaziel explains that it ranks higher than Baphomet among hell's demons and is angry that the coven did not worship it. Because the protective line of salt had been disturbed by Gypsy's death, Samaziel was able to enter and wreak havoc on the ritual. Sam convinces Samaziel to spare her, and as Sam flees, the yard is again populated with the coven. Danica is decapitated as Samaziel laughs. Coven members begin choking to death. Sam collects one of the bunnies (the other having been killed) and escapes on her Vespa as Samaziel waves goodbye.
Sam returns to the pizzeria, where she tells her boss she is going to Australia and leaves with her bunny, now named Judi Junior.

RLJ Entertainment(formerlyImage Entertainment) is an American film production company and home video distributor, distributing film and television productions in North America, with approximately 3,200 exclusiveDVDtitles and approximately 340 exclusiveCDtitles in domestic release, and approximately 450 programs internationally via sublicense agreements. For many of its titles, Image has exclusive audio and broadcast rights as well as digital download rights to approximately 2,100 video programs and over 400 audio programs containing more than 6,000 tracks. The company is headquartered inChatsworth, California.
Founded in 1981 as aNASDAQ-listed public company known as Image Entertainment, Image began as a distributor ofLaserDiscs, whose sound and picture quality surpassed that ofVHSandBeta, the dominant tape formats of the time. In its earlier years, the company originally distributed X-rated titles in addition to mainstream titles.[4]Image successfully secured exclusive output deals with major studios such asUniversal Studios,20th Century Fox,Orion Pictures, andThe Walt Disney Company, and grew to become the dominant distributor of the format. The company was trading under the symbol "DISK".
In August 1994, Image entered theCD-ROMmarket, releasing movies on the CD-ROM format.[5]
As the 1990s came to a close and Laserdiscs gave way to DVDs, Image re-focused on the fledgling format that quickly came to dominate the home video marketplace. While studios were busy managing the transition from VHS to DVD, Image began to acquire DVD rights to long-form music concert programs, television programming, foreign films and a broad array of special interest programming fromGRB Entertainment,20th Television/Foxstar Productions,Orion Pictures,Playboy Home EntertainmentandUniversal Pictures, all of which were being ignored by the major studios and music labels.[6]
In 2005, Image signed a distribution deal withBandai Visualto distribute selectanimetitles under the Honneamise label.[7]The deal ended in March 2007, when Bandai Visual switched over toGeneon USA.[8]
Image continued to work with its long-term partner,Criterion Collection, as well as hundreds of independent content producers and rights holders to bring products to the marketplace. By the 10th anniversary of the DVD, Image has once again established itself as a dominant distributor of independently produced programs. In 2008, Image began to expand its release schedule to include feature films.
On August 31, 2010,Sony Pictures Home Entertainmentpartnered with Image Entertainment in a multi-year agreement, marketing and distributing some DVDs and Blu-rays by Image. Image retains its own sales and marketing.[9]The deal was expired in April 2012, when Mill Creek Entertainment agreed to release the most ofSony Pictureslibraries. On April 27, 2011, Image Entertainment made a long-term agreement withLakeshore Entertainmentto distribute their film library on home media. This also gave them access to theNew World Pictureslibrary which Lakeshore acquired in 1996, with many of the titles not issued on Blu-ray at the time.[10]Incidentally, Image originally released a number of New World titles on laserdisc from the late 80's to early 90's. 
On April 2, 2012, it was announced that RLJ Acquisition, Inc. had entered into an agreement to acquire Image Entertainment as well as Acorn Media and plan to merge the two companies. The two companies operate under the banner "RLJ Entertainment".[11]The company was then renamed RLJ Entertainment.[12]In 2014, RLJ acquired British media distributor Acorn Media UK, this deal also included 64% inAgatha Christie Limited.[13]
On July 30, 2018,AMC Networksreached a definitive agreement to acquire RLJ Entertainment where AMC would pay $59 million for the remaining RLJE shares not owned by AMC orRobert L. Johnson.[14]The transaction was approved by RLJ Entertainment's stockholders on October 31, and AMC Networks completed the acquisition on November 1.[15]RLJ Entertainment became a privately owned subsidiary of AMC Networks, with Johnson and his affiliates owning a 17% stake.

Fangoriais an internationally distributed Americanhorror filmfan magazine, in publication since 1979. It is published four times a year by Fangoria Publishing, LLC and is edited byPhil Nobile Jr.
The magazine was originally released in an age when horror fandom was still a burgeoningsubculture; in the late 1970s, most horror publications were concerned with classic cinema, while those that focused on contemporary horror were largelyfanzines.Fangoriarose to prominence by running exclusive interviews with horror filmmakers and offering behind-the-scenes photos and stories that were otherwise unavailable to fans in the era before the Internet. The magazine would eventually rise to become a force itself in the horror world, hosting its ownawards show, sponsoring and hosting numerous horror conventions,producing films, and printing its own line ofcomics.
Fangoriabegan struggling in the 2010s due to issues arising from the internet, including difficulty in generating enough ad revenue to cover printing costs.[2]Publication became sporadic beginning in fall 2015, and the magazine ran through a succession of editors in 2015–2016, culminating with the February 2017 announcement of Ken Hanley's December 2016 departure. After this, the magazine ceased publication. The magazine remained dormant throughout 2017.
In February 2018, Dallas-based entertainment companyCinestateboughtFangoriaand, under new editor-in-chief Phil Nobile Jr., relaunched the magazine as a print-based quarterly publication.[3]In October 2018, Cinestate released the first newFangoriamagazine under their ownership, stylized as "Volume 2, Issue 1."
In August 2020, Tara Ansley and Abhi Goel acquiredFangoriafrom Cinestate under Fangoria Publishing, LLC, and, as of issue 9, are the publishers of the magazine and owners of the brand.[4]
Kerry O'Quinnand Norman Jacobs first conceived ofFangoriain 1978 by under the nameFantasticaas a companion to their science fiction media magazineStarlog. Just asStarlogcoveredscience fiction filmsfor a primarily teenaged audience,Fantasticawas intended to coverfantasy filmsfor a similar audience. O'Quinn, who had previously publishedsoap operafan magazines, anticipated a groundswell of interest in the fantasy genre due to Hollywood's plan to bringRobert E. Howard'sConan the Barbarianto the screen, although that movie would not appear for another four years.[5]
The first issue was assembled under the editorship of "Joe Bonham", a pseudonym taken from the quadriplegic hero of Dalton Trumbo's pacifist novelJohnny Got His Gun. This was a cover forRolling Stonecontributor and screenwriterEd Nahaand writerRic Meyers.[citation needed]Shortly after the publishing trade press announced the coming launch ofFantastica, the launch was delayed by several months when the publishers of aStarlogcompetitor,Fantastic Filmsmagazine, threatened a lawsuit because of the similarity in titles.[6]This was eventually decided in favor of the plaintiff in court.[7]
Brainstorming sessions resulted in the nameFangoria, over the objections ofRobert "Bob" Martin, who was hired as editor during the delay.[7]The first issue went to print July 31, 1979, with an August cover date.
The first issue ofFangoriawas designed around the original "fantasy film" concept for the magazine and proved to be a notable publishing failure, as were the next five issues, all of which continued with the same approach. By the time issue four was released and issue six was in preparation, the publisher confided to Martin that the magazine was losing approximately US$20,000 per issue, an amount the small publisher could not sustain for long.[citation needed]
As described in one history of horror magazines, "The first issue ofFangoria, published in 1979, was an abysmal failure, and subsequent issues did not fare much better. Apparently there was little or no interest in another magazine that did not deviate much from the already establishedStarlog/Cinefantastiquestructure."[5]But because of great reader interest in "a lavishly illustrated article onTom Savini's gruesome make-up effects for the 1978 filmDawn of the Dead," the magazine began focusing on "readers' macabre interest in gory images of monsters and carnage."[5]With the seventh issue, "with a bold shift to fright flicks by featuring a still fromStanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningon the cover", the magazine had become profitable.[8]Then "the 1980s gave rise to an endless offering of goryslasher filmsthatFangoriawas more than happy to highlight, turningFreddy Krueger,Leatherface,Michael MyersandJason Voorheesinto unlikely lucrative newsstand idols."[8]
Martin continued as editor into the mid-1980s,[citation needed]with co-editor David Everitt from 1981 to 1985.[9]After Everitt left, he was replaced byStarlogeditor David McDonnell, who handled both magazines, withTony Timponeunder him asmanaging editoronFangoria.[10]In 1986, Timpone became editor-in-chief:
I first joined theFangoriastaff in July of 1985. It was my first job out of college, although I had been freelancing toFango's sister publicationStarlogduring my last year at college. I began as an Editorial Assistant to then-Editor David Everitt, who decided to move on a month after I started. Since I was fresh out of college and this was my first job in publishing, I was a little too green to take over the job myself. So I served as the Managing Editor to Dave McDonnell, who took over as Editor until I got my wings. The following year, I was promoted to Editor in Chief.[10]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s,Fangoriatested numerous international horror markets, releasing issues of the magazine modified for various foreign languages. These foreign editions (released in Italy, Japan, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere) lasted only a handful of editions before being discontinued. Additionally, in May 1988, a sister publication titledGorezonewas first published. A second sister publication, titledToxic Horrorfollowed in 1989.Gorezonewas cancelled after twenty-seven issues and one specialTales from the Crypt-themed issue.Toxic Horrorwas cancelled after five issues.
In 1990, Timpone brought in managing editorMichael Gingold, having been previously introduced to his horror-themedfanzine,Scareaphenalia.[11]In addition to his editorial duties at the magazine, Gingold posted the majority of the news updates on the magazine's official website.[12]Under Gingold and Timpone's tenure, Fangoria rose to its greatest level of prominence, enjoying widespread recognition and influence in the horror community.
Creative Group purchasedFangoria(and its parent publicationStarlog) in the early 2000s, hoping to expand the brand identity of the magazine to radio, television, and comics. On December 5, 2007, a warehouse operated by Kable News, inOregon, Illinois, which contained all back issues ofFangoriaandStarlogmagazines, was destroyed by fire. As back issues ofFangoriaare not re-printed, the only remaining back issues are now housed in private collections or those available on the secondary market.[13]After several failed ventures, Creative Group filed for Chapter 11 on March 21, 2008.[14]In summer 2008, The Brooklyn Company, Inc., led by longtime Fangoria president Thomas DeFeo, boughtFangoriaand all its related brands.[15]Under DeFeo's ownership, the magazine overhauled the magazine's cover format, including the transformation of the company's long-standing logo. Starting with issue #281, the originalFangorialogo was re-designed, and the trademark "film strip", tagline, and embedded photos were removed. After consistent fan protest of the changes, the original logo returned with issue #305. The "film strip" photos returned briefly beginning with issue #309.
In February 2010,Chris Alexander, aToronto-based filmmaker and former writer forRue Morgue, succeededTony TimponeasFangoria's new editor.[16]Under his management, the magazine explored more esoteric genre content, had its cover layout altered a few times, and hired several new staff members. Alexander also brought back the original Fangoria logo. In 2011,Gorezonewas revived with a specialThe Bloody Best of Gorezoneissue before resuming regular publication with issue #28 in 2013. In 2012,Fangoriaalso began publishing a line of limited edition specials titledFangoria Legends.
In late September 2015, Alexander stepped down as editor-in-chief and left theFangoriastaff. By October, Gingold, who was then serving as managing editor, was hired as the publication's new editor-in-chief.[17]Eight months later, Gingold was fired after twenty-eight years with the magazine and the former managing editor, Ken Hanley, was named the new editor-in-chief.[18]Many within the horror community responded with shock at Gingold's termination and took it as a sign that the magazine had both lost touch with its fanbase and passed its glory days;Guillermo del Torotook to social media to voice his disappointment with the decision.[19]
On February 11, 2017, Hanley announced that he too was no longer involved with the magazine and that he had been on hiatus from the company since mid-December 2016. He also stated that he felt that if the magazine remained under its current ownership, there would likely never be another new issue, especially as a print edition.[20]
The last print edition of the magazine, issue #344, was released October 2015. After that issue, four additional issues were published exclusively in a digital format, leaving subscribers of the hard copy editions, as well as Gorezone subscribers, without the issues they paid for. Additionally, contributors such as Josh Hadley have stated that they remain unpaid for published articles and artwork.[21]Fangoria responded to the statements made by Hanley and Hadley on February 13, in which president and owner Tom DeFeo thanked readers and subscribers for their patience and noted his intention to make amends with writers, artists, and subscribers that had been inconvenienced. The statement also noted that lack of sufficient ad revenue had been the reason for the disappearance of print editions but that DeFeo and his staff would continue their attempts to bring print editions back.[22]
In February 2018, it was announced that Fangoria had been purchased by film producerDallas Sonnierthrough his Texas-based entertainment companyCinestate. Sonnier named Phil Nobile Jr., of theBirth.Movies.Death.website as its new editor-in-chief. The company further announced that they would bring back the magazine as a quarterly, exclusively print-based publication, and offer a one-year free subscription to anyone who never received the issues to which they were entitled under the old ownership.
In addition to Gingold and Timpone returning as regular columnists, Cinestate further announced that the new writing staff would be composed ofS. Craig Zahler,Grady Hendrix,Shuddercurator Sam Zimmerman, Birth.Movies.Death's Meredith Borders, author and formerRue Morguemagazine writerPreston Fassel, horror historianRebekah McKendry, andblack feministcritic Ashlee Blackwell.[3]Cinestate planned on branching the franchise into producing films, podcasts and novels.[23]
On May 19, 2018, the magazine announced its first licensed novel,Preston Fassel'sOur Lady of the Inferno, under their newFangoria Presentslabel.[24]The book was released September 11, 2018, to generally positive reviews, ultimately being named one of the ten best horror novels of 2018 byBloody Disgusting.[25]A week later, on September 18, Fangoria released their second licensed novel, Michael J. Seidlinger'sMy Pet Serial Killer.
In October 2018, Cinestate published their first issue of the magazine, stylized as "Volume 2, Issue 1," featuring a cover story on the 2018 filmHalloween.[26]
In June 2020,The Daily Beastpublished an exposé about producer Adam Donaghey'ssexual misconducton the set of a Cinestate film.[27]
In August 2020, Fangoria was acquired by Wanderwall Entertainment CEO Tara Ansley and entrepreneur Abhi Goel, and quarterly printing continued under their ownership. The new owners plan to launch a multimedia studio and produce and distribute fiction and non-fiction content.[4][28]
Starting in 1985, Fangoria branched out into other media outlets including television, films, radio, and comic books.
Beginning in 1985,Fangoriahas sponsored annual horror movie conventions known as theWeekend of Horrorsin Los Angeles, New Jersey, and Chicago (with Austin, Texas, added in 2008).[29]These conventions were produced in association withCreation Entertainment. After breaking ties with Creation in 2009, Fangoria began their own conventions, titling them the "Trinity of Terrors".
In 1990,Fangoria Filmswas created with the goal of financing one feature film a year under this banner. The first film was 1990'sMindwarp, starringBruce Campbell. They createdChildren of the Nightin 1991 andSevered Tiesin 1992, then ceased production.[30]In 1996, Fangoria Films re-emerged as a distribution company, occasionally using their "Gore Zone" label, to release twenty low-budget horror features over the next ten years. In 2004–2005, Fangoria Films produced and distributedFangoria's Blood Drive, two DVD compilations of award-winning short horror films. The first volume was hosted by musician-turned-filmmakerRob Zombie, and the second by MuchMusic's (now calledFUSE)Mistress Juliya.
In 1991,Fangoriabegan honoring horror cinema with their annual Chainsaw Awards, which were voted on by readers of their magazine. The winners were announced at an awards show inLos Angeles,California, which was produced by Fangoria's managing editor, Michael Gingold. In association withFUSE TV,Fangoriafirst televised its Chainsaw Awards in 2006. The event occurred on October 15, and was aired on FUSE on October 22. The event was not renewed for 2007, although the awards continued in the magazine.[31]
From 1999 to 2003, they partnered with Bedford Entertainment to attain wider releases of certainFangoriatitles.[32]Movies released during this time includedI, Zombie: A Chronicle of Pain,The Last Horror Movie,Slashers, andDead Meat.[33]Many of these films featured theFangorialogo along the top of their video/DVD covers, whileFangoria's involvement in other releases was substantially more subdued.
From 2006 to 2009, Fangoria worked with Creative Group after it had purchased Fangoria in the early 2000s.Fangoria Entertainmentwas created as a result. This allowed both parties to agitate theFangoriabrand identity to a number of other media outlets in 2006. Creative Group also added a new "Vampire Skull" logo to Fangoria's properties, which was used extensively after its inception. In 2010, all of Creative Group's Fangoria brands were discontinued.
From 2006 to 2007 there wasFangoria TV. Originally conceived as a network television station dedicated to horror films, it was eventually modified to fit a limited online format.
From 2006 to 2009 there wasFangoria Radio. Debuting on Friday, June 23, 2006, it was a horror-themed talk radio program which aired onSirius RadioChannel 108 andXM RadioChannel 139 on Friday nights. It was hosted byDee SniderandDebbie Rochon, and regularly featured then-editorTony Timpone.
In June 2007,Fangoria Comicswas launched. For various reasons, the line abruptly ended a month later in August.[34]Only two series were published: the two-issue seriesFourth Horsemen,[35]and the four-issue seriesBump.[36]
In 2018, underCinestate, Fangoria's podcast network included the showsShockwaves,Nightmare on Film Street,Post Mortem withMick Garris,Casualty Friday,The Movie Crypt, andNightmare University. Concurrently, Fangoria founded aliterary imprintcalled FANGORIA Presents that published four novels between 2018-2020, including works byMick GarrisandMax Booth III; two additionalexperimentalhorror novels, Robert Ashcroft'sThe Megarothkeand Jess Hagemann'sHeadcheesewere published under a sister imprint but promoted through Fangoria. The podcast network disbanded and the imprints were shut down following the 2020 controversy.[37][38][39]In 2022,Mark Alan Milleracquired the publishing rights to five of the six books to be reprinted in new editions through his company Encyclopocalypse Publications.[40]
In 2011Fangoriapartnered with producer Carl Amari to createFangoria's Dreadtime Stories, a horror radio drama series hosted byMalcolm McDowelland featuring original music byFangoriaeditor-in-chief Chris Alexander.
In late 2020,Fangoriadebuted the showsColors of the DarkandThe KingCaston their podcast network.[citation needed]
At one point, said longtime editor Tony Timpone,Fangoria"almost did a 'Fango Junior', for the young adult/Goosebumpsset."[41]
Until 2016, theFangoriaonline site featured daily updates about the world of horror, allowing theFangoriabrand to remain relevant to those who do not typically read print magazines. The website also featured several specialized horror blogs, including articles that continuedFangoria's long tradition of being supportive ofLGBTpeople working in the horror industry.
Following Cinestate's acquisition ofFangoria, the homepage briefly went offline, replaced eventually by a front page of aggregated news. This version of the site was discontinued once Cinestate sold the brand to Fangoria Publishing, LLC. Fangoria.com returned in 2021.
The Fangoria Chainsaw Awards are an award ceremony forhorror filmsandthriller films.  Beginning in 1992, the awards were expanded and an annual ceremony was inaugurated to give out the awards.[42]
