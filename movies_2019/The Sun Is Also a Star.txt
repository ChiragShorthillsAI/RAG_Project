Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]
Warner Bros. owns some shared universes. Some of them are based on books and comics, including some of the highest grossing IP's in the movie industry.
