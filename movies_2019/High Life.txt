High Lifeis a 2018science fictionhorrorfilm directed byClaire Denis, in English, written by Denis and her long-time collaboratorJean-Pol Fargeau. StarringRobert PattinsonandJuliette Binoche, it focuses on a group of criminals sent on a space mission toward ablack holewhile taking part in scientific experiments.
Physicist and black hole expertAurélien Barrauwas hired as a consultant, and Danish-Icelandic artistOlafur Eliassondesigned the film's spacecraft.[3]High Lifepremiered on 9 September 2018 at theToronto International Film Festival.[5][6]
A group of criminals serving death sentences are sent on a mission in space toextract alternative energy from a black hole. Each prisoner is treated as a guinea pig by Dibs, a scientist, for her experiments; Dibs is fixated on trying to create a child in space throughartificial insemination, but has yet to succeed. Sexual activity between prisoners is prohibited.
The ship is equipped with "The Box", a device in a small room that is obsessively used by the crew tomasturbate, while Dibs administers sedatives to the passengers. Monte, the onlycelibateprisoner, rejects Dibs' sexual advances. He is serving a life sentence formanslaughteras a child. Monte's only friend on the ship is Tcherny, who is drawn to the onboard garden because it reminds him of life back on Earth.
Pregnant prisoner Elektra delivers a baby, who dies later before she does as well. The captain, Chandra, developsleukemiafrom radiation and has a stroke before beingeuthanizedby Dibs. One night, male prisoner Ettore attempts torapeBoyse. Nansen, the pilot, intervenes, but Ettore attacks and overpowers her. Monte arrives, throws Ettore off Boyse, and beats him. When Monte leads Boyse away to be treated, Mink stabs Ettore to death in the hallway. Dibs begins doubling the amount of sedatives each prisoner receives, later sneaking into Monte's cell andraping himwhile he is sedated. She theninjectshissemeninto Boyse, who produces a healthy child that Dibs dotes on, but Monte is unaware that he is the baby's father.
As the ship approaches the black hole, Nansen prepares to pilot a shuttle around it. Unbeknownst to the other prisoners, Boyse kills Nansen with a shovel and takes her place. The shuttle travels through a molecular cloud that alters its trajectory and causes it to dive into the black hole, where Boyse dies gruesomely due tospaghettification. Mink later attacks Dibs and injures her, but is then killed by Monte. Dibs informs him that the child is his before ejecting herself into space. Tcherny commits suicide and Monte buries his body in the garden according to his wishes. Now the only survivor, Monte removes the bodies from the ship's morgue, dresses them in spacesuits, and releases them into the vacuum of space.
Monte struggles to raise the child, whom he has named Willow. He attempts to make repairs to the ship, but her frantic cries through his helmet speakers cause him to drop a tool and lose it in space. Much later, when Willow has grown into a teenager, they encounter another ship similar to their own. Monte boards the ship, but finds it carrying stray dogs who have survived by eating one another. Willow begs Monte to bring one back, but he refuses, implying contamination could potentially sicken or kill them. The ship moves closer to the black hole, and Willow convinces Monte to board a shuttle with her and execute thePenrose processthat, if successful, is supposed to slingshot them away from the black hole. No longer wearing space suits, Monte takes Willow's hand, and they walk together to a yellow light source that grows ever larger and envelops them.
Claire Denishad the idea of the project in her mind for fifteen years.[7]She said, "I had a screenplay which was naturally in English, because the story takes place in space and, I don't know why, but for me, people speak English—or Russian or Chinese—but definitely not French in space."[8]
NovelistNick Lairdco-wrote the screenplay for the film along with Denis, Fargeau and Geoff Cox. Laird's wifeZadie Smithalso contributed to early drafts of the English version of the screenplay.[9]Due to creative differences between Denis and Smith, Laird and Smith dropped out of the project as screenwriters, but Laird later served as the consultant for the script.[10]
Denis went to theEuropean Space Agency's Astronaut Centre in Cologne to learn about human spaceflight exploration before the film started shooting.[11]
Denis explained the practical reasons for the non-linear story, saying "I always wanted it to start with a man and a baby, as a ritual of two living persons with no despair in that moment. And then there would be the flashbacks bringing in all the despair."[12]Denis compared Pattinson's character to the knightPercivalof Arthurian legend, and Binoche's character toMedeafrom the Greek tragedy.[12]
During the project's early stages, Denis hadVincent Galloin mind for the lead role,[7]and wrote the film thinking ofPhilip Seymour Hoffman. The project later caught the attention ofRobert Pattinson; according to Denis:
Pattinson contacted the person who was doing the English casting. I was intrigued but I thought he was too young. Every time I went to London to meet some actors, he was there. His desire to work with me has never faltered. And now he is a little less young and it's perfect. […] It's strange, though, because it would be difficult to imagine anyone more unlike Philip Seymour Hoffman physically, but Robert is very enigmatic, with a powerful presence. He gives off an aura that immediately makes you want to film him.[8]
Pattinson described his character as an astronaut and said, "He's a criminal who volunteers for a mission toward a black hole, but he realizes along the way that a doctor on board also wants to do sexual experimentation with humans in space."[13]In late 2015,Patricia ArquetteandMia Gothjoined the cast.[14]In September 2017, Arquette dropped out while the rest of the cast, includingJuliette Binocheand rapperAndré 3000, were also announced.[15]Playing the role of baby Willow is Scarlett Lindsey, Pattinson's goddaughter. After Pattinson was unable to bond with the babies cast as Willow, he remembered that Lindsey was friendly around adults. Pattinson asked a favour of Lindsey's father to cast her in the film, which he described as a "massive gamble" that was ultimately paid off by her "incredible" performance.[16]
Principal photography began inCologne, Germany on 4 September 2017.[13][17][18][15][failed verification]The Polish part of the shooting took place inBiałystok.[19]Filmingwrappedin late October 2017.[20]
Following its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, the film competed in main competition at theSan Sebastián International Film Festivalin late September 2018.[21]The film had its theatrical release in France on 7 November 2018[22]and in the United Kingdom on 10 May 2019.[23][24]A24acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film.[25]The film was released in the United States on 5 April 2019.[26]It was later given a Blu-Ray/DVD release in North American retailers.
On review aggregation websiteRotten Tomatoes, 82% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 236 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "High Lifeis as visually arresting as it is challenging, confounding, and ultimately rewarding – which is to say it's everything film fans expect from director Claire Denis."[27]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted averagescore of 78 out of 100 based on reviews from 42 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[28]
David Ehrlich ofIndieWiregave the film an A− grade, saying it owed more toSolaristhanStar Warsand describing it as "a pensive and profound study of human life on the brink of the apocalypse."[29]Jessica Kiang ofVarietycalled it "extraordinary, difficult, hypnotic, and repulsive".[30]Charles Bramesco of theGuardiangave the film 5 stars out of 5, saying Denis had reconfigured the genre's "familiar components to create a startlingly fresh engagement with the question of what it means to be human."[31]Steve MacFarlane ofSlant Magazinewrote: "The film asks down-and-dirty questions about what really resides beneath thousands of years of human progress, a savage and haunting antidote to the high-minded idealism of movies likeChristopher Nolan'sInterstellarandRidley Scott'sThe Martian."[32]Matt Zoller Seitz ofRogerEbert.comdescribed it as "tailor-made for viewers who like science fiction in a cryptic 1970s art-house mode."[33]
In France,Le MondeandLibérationdescribedHigh Lifeas a "masterpiece".[34][35]

Guests on the podcast have includedBo Burnham,Sofia Coppola,Paul Schrader,Martin Scorsese, andAlia Shawkat. Despite lacking any pre-defined structure, episodes generally contain discussions around recent works of the two guests, allowing for branching discussions to other areas. The first two guests wereBarry Jenkins(director of A24'sMoonlight) andGreta Gerwig(director of A24'sLady Bird), who both discussed what it's like to make a movie about the place they grew up.[39]As of October 18, 2023, 38 episodes have been released.[40][41][42]

It is currently unknown if this slate of films will have a theatrical release or be exclusive to Apple's streaming service,Apple TV+.[44]

During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, A24 was approved to continue filming and promotional activities since they do not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP).[57]
In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

Canal+(French:[kanalplys], meaning "Channel Plus"), also speltCanal Plusand sometimes abbreviatedC+orCanal, is a French premium television channel owned byCanal+. The channel was launched in November 1984, and broadcasts toMetropolitan France. It broadcasts several kinds of programming, mostlyencrypted, but some unencrypted content can be viewed free of charge.
Canal+ was co-founded byAndré RousseletandPierre Lescure. An early pioneer wasAlain de Greef[fr], who joined in 1986.
In 1978, six years before Canal's launch, Jean Frydman who had the TVCS (Télévision Communication Services) project was planning a project to launch a fourth television channel in France which had its roots from the previousCanal 10project. Whilst waiting for abling to create an encrypted TV channel, the TVCS project had first planned to produce and broadcast their own programmes during time slots when three French television channels began broadcasting atest cardin the night and in the morning.[1]One year later in July 1979, it was announced that the channel had chosen to broadcast the programmes produced by public national television channel and the TVCS companyAntenne 2(now known as France 2) who had broadcast encrypted programmes that were originally intended for businesses or certain professionals.[2]
In March 1984 eight before the official launch, Canal+ started their retransmission tests in the Île-de-France region. Those first broadcasts were scheduled every day from 2 to 6pm and they were consisted of music videos, animated short films and various movie trailers.
Canal+ was launched in November 1984, when there were only three government-owned channels available in France.[3]The company was co-founded byAndré Rousselet, president of the French multinational advertising companyHavas,[3]andPierre Lescure(bornc.1945), who proved very popular with media professionals and politicians.[4]It got off to a slow start, and some politicians, including prime ministerLaurent Fabius, railed against the idea of having a commercial TV channel. However, Rousselet was a personal friend of the president,François Mitterrand, and so obtained favourable terms for the setup.Pierre Lescurewas director-general at that time. A combination of political connections and clever programming – giving the French public American hit comedies and French drama not available on the government channels – worked and subscriptions soon increased. Government regulations required that the channel give several hours of free programming each day, which was used by Canal+ to promote the subscription service.[3]Its first logo was used from inception until 1995.[citation needed]
The channel initially had to use 45% of its air-time on films, until the film industry pushed back. Sport, interview shows, documentaries, andsoft pornographyjoined films as the main staples of programming at this time.[3]Starting in 1985, Canal+ has had a tradition of showing onepornographic filmevery month  at midnight, generally on the first Saturday of the month.[5]In 1985, the government opened up the market to other private commercial television stations, offering some serious competition. However, aggressive marketing and policies ensured that the company kept growing.[3]
Alain de Greef[fr](c.1947– 29 June 2015) joined in 1986[6]joining his longtime friend Pierre Lescure. De Greef was first appointed director of production, then head of programmes, and finally as director general (1986–2000).[7]De Greef was later described as a pioneer and visionary, who set the tone and created the "Canal Plus spirit", which embodied anti-conformism along with edgy satire that became very popular. He created the satirical puppet showLes Guignols de l'Infoand cult talk showsNulle part ailleurs,[6]Groland, andLes Deschiens.[citation needed]
In 1987, Canal+ wentpublic. By 1989, Canal+ had almost three million subscribers. The company expanded into some European markets, notably Belgium, Spain, and Germany, and started setting up subsidiaries as it developed intoGroupe Canal+.[3]
In 1994, Rousselet quit the board, and was replaced by director-general Lescure.[3]
Digital satellite providerCanalSatellitewas launched as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canal+ on 6 December 1991. On 27 April 1996, Canal+ received two new sister channels: Canal+ Jaune and Canal+ Bleu.[8]A fourth channel, called Canal+ Vert, came along on 31 August 1998. The channels changed their names to Canal+ Confort (now known as Canal+ Décalé since 2005), Canal+ Cinéma, and Canal+ Sport on 1 November 2003.
In January 2000, theLagardère Grouppurchased a major stake in the digital television division.[9][10]In December 2000,Vivendiacquired Canal+.[11]In 2001, co-founder Alain De Greef was fired from his position as director-general and replaced byMichel Denisot, when the organisation wasrestructuredunder the leadership ofJean-Marie Messier, chief executive of Vivendi.[7]Criticism of Vivendi's poor share performance since the takeover grew, and in April 2002, De Greef's co-founder and CEO Pierre Lescure, clashed with Messier and was fired.[4]
An alternative logo was used between 2006 and 2009.
In September 2005, Canal+, Canal+ Cinéma and Canal+ Sport started broadcasting in the Frenchdigital terrestrial televisionnetwork. Thefree-to-airparts of Canal+ had already been broadcasting for a few months by then. In August 2008, Canal+ started broadcasting theencryptedparts of its main channel in high-definition in the terrestrial network. Canal+ announced plans to turn off theanalogue terrestrialsignals by 2010.[12]
In April 2014,Ligue 1, France's topassociation footballleague, sold broadcast rights for 2016–2020 to Canal+ for 726 millioneuros.[13]
In July 2024, reports emerged that Vivendi was exploring a potential London Stock Exchange listing for Canal+.[14]In December 2024, Canal+ Group was spun-out as independent company.[15]The channel will leave the terrestrial platform in France in June 2025, alongside Canal+ Cinéma, Canal+ Sport and Planète+, as a result of the cut in its agreement with Arcom to keep its licences afloats as a response to the non-renewal of its free-to-air channelC8by theArcom. Only 70,000 subscribers receive Canal+ in terrestrial.[16]From 6 June 2025,France 4will take over its slot; from that day, the new digital terrestrial channel plan will be introduced.[17]
Canal+ broadcasts toMetropolitan France. Its programming is mostlyencrypted, but some unencrypted programming can be viewed free of charge. The channel does not broadcast advertising, except when broadcasting onfree-to-airslots. Almost all foreign films and series can be viewed either in their original language with French subtitles (on a secondary audio channel) or dubbed in French. All programs are subtitled in French for deaf people and those who struggle with hearing. Some programs also have audio description for those who are visually impaired.[citation needed]
Canal+ is a supporter of theHybrid Broadcast Broadband TV(HbbTV) initiative, which promotes and establishes an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface.[citation needed]
Originally, subscribers would be mailed a code to punch in on their decoder's control panel to view the encrypted service (using theRITC Discret 1system); the code would be based upon the decoder's serial number (stored in the box's ROM). To avoid problems with customer's codes being not delivered on time by the postal system, Canal+ would switch to encryption based on a generic key, between the last day of the month (beginning at midnight) and the first Monday of the next month (until 9 AM). During this time, all decoders—even those with lapsed subscriptions—would be able to view the channel.[18]
However, signal piracy was rampant, especially after the magazineRadio Plansprinted decoder plans in their December 1984 issue. As a result of this, Canal+ switched to the much strongerNagravisionencryption system beginning in 1992; the Discret system was fully phased out by 1995. The new decoders utilised smart cards, cut into the shape of a key and inserted into the front of the decoder. Different decoders using theD2-MACstandard were also deployed during this time, mostly for cable subscribers. With the launch of CanalSatellite, theMediaguardencryption system was instituted, created bySECA(Société Européenne de Contrôle d'Accès), a firm owned by Canal+ andBertelsmann; Canal+ eventually bought out Bertelsmann's stake and rebranded SECA as Canal+ Technologies. This firm was sold by 2003 toThomson SA. The MediaGuard system's use in Britain (by the now defunctOnDigital/ITV Digital) led to hackers in the employ ofRupert Murdoch's rival encryption company NDS breaking into the MediaGuard system, resulting in new cards being issued to Canal+ subscribers in 2002 and Canal+ starting legal action against Murdoch. The Nagravision system continued in use until 30 November 2011, when all analog television broadcasting in France ceased.[19][20][21]
Les Chaînes Canal+is the offer name regrouping the premium Canal+-branded channels in France.[22]From 2003 to 2008 it was calledCanal+ Le Bouquet.[citation needed]

Ciné+ OCSis a group of French thematicpay televisionnetworksoperated byCanal+ Thématiques, and distributed byCanal+onsatellite TV,cable, andIPTV.
Launched in 1991, the channels were originally only dedicated to films, with the exception of Ciné+ Frisson which broadcast two television series from 2012 to 2017. Since 3 July 2024, following a merge withOCS, it is now also dedicated to television series.[1][2]
The channels broadcast all foreign films and series in their original language on a secondary audio channel with two subtitling tracks in French, one for translation from a foreign language and the other for the hearing impaired.
In Belgium, Ciné+ became Ciné+ OCS later on 1 October 2024, where it only operates the 3 channels OCS, Ciné+ Frisson and Ciné+ Classic as part of theBeTVbouquet.[3][4]
Ciné+ subscribers were given access toCiné+ à la demande, a content hub within the platforms (such as MyCanal), to stream their programs.
In Belgium, Ciné+ OCS à la demande is part ofBeTVwith Be à la demande.[5]
In 2018, Ciné+ started to launch thematic digital channel on Ciné+ à la demande. Some channels where available for a limited time, while other where available for multiples years :
Following the merge with OCS, the content hub was simply renamedCiné+ OCS, and is still available within MyCanal. It was also made available as a subscription-based channel on others services likeAmazon Prime Video. All OCS subscribers were automatically transferred to a Ciné+ OCS subscription. Some of the digital channels were simply transformed into categories on the Ciné+ OCS's hub.
Some series from this list were only made available on streaming.

Linked page for 'Claire Denis' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Denis):
Claire Denis(/dəˈniː/;French:[dəni]; born 21 April 1946) is a French film director and screenwriter. Her feature filmBeau Travail(1999) has been called one of the greatest films of the 1990s and of all time.[1][2][3]Her work has dealt with themes of colonial and post-colonialWest Africa, as well as issues in modern France, and continues to influence European cinematic identity.[4][5][6]
Other acclaimed works includeTrouble Every Day(2001),35 Shots of Rum(2008),White Material(2009),High Life(2018) andBoth Sides of the Blade(2022), the last of which won her theSilver Bear for Best Directorat the72nd Berlin International Film Festival.[7]ForStars at Noon(2022), Denis won theGrand Prixat the2022 Cannes Film Festival, sharing the award withLukas Dhont'sClose.[8]
Denis was born on 21 April 1946[9]in Paris,[10][11]but raised in colonial French Africa, where her father was a civil servant, living inBurkina Faso,Cameroon,French Somaliland, andSenegal.[12]Her childhood was spent living in West Africa with her parents and her younger sister coloured her perspective on certain political issues. Their father told them that independence from France would be a good thing for these colonies.[13]Her upbringing was a strong influence on her films, which have dealt with colonialism and post-colonialism in Africa.[14]Her father moved with the family every two years because he wanted the children to learn about geography.
Growing up in West Africa, Denis used to watch old and damaged copies of war films sent from the United States. As an adolescent, she loved to read. Completing the required material while in school, at night she would sneak her mother's detective stories to read.[15]At age 12, Denis was diagnosed withpolioand returned to France for treatment. She lived inSceaux, a suburb of Paris, for the rest of her teenage years.[16]During her time in France, she felt unfit for living in France. She was educated for a life in Africa, and felt completely different from everyone around her.[17]
In 1969, Denis married a photographer she met at the age of 15, after being hired as his assistant. Due to the complex nature of having him in her private life but also as her teacher, they divorced soon after.[18]
Denis initially studied economics, but, she has said, "It was completely suicidal. Everything pissed me off."[15]She then briefly studied Oriental languages and married a photographer who encouraged her to quit. In 1969 Denis studied atIDHEC(L'Institut des hautes études cinématographiques – now La Fémis) with her husband's encouragement. He told her she needed to figure out what she wanted to do.[15]She graduated from the IDHEC and since 2002 has been a professor of film at theEuropean Graduate SchoolinSaas-Fee, Switzerland.[19]
Before applying and being accepted into IDHEC, she worked as an intern at Télé Niger. After telling everyone that she wanted to apply to IDHEC, they told her, "no, don't waste your time studying, all you need to do is make films here with us".[15]
After graduating in 1971 and by this time divorced, Denis began working as an assistant director for many acclaimed filmmakers. Such films include Jacques Rivette'sOut 1(1971), Denis Dusan Makavejev'sSweet Movie(1974), Robert Enrico'sThe Old Gun(1974), Eduardo de Gregorio'sSérail(1976) and Costa-Gavras'sHanna K.(1983). After meetingWim Wenders, Denis travelled to the U.S. to be the assistant director onParis, Texas(1984) andWings of Desire(1987). Wenders has said, "Claire was more than ready to make her own films. It would have been a waste to let her continue working as an assistant director". By working with so many directors Denis realized she wanted to make her own films to have more independence and ownership of her work.[20]
Denis's feature film debut,Chocolat(1988), is a semi-autobiographical meditation about a French woman reflecting on her childhood in Cameroon and her relationship with her family's African servant. While making it, Denis began collaborating with Jean-Pol Fargeau as a co-writer. They still work together.Chocolatwas nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes and praised by critics and audiences as a remarkable first film.
Denis's second film,Man No Run(1989), is a documentary that follows a group of Cameroonian musicians,Les Têtes Brulées, touring France. It was considered an unusual second choice. Her next two narrative films wereNo Fear, No Die(S'en fout la mort, 1990) andI Can't Sleep(J'ai pas sommeil, 1994). The former is about illegal cockfighting, and the latter is about a serial killer who murders elderly women, inspired by a real case. Her next film,Nénette et Boni(1996), dives into the relationship between an alienated brother and his unhappily pregnant sister.
Denis's fifth and arguably most renowned film isBeau Travail(1999). It is about soldiers in the French Foreign Legion in Djibouti and loosely based on Herman Melville'sBilly Budd(1888).Beau Travailexplores the themes of masculinity and obsession. Her next film,Trouble Every Day(2001), was a surprise, a horror film about a newlywed couple in Paris while the husband succumbs to sexually fueled cannibalism.
Of Denis's next six films, five draw from preexisting texts and films.Friday Night(Vendredi soir, 2002) is about two strangers who spend the night together the night before the woman is supposed to move in with her current lover. It was adapted from Emmanuèle Bernheim's novel of the same name.The Intruder(L'Intrus, 2004) is based on Jean Luc Nancy's short memoir about a man receiving a heart transplant and reconnecting with his son.35 Shots of Rum(35 rhums, 2008) is another of Denis's most acclaimed films, about a father's and daughter's changing relationship. It was inspired byYasujirō Ozu's filmLate Spring(1949). Her filmBastards(Les Salauds, 2013) was inspired byAkira Kurosawa'sThe Bad Sleep Well(Warui yatsu hodo yoku nemuru, 1960).Let the Sunshine In(Un beau soleil intérieur) (2017) is a romantic comedy inspired byRoland Barthes'sA Lover's Discourse: Fragments(1977). Of these, the only film not based on preexisting text isWhite Material(2009), which was co-written with Marie N'Diaye. It is about a white French woman in post-colonial Africa who stays during a rising civil conflict.[20]
With films such asUS Go Home(1994),Nénette et Boni,Beau Travail,[21]Trouble Every Day, andVendredi soir, Denis established a reputation as a filmmaker who "has been able to reconcile the lyricism of French cinema with the impulse to capture the often harsh face of contemporary France."[21]She returned to Africa withWhite Material, set in an unidentified country during a civil war.
Denis has also made many short films spanning a multitude of subjects, such asLe 15 Mai(1969) while studying at IDHEC,Keep It for Yourself(1991) andVoilà l'enchaînement(2014). Her anthologies includePour Ushari Ahmed Mahmoud,Soudan in Lest We Forget(Contre l'oubli, (1991).US Go Home(1994) is a segment in a series of hour-long films commissioned by Arte.Nice, Very Niceis a segment inÀ propos de Nice, la suite(1995) andTowards Nancy(Vers Nancy) inTen Minutes Older:The Cello(2002). Her documentaries includeJacques Rivette, le veilleur(Jacques Rivette,the Watchman, 1990),Towards Mathilde(Vers Mathilde, 2005) andVenezia 70 – Future Reloaded(2013). She also made the short filmContact(2014) for a light installation byOlafur Eliasson, who helped on the production design forHigh Life.
Common themes in Denis's work include obsession, desire, violence, sex, and the body. It also focuses on the feelings of being an outsider and belonging. Denis has said, "For me, the monster is invisible. If there is a small thread running through all my work, it is that evil is never the other, everything is inside and never outside."[20]
Denis is a highly collaborative filmmaker, saying in an interview, "the film becomes a relationship...and that is what's important, the relationship".[22]The importance of collaboration can be seen throughout her work. She often recasts actors in multiple films, most notablyAlex Descas, who has worked with Denis 11 times from 1990 to 2017, andIsaach de Bankolé, who appeared in three of her films from 1988 to 2009.Vincent Gallo,Béatrice Dalle,Nicolas Duvauchelle,Juliette BinocheandGrégoire Colinhave also appeared in multiple Denis films. She most often collaborates with screenwriterJean-Pol Fargeau, composerStuart Staplesof the bandTindersticks, and cinematographerAgnès Godard, whom she met in the 1970s at theInstitut des hautes études cinématographiques.[22]Asked about her screenwriting process, Denis said, "I often realize I haveIsaachorGrégoireor someone else in mind" when writing scenes. She has also said that usually she "hold[s] no auditions" for her films.[22]
Fargeau has co-written ten of Denis's screenplays. Staples has composed eight of her films and Denis has said that he "has a rapport with the body, with flesh, with desire which is very close to mine". Nelly Quettier editedI Can't Sleep,Beau Travail,Vendredi soirandThe Intruder. Judy Shrewsbury has worked on every one of Denis's features for the last 20 years.[20]
Agnès Godard is one of Denis's most important collaborators, having worked on 11 of her films as a camera operator to the cinematographer in every film exceptWhite MaterialandHigh Life.
Denis has said that by collaborating with so many artists she has learned to trust the filmmaking process. She told Damon Smith: "What I got from Jacques Rivette was a complete trust in filmmaking, in actors, in acting...and a taste for endangering myself a little bit...From Wim [Wenders], I got another kind of trust, a trust in feeling very free with the camera and in designing a film not with an aesthetic, but with a complete trust of a location, in the light of the day." She also gives actors considerable freedom. InTrouble Every Daythere are two onscreen murders where she let Gallo and Dalle do what they wished after the first scripted bite.[20]
Denis's collaborations go beyond her own films, as she has appeared in other directors' films, such asLaetitia Masson'sEn avoir(1995) andTonie Marshall'sVénus beauté(1999). She shares screenwriting credit onYousry Nasrallah'sEl Medina(2000).[23]She also worked as an assistant director withWim WendersonParis, Texas(1984) andWings of Desire(1987), and withJim JarmuschonDown by Law(1986).
In 2005, Denis was a member of the jury at the27th Moscow International Film Festival.[24]In 2011, she was a member of the jury at theDeauville American Film Festival.
In 2006, Denis directed the video for the song "Incinerate" bySonic Youth, from their albumRather Ripped.
Bastardswas screened in theUn Certain Regardsection at the2013 Cannes Film Festival.[25]Also that year, Denis was awarded the Stockholm Lifetime Achievement Award at theStockholm Film Festival.
Denis announced in 2015 that she was partnering withZadie Smithfor her English-language debut film,High Life. Smith eventually left the project, causing a delay in filming. Denis went on to work onLet the Sunshine In, which starredJuliette Binocheand was released in 2017.
In 2018 Denis completed and releasedHigh Life, her first English-language feature film, withRobert Pattinsoncast as the lead.[26]The film premiered at the2018 Toronto International Film Festival. It later had a limited U.S. release by American indie distributorsA24. It was positively reviewed by many notable critics.[27][28]
Denis has been a member of multiple film festival boards, starting with theVenice Film Festivalboard in 2005. In 2019, she was the president of the board of theCinéfondationand short films at theCannes Film Festival. In 2020, she was the president of the board of the Orizzonti section at the Venice Film Festival.
In 2025, production began on the filmThe Cry of the Guardswith Denis as director.[29]
Most of Denis's œuvre uses location work rather than studio work. She sometimes places her actors as if they were positioned for still photography. She uses longer takes with a stationary camera and frames things in long shots, resulting in fewer close-ups. But Denis's cinematic and topical focus always remains relentlessly on her protagonists' faces and bodies. The subject's body in space, and how the particular terrain, weather, and colour of the landscape influence and interact with the human subjects of her films maintain cinematic dominance.
Tim Palmer explores Denis's work as a self-declared formalist and brilliant film stylist per se, an approach Denis has declared many times in interviews to be as much about sounds, textures, colours and compositions as broader thematic concerns or social commitments.[30]
According to the Australian James Phillips, Denis rejects the marketable conventions of Hollywood cinema and frees the viewers of her films from the expectations of clichés.[31]
Denis combines history with personal history, giving her films an autobiographical element.[32]This superimposition of the personal with the historical allows her films to be described asauteurcinema.[33]She has worked in many genres, from horror (Trouble Every Day) to romance and drama (Friday Night).[34]Critics have noted recurring themes in her films, but Denis says she has no coherent vision of her career "trajectory".[35]
Denis has said that she is not concerned with film theory: "I am not at all interested in theories about cinema. I am only interested in images and people and sound... Film theory is just a pain in the ass."[36]She focuses on "human" stories, no matter the setting of the film. Denis has said she does not aim to bring about radical social change or make the viewer feel better: "I'm not so sure films should be made to soothe people's pain. I don't want to be a social worker. I want to share something that is a vision, or a feeling." Her films' main focus is on the characters, often in moments of intense violence and emotion. "Anger is part of my relation to the world," she has said. "I'm filled with anger, I'm filled with regret, I'm filled with great memories, also poetic memories."[37]
Denis has said that the body is "central" to her work and often uses skin, blood, and other bodily fluids to symbolize characters' feelings and highlight relationships between them. InChocolat, skin is photographed prominently to accentuate the difference between the subservient and degrading nature of the dark-skinned Proteè's forced outdoor bathing and the shameless confidence of pale, white Luc, who chooses to do so. InTrouble Every DayandHigh Life, bodily fluids are central to the stories, creating visceral disturbing images, and highlighting the films' "sexuality".
Denis has directed a wide variety of films that span most known genres in her 30-year career, but is known for bending a genre's rules, often not obeying traditional rules of pacing or cinematography for established genres like horror, science fiction, and fantasy, focusing instead on the characters, their psyches, emotions and relationships. Though she has made horror movies and romantic comedies and dramas, Denis has never been concerned with making the scariest, funniest, or most heartbreaking films; she is only interested in telling the human story.
Denis chooses the titles of her films carefully. Noëlle Rouxel-Cubberly argues that titles are intended to force the viewer to rethink a film's imagery and that Denis uses them to describe the raw reality of her films. For example, the title ofChocolatsimultaneously refers to a racist term used during the period of the film, the cocoa exportation from Africa to Europe through a slave system, and the 1950s French expression "être chocolat", meaning "to be cheated".[38]
Denis is also known for "shooting fast, editing slowly". In general, she does a few takes on set and spends most of her time in the editing room, creating the film there. This post-production process often involves rearranging scenes out of the order in the script. For example, she placed the dance inBeau Travailat the end of the film though it was not at the end of the script. Of this process, Denis has said, "I'm always insecure when I'm making a film. I have doubts about myself but rarely about the actors."[39]
In December 2023, alongside 50 other filmmakers, Denis signed an open letter published inLibérationdemanding a ceasefire and an end to the killing of civilians amid the2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, and for a humanitarian corridor into Gaza to be established for humanitarian aid and the release of hostages.[40][41][42]

Jean-Pol Fargeau is a French screenwriter who has often collaborated with directorClaire Denis. With Denis, he co-wroteChocolat(1988),[1]Beau Travail(1999), and35 Shots of Rum(2008),[2]Bastards(2013)[3]and Denis' first English-language film,High Life(2018).[4]As of 2019, the two had made ten films together.[5]In a 2013 interview, Fargeau said of their collaboration, “It’s very strange, this partnership and relationship — we are like brother and sister,” albeit unusually free of strife for siblings.[6]They work together based in Paris.[6]
Generally their work was highly praised, drawing award nominations and strong reviews, with some exceptions. OfTrouble Every Day(2002),Stephen Holdenwrote inThe New York Times, "The story, by [Claire] Denis and Jean-Pol Fargeau, is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film, and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustratingly difficult.”[7]Still Holden called the end result a “daring, intermittently beautiful failure of a movie.”[7]
Fargeau’s memories of his own family secrets set the tone forBastards, although the particulars of the plot are not autobiographical.[6]
Fargeau has also collaborated with fashion designerAgnès B.to write the 2014 filmMy Name is Hmmm.[8]

Binoche first gained recognition for working with suchauteurdirectors asJean-Luc Godard(Hail Mary, 1985),Jacques Doillon(Family Life, 1985), andAndré Téchiné; the latter made her a star in France with a leading role in his dramaRendez-vous(1985). She won theVolpi CupandCésar Award for Best Actressfor her performance as a grieving music composer inKrzysztof Kieślowski'sThree Colours: Blue(1993) and theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actressfor playing a nurse inThe English Patient(1996).

In 2010, she won theCannes Film Festival Award for Best Actressfor her role as an antiques dealer inAbbas Kiarostami'sCertified Copy. Binoche has since starred in such films asClouds of Sils Maria(2014),High Life(2018) andThe Taste of Things(2023).
Binoche has appeared on stage intermittently, most notably in a 1998 London production ofLuigi Pirandello'sNakedand in a 2000 production ofHarold Pinter'sBetrayalon Broadway for which she was nominated for aTony Award. In 2008, she began a world tour with a modern dance productionin-idevised in collaboration withAkram Khan.
Binoche was born in Paris, the daughter of Jean-Marie Binoche, a director, actor, and sculptor, and Monique Yvette Stalens (born 1939), a teacher, director, and actress.[2]Her father, who is French, also has one eighth Portuguese-Brazilian ancestry; he was raised partly inMoroccoby his French-born parents.[3][4][5]Her mother was born inCzęstochowa, Poland.[6]Binoche's maternal grandfather, Andre Stalens, was born in Poland, of Belgian (Walloon) and French descent, and Binoche's maternal grandmother, Julia Helena Młynarczyk, was ofPolishorigin.[7]Both of them were actors who were born inCzęstochowa; theGermanNazi occupiers imprisoned them atAuschwitzas intellectuals.[6][8][9]
Her great-uncle wasLéon Binoche, who won a gold medal in rugby at the 1900 Paris Olympics.[10]
When Binoche's parents divorced in 1968, four-year-old Juliette and her sister Marion were sent to a provincial boarding school.[11]During their teens, the Binoche sisters spent their school holidays with their maternal grandmother, not seeing their parents for months at a time. Binoche has stated that this perceived parental abandonment had a profound effect on her.[12]
She was not particularly academic[13]and in her teenage years began acting at school in amateur stage productions. At seventeen, she directed and starred in a student production of theEugène Ionescoplay,Exit the King. She studied acting at theConservatoire National Supérieur d'Art Dramatique(CNSAD), but quit after a short time as she disliked the curriculum.[13]In the early 1980s, she found an agent through a friend and joined a theater troupe, touring France, Belgium and Switzerland under the pseudonym "Juliette Adrienne".[14]Around this time, she began lessons with acting coach Vera Gregh.[15]
Her first professional screen experience came as an extra in the three-partTF1television seriesDorothée, danseuse de corde(1983) directed byJacques Fansten, followed by a similarly small role in the provincial television filmFort bloquedirected by Pierrick Guinnard. After this, Binoche secured her first feature-film appearance with a minor role inPascal Kané'sLiberty Belle(1983). Her role required just two days on-set, but was enough to inspire Binoche to pursue a career in film.[13]
Binoche's early films established her as a French star of some renown.[11]In 1983, she auditioned for the female lead inJean-Luc Godard's controversialHail Mary, a modern retelling of the Virgin birth.[16]Godard requested a meeting with Binoche having seen a photo of her taken by her boyfriend at the time.[17]Although she said she spent six months on the film's set in Geneva, her presence in the final cut is confined to just a few scenes.[17][18]Further supporting roles followed in a variety of French films.Annick Lanoë'sLes Nanasgave Binoche her most noteworthy role to date, playing opposite established starsMarie-France PisierandMacha Mérilin a mainstream comedy,[19]though she has stated the experience was not particularly memorable or influential.[20]She gained more significant exposure inJacques Doillon's critically acclaimedFamily Lifecast as the volatile teenage step-daughter ofSami Frey's central character. This film was to set the tone of her early career.[21]Doillon has commented that in the original screenplay her character was written to be 14 years old, but he was so impressed with Binoche's audition he changed the character's age to 17 to allow her take the role.[22]In April 1985, Binoche followed this with another supporting role in Bob Decout'sAdieu Blaireau, apolicierthriller starringPhilippe LéotardandAnnie Girardot.Adieu Blaireaufailed to have much impact with critics or audiences.[23]
It was to be later in 1985 that Binoche would fully emerge as a leading actress with her role inAndré Téchiné'sRendez-vous. She was cast at short notice whenSandrine Bonnairehad to abandon the film due to a scheduling conflict.[24]Rendez-vouspremiered at the1985 Cannes Film Festival, winning Best Director. The film was a sensation and Binoche became the darling of the festival.[25]Rendez-Vousis the story of a provincial actress, Nina (Binoche), who arrives in Paris and embarks on a series of dysfunctional liaisons with several men, including the moody, suicidal Quentin (Lambert Wilson). However it is her collaboration with theater director Scrutzler, played byJean-Louis Trintignant, which comes to define Nina.[26]In a review ofRendez-VousinFilm Comment,Armond Whitedescribed it as "Juliette Binoche's career-defining performance".[27]
In 1986, Binoche was nominated for her firstCésarfor Best Actress in a Leading Role for her performance in the film.[28]FollowingRendez-Vous, she was unsure of what role to take next. She auditioned unsuccessfully forYves Boisset'sBleu comme l'enferandRobin Davis'sHors la loi,[26]but was eventually cast inMy Brother-in-Law Killed My Sister(1986) byJacques Rouffioopposite the popular French starsMichel SerraultandMichel Piccoli. This film was a critical and commercial failure.[29]Binoche has commented that Rouffio's film is very significant to her career as it taught her to judge roles based on the quality of the screenplay and her connection with a director, not on the reputation of other cast members.[30]Later in 1986, she again starred opposite Michel Piccoli inLeos Carax'sMauvais Sang. This film was a critical and commercial success, leading to Binoche's second César nomination.Mauvais Sangis an avant-garde thriller in which she plays Anna the vastly younger lover of Marc (Piccoli) who falls in love with Alex (Denis Lavant), a young thief.[31]Binoche has stated that she, "discovered the camera", while shooting this film.[32]
In August 1986, Binoche began filmingPhilip Kaufman's adaptation ofMilan Kundera's novelThe Unbearable Lightness of Being, portraying the young and innocent Tereza.[33]Released in 1988, this was Binoche's first English language role and was a worldwide success with critics and audiences alike.[34]Set against theUSSR's invasion ofPraguein 1968, the film tells the story of the relationships a Czech surgeon, Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis), has with his wife Tereza and his lover Sabina (Lena Olin). Binoche has stated that at the time her English was very limited and that she relied on a French translation to fully grasp her role.[35]After this success, Binoche decided to return to France rather than pursue an international career.[36]In 1988, she filmed the lead in Pierre Pradinas'sUn tour de manège, a little-seen French film oppositeFrançois Cluzet.[37]She has stated that her attraction to this film was that it gave her the opportunity to work with close friends and family.[13]Pradinas is the husband of her sister Marion Stalens who was set photographer on the film and appeared in acameo role.[13]In the summer of 1988, Binoche returned to the stage in an acclaimed production ofAnton Chekhov'sThe Seagulldirected by Russian directorAndrei KonchalovskyatThéâtre de l'Odéonin Paris.[38]
Later that year, she began work onLeos Carax'sLes Amants du Pont-Neuf.[39]The film was beset by problems and took three years to complete, requiring investment from three producers and funds from the French government.[22]When finally released in 1991,Les Amants du Pont-Neufwas a critical success. Binoche won aEuropean Film Award[40]as well as securing her third César nomination for her performance. In the film Binoche portrays an artist who lives rough on the famous Parisian bridge where she meets another young vagrant (Denis Lavant). This iconic part of the city becomes the backdrop for a wildly passionate love story and some of the most visually arresting images of the city ever created.[41]The paintings featured in the film were Binoche's own work.[22]She also designed the French poster for the film which features an ink drawing of the eponymous lovers locked in embrace.[22]During a break in filming in 1990, Binoche spent five days shootingMaraforMike Figgis, based onHenry Miller'sQuiet Days in Clichy. This 30-minute film was part ofHBO's anthology seriesWomen & Men 2.[42]The film became somewhat contentious when, according to Mike Figgis, HBO altered it once he had completed it.[43]The film premiered on HBO in the U.S. on 18 August 1991.[44]
At this point, Binoche seemed to be at a crossroads in her career. She was recognized as one of the most significant French actresses of her generation.[45]However, the long production ofLes Amants du Pont-Neufhad forced her to turn down several significant roles in international productions includingThe Double Life of VéroniquebyKrzysztof Kieślowski,Cyrano de BergeracbyJean-Paul Rappeneau,Night and DaybyChantal Akerman, andBeyond the Aegean, an aborted project withElia Kazan.[46]Binoche then chose to pursue an international career outside France.[22]
In the 1990s, Binoche was cast in a series of critically and commercially successful international films, winning her praise and awards.[47]In this period, her persona developed from that of a young gamine to a more melancholic, tragic presence.[48]Critics suggested that many of her roles were notable for her almost passive intensity in the face of tragedy and despair.[37]In fact, Binoche has nicknamed her characters from this period as her "sorrowful sisters".[49]Following the long shoot ofLes Amants du Pont-Neuf, Binoche relocated to London for the 1992 productions ofEmily Brontë's Wuthering HeightsandDamage, both of which considerably enhanced her international reputation.[50]Yet, from a professional and personal point of view, both films were significant challenges for Binoche; her casting oppositeRalph Fiennes's Heathcliff inWuthering Heights, instead of English actressesHelena Bonham Carter[51]andKate Beckinsale,[52]was immediately contentious and drew derision from the British press, unimpressed that a uniquely English role had gone to a French actress.[53]The film had its world premiere at the1992 Edinburgh International Film Festival. Reviews were poor, with Binoche being cynically dubbed "Cathy Clouseau" and derided for her"franglais"accent.[54]Both Binoche and directorPeter Kosminskydistanced themselves from the film, with Binoche refusing to do any promotion for the film or to redub it into French.[55]
Damage, a UK and French co-production, is the story of a British Conservative minister played byJeremy Ironswho embarks on a torrid affair with his son's fiancée (Binoche). Based on the novel byJosephine Hartand directed by veteran French directorLouis Malle,Damageseemed to be the ideal international vehicle for Binoche; however the production was fraught with difficulties and dogged by rumours of serious conflict. In an on-set interview, Malle stated that it was the "most difficult" film he had ever made, while Binoche commented that "the first day was one big argument".[56]Damageopened in the UK late in 1992 and debuted early in 1993 on US screens. Reviews were somewhat mixed.[57]For her performance, Binoche received her fourth César nomination.
In 1993, she appeared inKrzysztof Kieślowski'sThree Colours: Blueto much critical acclaim.[58]The first film in a trilogy inspired by the ideals of the French republic and the colors of its flag,Three Colors: Blueis the story of a young woman who loses her composer husband and daughter in a car accident. Though devastated she learns to cope by rejecting her previous life in favor of conscious "nothing"; rejecting all people, belongings and emotions.[59]Three Colours: Bluepremiered at the 1993Venice Film Festival, landing Binoche the Best Actress Prize. She also won aCésar, and a nomination for theGolden Globe. Binoche has said her inspirations for the role were her friend and coach Vernice Klier who suffered a similar tragedy, and the bookThe Black VeilbyAnny Dupereywhich deals with the author's grief at losing her parents at a young age.[60]Binoche made cameo appearances in the other two films in Kieślowski's trilogy,Three Colours: WhiteandThree Colours: Red. Around this time, Steven Spielberg offered her roles inJurassic ParkandSchindler's List. She turned down both parts.[61]After the success ofThree Colors: Blue, Binoche took a shortsabbaticalduring which she gave birth to her son Raphaël in September 1993.[62]
In 1995, Binoche returned to the screen in a big-budget adaptation ofJean Giono'sThe Horseman on the Roofdirected byJean-Paul Rappeneau. The film was particularly significant in France as it was at the time the most expensive film in the history of French cinema.[63]The film was a box office success around the world and Binoche was again nominated for a César for Best Actress. This role, as a romantic heroine, was to influence the direction of many of her subsequent roles in the late 1990s.[64]In 1996, Binoche appeared in her first comedic role sinceMy Brother-in-Law Killed My Sistera decade before;A Couch in New Yorkwas directed byChantal Akermanand co-starredWilliam Hurt. This screw-ball comedy tells the story of a New York psychiatrist who swaps homes with a Parisian dancer.[65]The film was a critical and commercial failure.[66]Three Colors: Blue,The Horseman on the RoofandA Couch in New Yorkall gave Binoche the opportunity to work with prestigious directors she had turned down during the prolonged shoot ofLes Amants du Pont-Neuf.[22]
Her next role inThe English Patientreinforced her position as an international movie star. The film, based on the novel byMichael Ondaatjeand directed byAnthony Minghella, was a worldwide hit.[67]Produced bySaul Zaentz, producer ofThe Unbearable Lightness of Being, the film reunited Juliette Binoche with Ralph Fiennes, Heathcliff to her Cathy four years previously. Binoche has said that the shoot on location in Tuscany and at the famedCinecittàin Rome was among the happiest professional experiences of her career.[11]The film, which tells the story of a badly burned, mysterious man found in the wreckage of a plane during World War II, won nineAcademy Awards, including Best Supporting Actress for Juliette Binoche.[68]With this film, she became the second French actress to win an Oscar, followingSimone Signoret's win forRoom at the Topin 1960. After this international hit, Binoche returned to France and began work oppositeDaniel AuteuilonClaude Berri'sLucie Aubrac, the true story of a French Resistance heroine. Binoche was released from the film six weeks into the shoot due to differences with Berri regarding the authenticity of his script.[69]Binoche has described this event as being like "an earthquake" to her.[11]
Next, Binoche was reunited with director André Téchiné forAlice et Martin(1998), the story of a relationship between an emotionally damaged Parisian musician and her younger lover who hides a dark family secret. The film failed to find an audience in France, although it was critically acclaimed in the UK.[70]In February 1998, Binoche made her London stage debut in a new version ofLuigi Pirandello'sClothe the Nakedre-titledNakedand adapted byNicolas Wright. The production, directed byJonathan Kent, was very favorably received.[71]Following this acclaimed performance, she returned to French screens withChildren of the Century(1999), a big budget romantic epic, in which she played 19th-century French proto-feminist authorGeorge Sand. The film depicted Sand's affair with the poet and dandyAlfred de Mussetplayed byBenoît Magimel. The following year saw Binoche in four contrasting roles, each of which enhanced her reputation.La Veuve de Saint-Pierre(2000) byPatrice Leconte, for which she was nominated for a César for Best Actress, was a period drama which saw Binoche appear oppositeDaniel Auteuilin the role of a woman who attempts to save a condemned man from the guillotine.[72]The film won favorable reviews, particularly in the U.S.[73]where it was nominated for aGolden Globefor Best Foreign Language Film.[74]
Next, she appeared inMichael Haneke'sCode Unknown, a film which was made following Binoche's approach to the Austrian director.[75]The film premiered in competition at the2000 Cannes Film Festival.[76]This critically acclaimed role was a welcome change from playing the romantic heroine in a series of costume dramas.[77]Later that year, Binoche made her Broadway debut in an adaptation ofHarold Pinter'sBetrayalfor which she was nominated for aTony Award. Staged by theRoundabout Theatre Companyand directed byDavid Leveaux, the production also featuredLiev SchreiberandJohn Slattery.[78]Back on screen, Binoche was the heroine of theLasse HallströmfilmChocolatfrom the best selling novel byJoanne Harris. For her role Binoche won aEuropean Film Audience Awardfor Best Actress and was nominated for an Academy Award and aBAFTA.[79]Chocolatis the story of a mysterious stranger who opens achocolateriein a conservative French village in 1959. The film was a worldwide hit.[80]
Between 1995 and 2000, Binoche was the advertising face of theLancômeperfumePoème, her image adorning print campaigns photographed byRichard Avedon[81]and a television advertising campaign,[82]including an advert directed byAnthony Minghellaand scored byGabriel Yared.[83]By the end of this period and following roles in a number of prestige productions, critics were wondering if Binoche wastypecastas the tragic, despairing muse. In a feature article entitled "The Erotic Face" in the June 2000 edition of British film criticism magazineSight and Sound, Ginette Vincendeau pondered Binoche's persona; Vincendeau suggested that the fixation of numerous directors upon her face had led to an erasure of her body, and to her being perceived only as a romantic icon rather than a versatile actress.[37]
After the success ofChocolat, Binoche was internationally recognized as an A-list movie star in the early 2000s, but as an actor her persona became somewhat fixed following a series ofperiod rolesportraying a stoic heroine facing tragedy and desolation.[37]Keen to try something new, Binoche returned to French cinema in 2002 in an unlikely role: she played a ditsy beautician inJet LagoppositeJean Reno.[84]The film, directed byDaniele Thompson, was a box office hit in France and Binoche was once again nominated for a César for Best Actress.[85]The film tells the story of a couple who meet at an airport during a strike. Initially the pair despises each other, but, over the course of one night, they find common ground and maybe even love. This playful spirit continued when Binoche featured in a 2003 Italian television commercial for the chocolatesFerrero Rocher. The advertisement played upon herChocolatpersona featuring Binoche handing out the chocolates to people on the streets of Paris.[86]
In a more serious vein, Binoche traveled to South Africa to makeJohn Boorman'sIn My Country(2004) oppositeSamuel L. Jackson. Based on the bookCountry of My SkullbyAntjie Krog, the film examinesThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) hearingsfollowing the abolition of Apartheid in the mid-1990s.[87]Although the film premiered at the2004 Berlin International Film Festival, it received much criticism for the inclusion of a fictional romantic liaison and for its depiction of black South Africans.[88]Despite the negative reception, Binoche was extremely enthusiastic about the film and her connection with Boorman.[89][90]Her sister, Marion Stalens, also traveled to South Africa to shoot a documentary,La réconciliation?, which explores the TRC process and follows Binoche's progress as she acts in Boorman's film.[23]Next, Binoche re-teamed with Michael Haneke forCaché. The film was an immediate success, winning best director for Haneke at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival,[91]while Binoche was nominated for a European Film Award for Best Actress for her role.[92]The film tells the story of a bourgeois Parisian couple, played by Binoche andDaniel Auteuil, who begin to receive anonymous videotapes containing footage shot over long periods, surveying the outside of their home.Cachéwent on to feature in the number one position on the "Top 10 of the 2000s" list published by The Times at the end of the decade.[93]
Binoche's next film,Bee Season, based on the celebrated novel byMyla Goldberg, cast her oppositeRichard Gere. The film was not a success at the box office taking less than $5 million worldwide.[94]For many critics the film, although intelligent, was "distant and diffuse".[95]Bee Seasondepicts the emotional disintegration of a family just as their daughter begins to win national spelling bees.Mary(2005) featured Binoche in a somewhat unlikely collaboration with the controversial American directorAbel Ferrarafor an investigation of modern faith andMary Magdalene's position within the Catholic Church.[96]FeaturingForest Whitaker,Matthew ModineandMarion Cotillard,Marywas a success, winning the Grand Prix at the 2005 Venice Film Festival. Despite these accolades and favorable reviews, particularly from the cultural magazineLes Inrockuptibles,[97]Maryfailed to secure a distributor in key markets such as the US and the UK.[98]
The Cannes Film Festival in 2006 saw Binoche feature in theanthology filmParis, je t'aimeappearing in a section directed by the Japanese directorNobuhiro Suwa. Suwa'sPlace des Victoiresis the story of a grief-stricken mother who manages to have a final brief moment with her dead son. The segment also featuresWillem DafoeandHippolyte Girardot.Paris, je t'aimewas a popular success, taking over $17 million, at the world box-office.[99]In September 2006, Binoche appeared at theVenice Film Festivalto launchA Few Days in September, written and directed bySantiago Amigorena. Despite an impressive cast includingJohn Turturro,Nick Nolteand up-and-coming French starSara Forestier, the film was a failure.A Few Days in Septemberis a thriller set between 5 and 11 September 2001, in which Binoche plays a French secret service agent, who may, or may not, have information relating to impending attacks on the U.S.[100]The film was the recipient of harsh criticism from the press for its perceived trivialisation of the events of 11 September 2001.[101]While promoting the film in the UK, Binoche told an interviewer she believed the CIA and other government agencies must have had foreknowledge of the11 September attacks, as depicted in the film.[102]
Next, Binoche traveled to the2006 Toronto International Film Festivalfor the premiere ofBreaking and Entering, her second film with Anthony Minghella in the director's chair, based on his first original screenplay since his breakthrough filmTruly, Madly, Deeply(1991). InBreaking and Entering, Binoche played a Bosnian refugee living in London, whileJude Lawco-starred as a well-to-do businessman drawn into her life via an act of deception. In preparation for her role, Binoche traveled toSarajevowhere she met women who had survived the war of the 1990s.[103]Lushly photographed byBenoît Delhomme,Breaking and Enteringportrays intersecting lives amongst the flux of urban renewal in inner-city London.[104]Despite the fact that Binoche was praised for her performance, the film did not ring true for critics and failed to find an audience.[105]In a review inVariety, Todd McCarthy writes that, "Binoche, physically unchanged as ever, plays Amira's controlled anguish with skill".[106]Breaking and Enteringalso featuredRobin Wright,Vera Farmiga,Juliet Stevenson,Rafi GavronandMartin Freeman.
Although Binoche began the decade on a professional high with an Academy Award nomination forChocolat, she struggled at the beginning of the 2000s to secure roles that did not confine her to the tragic, melancholic persona developed in the 1990s.[107]Despite the huge success ofCaché, other high-profile films such asIn My Country,Bee SeasonandBreaking and Enteringfailed critically[108]and commercially.[109]Binoche again seemed to be at a crossroads in her career.[107]
2007 was the start of a particularly busy period for Binoche, one that would see her take on diverse roles in a series of critically acclaimed international movies giving her film career a new impetus, as she shed the restrictions that seemed to have stifled her career in the early part of the decade.[107]The Cannes Film Festival saw the premiere ofFlight of the Red Balloon(2007) by the Taiwanese directorHou Hsiao-hsien. It was originally conceived as a short film to form part of a 20th anniversary tribute to theMusée d'Orsay, to be produced bySerge Lemoine, president of the museum. When that idea failed to find sufficient funding, Hou developed it into a feature-length film and secured the necessary financing.[110]The film was well received by international critics and went on to debut around the world early in 2008. Paying homage toAlbert Lamorisse's 1957 shortThe Red Balloon, Hou's film tells the story of a woman's efforts to juggle her responsibilities as a single mother with her commitment to her career as a voice artist. Shot on location in Paris, the film was entirely improvised by the cast.[111]The film was number one on the influential critic J. Hoberman's "Top 10 List" for 2008 published inThe Village Voice.[112]
She was also honored with theMaureen O'Hara Awardat theKerry Film Festivalin 2010, an award offered to women who have excelled in their chosen field in film.[113]

She arrives in Gaza during the 2005 Israelidisengagement.[114]The film won the prestigiousPremio Roberto Rossellini[115]and was critically acclaimed, particularly by the eminentCahiers du cinéma.[116]However the film proved more controversial in Israel where state television stationChannel 1withdrew financial support for the film citing the "left-wing nature of Gitai's films".[117]
In stark contrast,Peter Hedgesco-wrote and directed theDisney-producedDan in Real Life, a romantic comedy featuring Binoche alongsideSteve Carell. It was released in October 2007, becoming a popular commercial success in the US, before debuting around the world in 2008.

"I would really like to know why she has been so esteemed for so many years. She has nothing – absolutely nothing".[131]In response, while promotingCertified Copy, Binoche spoke to movie magazineEmpiresaying, "I don't know him. I understand you don't have to like everyone and you can dislike someone's work. But I don't understand the violence [of his statements]... I do not understand why he is behaving like this. It is his problem."[132]Certified Copyproved to be controversial in Kiarostami's homeland when Iranian authorities announced on 27 May 2010 that the film was to be banned in Iran, apparently due to Binoche's attire; Deputy Culture Minister Javad Shamaqdari is quoted as saying, "If Juliette Binoche were better clad it could have been screened but due to her attire there will not be a general screening."[133]

André Lauren Benjamin(born May 27, 1975), better known by his stage nameAndré 3000, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor andflautist. Born and raised inAtlanta, Georgia, he was one half of thehip hopduoOutkastalong with rapperBig Boi, which the two formed in 1992. Benjamin is widely regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time.[1][2][3][4]
As part of Outkast, the duo's six studio albums were each met with critical and commercial success, spawning hit singles including "Ms. Jackson", "Roses", "So Fresh, So Clean", and "Elevators (Me & You)", among others. Their fifth, adouble albumtitledSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below(2003), contained a solo single performed by Benjamin: "Hey Ya!", which peaked atop theBillboardHot 100and won aGrammy Award for Best Urban/Alternative Performance. After the duo split in 2007, Benjamin became less active as a solo act compared to Big Boi, although he made several highly-acclaimedguest appearanceson releases by other artists; such activity has earned him an additional threeGrammy Awardsamong eight nominations as a solo artist. Benjamin signed withEpic Recordsto release his debut studio album,New Blue Sun(2023), an instrumental recording showcasing his performances onflute.[5]The album was nominated for theAlbum of the Yearat the67th Annual Grammy Awards, his first solo nomination and third overall in the category afterStankonia(2000) andSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below(2004) with Outkast, the latter of which won the award.
Outside of music, Benjamin has acted in films and television series such asFamilies,The Shield,Be Cool,Revolver,Class of 3000,Semi-Pro,High Life,Four Brothers, and in the lead role ofJimi HendrixinAll Is by My Side. He played Fredwynn on theAMCseriesDispatches from Elsewhere, and was featured in the2022 adaptationof theDon DeLillonovelWhite Noise.
André Lauren Benjamin was born inAtlanta, Georgiaon May 27, 1975,[6]the only child of real estate agent Sharon Benjamin and collections agent Lawrence Harvey Walker.[7][8][9][10]His single mother raised him in Atlanta,East Point, andBuckhead, where he attended Sarah Smith Elementary School, Sutton Middle School, Northside High School, McClarin Success Academy, andTri-Cities High School.[11]
In high school, Benjamin (who was then performing as Dré) metAntwan "Big Boi" Pattonin 1992 at theLenox Squareshopping mall when they were both 16 years old.[12]Benjamin and Patton, also attending the same high school, teamed up to form Outkast (originally known as 2 Shades Deep). Shortly after graduating, Outkast was signed to the Atlanta-based record labelLaFace, an imprint ofArista Recordsand released their debut album,Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, in 1994. Buoyed by the success of the single "Player's Ball", the album was certifiedplatinumby theRIAAthe same year, and Outkast was named "Best New Rap Group of the Year" at the 1995Source Awards.
On their next two albums,ATLiens(1996) andAquemini(1998), Outkast experimented with their sound by adding elements oftrip hop,soul, andjungle. The albums were also influenced by a return to traditional black music genres, withfunkbeing the most prominent example. Outkast's style and lyricism again received commercial and critical acclaim. With the duo's portrayal of themselves as out-of-place extraterrestrials inATLiens, Benjamin's lyrics, in particular, were noted for theirsurreal, space-age tinge: "thefunkadelic, futuristic, and seemingly unfamiliar, weird, or eccentric persona projected by André 3000 creates the chance to transcend the more pronounced characterizations of gangstas and pimps so regularly assumed by black men rap artists."[13]During the recording of these albums, Benjamin took up guitar, painting, and a relationship with singerErykah Badu.
Outkast's fourth album,Stankonia(2000), introduced Benjamin's new alias André 3000 (largely to distinguish himself fromDr. Dreand to announce a new persona following his split with Badu) and increased the group's crossover appeal with the single "Ms. Jackson", which hit #1 on theBillboardHot 100. The song was written in the aftermath of Benjamin's breakup with Badu and was a fictionalized account of the disintegration of their relationship. In 2002, Outkast released a greatest hits album,Big Boi and Dre Present... OutKast, which contained three new tracks, one of which, "The Whole World", won aGrammyforBest Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Later that year, Benjamin participated in theDungeon Familygroup album, which saw some prominent Atlanta-based hip-hop groups combine into asupergroup. In 2002, André 3000 was referenced on the song "Till I Collapse" byEminem, who considered him one of the best rappers ever.
In 2003 Outkast releasedSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below, a double album that highlighted the differences in the musical styles of the group's two members. Though Big Boi's half of the album,Speakerboxxx, spawned the number-one hit "The Way You Move" and the relatively successful "Ghetto Musick", Benjamin'sThe Love Belowgarnered the most attention from mainstream audiences, with the popular singles "Hey Ya!" and "Roses" and theirmusic videosreceiving heavy radio and television airtime. "Prototype", the album's fourth single and video (Benjamin's third), was released shortly after. UnlikeSpeakerboxxx,The Love Belowis an exercise in funk,jazz, andalternativemusic, featuring vocals from Benjamin which are mostly sung instead of rapped.Rolling Stonecompared Benjamin to "anindie-rockLittle Richard" on "Hey Ya!" and later declared the international hit one ofThe 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[14]
In 2006, Outkast released their sixth album as a group,Idlewild, which also served as a soundtrack to the group's musical filmIdlewild. The film depicts life in a 1930s setting and the album takes influences from the music of that era, particularlyblues. Benjamin had a few rapped verses on the album, including on the first single "Mighty O", but mostly stuck with singing, as he had onThe Love Below. The album postponed the release of the theatrical film, as Benjamin and Patton were concentrated more on the production of the music than the movie. In an interview withBillboardin 2006, Benjamin explained that Outkast and its associates had developed the idea of creating a movie before the release ofAquemini, so that when it finally came time to collaborate on the movie, they already had most of the details worked out, including a script, and the movie was ultimately finished before the album was.[15]
In January 2014, it was announced that Outkast would be reuniting to celebrate their 20th anniversary by performing at more than 40 festivals worldwide during the spring/summer of 2014, beginning with a headline spot at theCoachella Valley Music and Arts FestivalinIndio, Californiain April.

Prior to the release, Benjamin commented: "It's going to be a surprise for a lot of John Legend fans because it is a lot more upbeat than John is—than people think John is. I was actually happy to hear it. This is a cool John Legend song." Benjamin has stated that he plans on recording a solo rap album and that the response to his remixes is part of the motivation for it.[17]In 2010, he was featured onCiara's remix for her single "Ride" from the albumBasic Instinct,[18]and on the remix toChris Brown's "Deuces".
