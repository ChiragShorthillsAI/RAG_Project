Doctor Sleepis a 2019 Americansupernatural horror filmwritten, directed, and edited byMike Flanagan. It is anadaptationof the2013 novel of the same namebyStephen Kingand serves as a sequel toStanley Kubrick's 1980 filmThe Shining. The film starsEwan McGregorasDan Torrance, a man with psychic abilities and a drinking problem, who struggles with childhood trauma caused by the horrors at the Overlook Hotel.Rebecca Ferguson,Kyliegh Curran, andCliff Curtishave supporting roles as new characters: Abra Stone and Billy Freeman team up with Dan to take downRose the Hatand her gang of followers.
Warner Bros. Picturesbegan developing a film adaptation shortly afterDoctor Sleepwas published in 2013. Writer-producerAkiva Goldsmanwrote a script, but the studio did not secure a budget for the film until the box office success of its 2017 horror filmIt, also based on a novel by King. Flanagan was hired to rewrite Goldsman's script and direct theDoctor Sleepfilm. Flanagan said he wanted to reconcile the differences betweenThe Shiningnoveland film. Filming began in September 2018 in Georgia, includingAtlantaand the surrounding area, and concluded that December.
Doctor Sleepheld its world premiere at theRegency Village Theaterin Los Angeles on October 21, 2019, and was theatrically released worldwide on October 31, 2019, and in the United States on November 8. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Flanagan's direction and screenplay, and the performances of the cast (especially McGregor, Ferguson, and Curran) but criticized its runtime. Grossing $72.4 million worldwide, its performance at the box office was considered adisappointmentcompared to the other King adaptations released in 2019:It Chapter TwoandPet Sematary.
After his family's1980 ordeal at the Overlook Hotel, the traumatizedDan Torranceis followed by its ghostly inhabitants seeking his "shining". The ghost ofDick Hallorannteaches him how to capture the ghosts in psychic "lockboxes". By 2011, Dan has become an alcoholic to suppress his abilities. After moving toNew Hampshire, Dan recovers throughAlcoholics Anonymous. Working as ahospiceorderly, Dan uses his shining to comfort dying patients, earning the nickname "Doctor Sleep". A young girl named Abra Stone, whose shining is even greater than Dan's,telepathicallyreaches out to him, and the two form a psychic friendship.
A separate plotline follows the True Knot, an old cult ofpsychic vampiresled by Rose the Hat. They feed on "steam", a psychic essence released by torturing and killing people who possess the shining. By 2019, as the number of potential prey dwindles, the group has begun starving. Their latest kill's traumatic death awakens Abra, who alerts Dan. Rose, who senses Abra's clairvoyance, and later becomes connected to her while shopping, becomes intrigued. Rose infiltrates Abra's dream but is trapped by Abra, who proceeds to rummage through Rose's memory to learn about the cult. Convinced that Abra's immense powers will supply them with steam for years to come, Rose sends the True Knot members after her.
Abra divines the crime scene's location and meets Dan in New Hampshire to give him the information and implore him to help her stop the True Knot. Dan recruits his friend Billy and Abra's father, Dave, to help. They set up an ambush and kill most of the cult, but Billy and Dave are killed and Abra is captured by Rose's partner, Crow Daddy. Dan possesses Abra and causes Crow Daddy's car to crash, killing him.
Knowing Rose is coming for them, Dan brings Abra to the now-abandoned Overlook, which is equally dangerous for Rose. Dan sets the hotel'sboilerto overload, while briefly confronting an apparition of his father and rejecting an offer to drink.
Rose arrives and overpowers Dan, but he releases the Overlook's occupants from his lockboxes. Drawn to Rose's power, the ghosts devour her before possessing Dan in a bid to make him kill Abra so they can feed on her steam. He goes to the boiler room and regains control before the hotel can make him deactivate it. As fire erupts, he sees a vision of himself as a child being comforted by his mother Wendy. Abra escapes as the Overlook burns down.
Sometime later, Abra speaks to Dan's spirit, who comforts her, telling her to "shine on". Abra tells her mother that Dan and her deceased father are okay. She then confronts an Overlook ghost and imprisons it in her psychic lockbox.
Additionally, Catherine Parker appears as Silent Sarey, Met Clark as Short Eddie, Selena Anduze as Apron Annie, and James Flanagan as Diesel Doug, all members of the True Knot cult.Violet McGrawportrays Violet, a child who is murdered at the start of the film by the True Knot cult and later fed to Snakebite Andi as part of her induction into the group, whileBethany Anne Lindportrays Violet's mother. Sadie and KK Heim portray the Grady sisters, with Kaitlyn McCormick and Molly Jackson providing their voices; the characters were originally played by twins Lisa and Louise Burns inThe Shining. Sallye Hooks portrays Mrs. Massey, Michael Monks portrays Delbert Grady, and Hugh Maguire portrays Horace Derwent, respectively; played by Lia Beldam and Billie Gibson,Philip Stone, and Norman Gay inThe Shining.
AuthorStephen Kingsaid he wroteDoctor Sleepbecause he wondered whatDanny Torrancewould be like as an adult. The film adaptation's director-writer-editorMike Flanaganstated, "Danny is so traumatized by what he's been through, he has no idea how to deal with this," and McGregor added, "Dan Torrance's philosophy early on in the story is not to use the shining. He's drunk to suppress the horrible visitations, the spirits that are from the Overlook Hotel."[10]
Flanagan described King'sThe Shiningas "very much about addiction, which is doom. It's about annihilation and the destruction of a family," whileDoctor Sleepwas about "recovery," stating, "In the way that addiction feels like doom and annihilation, recovery is rebirth, and recovery is salvation, in a way."[11]On themes, Flanagan has stated that "[Doctor Sleep] incorporates a lot of nostalgia from the first film... It also brings in themes that weren't in the first book, and focuses a lot more on the aspects of addiction and recovery."[12]
The Daily Bruin noted that "many elements in the film – particularly during the climax when Rose, Dan and Abra converge in a "shine" to the death – reference recognizable characters and scenes fromThe Shining."[12]
King'sThe Shiningwas a1980 film adaptationproduced, co-scribed, and directed byStanley Kubrick. King was critical of Kubrick's film to the point of writing and executive-producing a new adaptation withthe 1997 television miniseries.[13]
While theDoctor Sleepfilm is intended to be a direct adaptation of the 2013 sequel novel, Flanagan said the adaptation still "acknowledge[s] Kubrick'sThe Shiningin some way".[14]Flanagan said, "It is an adaptation of the novelDoctor Sleep, which is Stephen King's sequel to his novel,The Shining. But this also exists very much in the same cinematic universe that Kubrick established in his adaptation ofThe Shining."[15]He explained working with all the sources, "Reconciling those three, at times very different, sources has been kind of the most challenging and thrilling part of this creatively for us."[16]He first read the novel, and then had a conversation with King to work out adapting all the sources. As part of the process, Flanagan recreated scenes fromThe Shiningto use in flashbacks.[15]Same asThe Shining, Flanagan also avoided the horrorfilm tropeofjump scares.[17]
On why he wanted to present the film as a continuation of Kubrick's film, Flanagan expressed, "The Shiningis so ubiquitous and has burned itself into the collective imagination of people who love cinema in a way that so few movies have. There's no other language to tell that story in. If you say 'Overlook Hotel,' I see something. It lives right up in my brain because of Stanley Kubrick. You can't pretend that isn't the case".[18]King is famously known to dislike Kubrick's adaptation ofThe Shining,particularly due to omitting several aspects of the novel that were personal to him, such as themes related to alcoholism and its role in the disintegration of family, which Flanagan read as "an examination of his fear of what his alcoholism could do to his family... and he wrote himself hope and sacrifice at the end. None of that is present in the Kubrick film... that was a bridge too far of a personal level for him." The opening of theDoctor Sleepnovel was seen as King undoing and avoiding the changes Kubrick made to theShiningfilm.[19][20]
During early talks, King's two stipulations for theDoctor Sleepadaptation was that the Overlook would not be present, and that the novel's ending would be retained.[20]King initially rejected Flanagan's pitch of bringing back the Overlook as seen in Kubrick's film, but changed his mind after Flanagan pitched a scene within the hotel towards the end of the film that served as his reason to bring back the Overlook. Upon reading the script, King was so satisfied with the result that he said, "Everything that I ever disliked about the Kubrick version ofThe Shiningis redeemed for me here."[18]
Flanagan later revealed that there were two scenes that convinced King to accept his idea. The first was the scene involving Dan talking with The Bartender in the form of Jack, which was not adapted from either novel and was fully written by Flanagan before finishing his first draft. The second was the ending which directly adapts the final act ofThe Shiningnovel that was heavily omitted from Kubrick's film, with Dan and Abra taking the place of the novel's Jack and Danny, as well as the Overlook burning down due to the overloaded boiler. Thus, this film can be seen as a bridge for King'sDoctor SleepandThe Shining, incorporating events from both novels.[20][21][22]Flanagan said that in his film, "Almost everything Dan does [is] Jack's story from [the original novel]" and that he "really wanted to try to bring back the ending fromThe Shiningnovel and give it to Dan."[21][23]By including these elements into theDoctor Sleepfilm, Flanagan explained, "I saw it as this gift, to me as a fan, and from me to him as well — that yes, we're going to bring back this Kubrickian Overlook world, and I wanted to celebrate that film. But what if, in doing so, at the same time, you get elements of that ending of that novel,The Shining, that Kubrick jettisoned? Then you start to get the ending you never did, and that King was denied."[19]
Warner Bros. Picturesbegan developing a film adaptation ofDoctor Sleepas early as 2014.[24]In 2016, filmmakerAkiva Goldsmanannounced that he would write and produce the film for Warner Bros.[25]For several years, Warner Bros. could not secure a budget forDoctor Sleep, or for a different project, a prequel toThe ShiningcalledOverlook Hotel.[26]
In late 2017, Warner Bros. releasedIt, a film adaptation of King's1986 novel of the same name, and its box office success led the studio to fast track production ofDoctor Sleep. In January 2018, Warner Bros. hiredMike Flanaganto rewrite Goldsman's script and direct the film, with Goldsman receiving executive producer credit.[27]On why he was interested in directingDoctor Sleep, Flanagan stated, "It touches on themes that are the most attractive to me, which are childhood trauma leading into adulthood, addiction, the breakdown of a family, and the after effects, decades later."[28]
From June to November 2018, the cast was assembled.[29][30]Owing to the passage of time, many reappearing characters fromThe Shininghad to be recast. Young Danny, his mother Wendy,Dick Hallorann, and the bartender who resembles Jack Torrance all had to be recast. The denizens of the hotel—the Grady sisters, Mrs. Massey (Old Woman in Bath), Delbert Grady, and Horace Derwent—also had to be recast.
Danny Lloyd, who played young Danny Torrance inThe Shiningmakes acameo appearancein this film as an adult spectator at Bradley Trevor's baseball game. Lloyd had been retired from acting for roughly 38 years and was direct messaged onTwitterby Flanagan to appear in the film. Producer Trevor Macy said of Lloyd's involvement, "[Lloyd] was excited to do [the cameo]. He hadn't acted since [the original]. He's a schoolteacher, and a very successful one at that, like making the world better. He came back for a day, and we were thrilled to have him." When pressed as to why the filmmakers did not extend the same offer toJack Nicholson, Macy responded, "With Jack, I knew that they approached him forReady Player One, and that he seems to be very serious about being retired. I had known that he was supportive [of the sequel] but retired."[31]
Regarding the recast characters, Flanagan explained, "We explored everything, and there were only really two options as I saw it: It was either going to be something that was performed, or something that was digital. And even if we had Nicholson come back, based on the rules of the hotel and how the ghosts appear with respect to their age, he'd be performing the part through a digital avatar." Flanagan said thatde-aging and digital actors, while improving rapidly, were still inadequate. "The idea of having a digital Danny Torrance riding a trike five minutes into the movie, that just seemed like we were making a video game at that point. It felt disrespectful." Noting that any solution would be controversial, the director decided that the best approach "was not to do impressions; it was to find actors who would remind us of those iconic performances, without ever tipping into parody... I just want to be able to tilt people's memories toward those original actors, but then let the characters be their own. I want to cast someone to play Dick Hallorann; I don't want to cast someone to play Scatman Crothers".[32]The idea of casting a Nicholson impersonator as Jack was also considered, as was casting a big-name actor associated with or reminiscent of Nicholson, such asLeonardo DiCaprioorChristian Slater. Nicholson was also invited to make a cameo appearance as another character, but declined.[33]
Filming began in September 2018 in the U.S. state ofGeorgia; locations includedAtlanta,St. Marys, andSt. Simons.[34]In the area of Atlanta, specific locations includedCovington,Canton,Stone Mountain,Midtown,Porterdale, andFayetteville.[35]Production concluded in December 2018.[36]By January 2019, Flanagan was editing the film.[37]
The film score was composed bythe Newton Brothers(Andy Grush and Taylor Stewart), who also composed scores for Flanagan's previous works.[38]WaterTower Musichas released the film score. The score is heavily inspired by the music ofThe Shiningand includes a reworked rendition of the main theme, "Dies Irae".
Vintage music by Al Bowlly, Ray Noble and Henry Hall is also included in the film, reprising the key part it played in "The Shining". "Home" by Henry Hall & The Gleneagles Hotel Band is available on one release. "And The Bands Played On". Decca DDV 5001/2. The song was never issued before 1977 and was remastered by Keith Gooden & Geoff Milne at Decca in England.
Doctor Sleephad its world premiere at theRegency Village TheaterinWestwood, Los Angeleson October 21, 2019.Warner Bros. Picturesreleased the film theatrically in the United States and Canada onNovember 8, 2019.[39]They opened the film globally earlier,October 31, 2019, coinciding withHalloween.[40]The film was initially scheduled to be released on January 24, 2020.Deadline Hollywoodsaid the rescheduling reflected Warner Bros. giving "a major vote of confidence" in the film.[41]
Adirector's cutalong with the theatrical cut ofDoctor Sleepwas released onDigital HDon January 21, 2020, and was released onDVD,Blu-rayand4Kon February 4.[42][43]The director's cut is 28 minutes longer.
Doctor Sleepgrossed $31.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $40.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $72.4 million.[4][5]
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongsideLast Christmas,Midway, andPlaying with Fire, and was initially projected to gross $25–30 million from 3,855 theaters in its opening weekend.[44]BoxOfficewrote, "Early social and trailer trends are indicative of a potential box office hit should reviews and audience reception prove favorable," but added, "Doctor Sleep's primary barrier to breakout status could be how reliant it is on younger audience familiarity with the source Stephen King novels and/orThe Shining."[45]The film made $5.2 million on its first day, including a combined $1.5 million from advanced preview screenings on October 30 and Thursday night previews on November 7, lowering weekend projections to $12 million. It ended up debuting to $14.1 million, getting upset byMidwayfor the top spot.Deadline Hollywoodspeculated that despite it being "well-reviewed and well-received" by critics and audiences, the underperformance was due to the 21⁄2-hour runtime, as well as the perception the film was meant for older audiences (67% of the opening weekend attendance was over the age of 24).[3]
Following its debut, it was projected the film would lose Warner Bros. around $20 million.[46]In its second weekend the film made $6.0 million, dropping to sixth.[47]Business Insiderspeculated that, according to box-office experts, Warner Bros. overestimatedThe Shining's influence among younger audiences, who don't care much about Kubrick's film, as well as the mistake Warner Bros. made to release the film worldwide in November after Halloween.[48]
Onreview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 78% based on 331 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Doctor Sleepforsakes the elemental terror of its predecessor for a more contemplative sequel that balances poignant themes against spine-tingling chills."[49]Metacriticassigned the film a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[50]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed atPostTrakgave it an average four out of five, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it to a friend.[51]
Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comgave the film three out of four, stating, "Flanagan was tasked with making a sequel to a film that stays loyal to a book that ignores the changes made in the first movie. That ain't easy... And while one can sometimes feel Flanagan struggling to satisfy both King and Kubrick fans when he really should be trusting his own vision, he's talented enough to pull off this difficult blend of legacies."[52]Simran Hans ofThe Guardiangave the film four out of five, noting "adapting Stephen King is one thing, writing a spiritual sequel to a Stanley Kubrick movie quite another. Director Mike Flanagan takes on King's 2013 follow-up novel toThe Shining, but adjusts some details to ensure continuity with Kubrick's cult 1980 adaptation of the original book... The new material is fresher and considerably more fun."[53]
BBC's critic Nicholas Barber gave the film four out of five and stated, "Credible in its characterisation, rich in mythological detail, and touchingly sincere in its treatment of alcoholism and trauma, the film is impressive in all sorts of ways. But its greatest achievement is that it makesThe Shiningseem like a prequel—a tantalising glimpse of a richer and more substantial narrative."[54]Chris Hewitt ofEmpiregave the film three out of five and noted, "Working off source material that is very different from its predecessor, anyone expecting a straightforwardShiningsequel will be disappointed. This isn't a gruelling exercise in pure horror. It's odder and more contemplative, but worth checking in."[55]Kyle Smith ofNational Reviewwrote "Though Kubrick's adaptation andThe Shawshank Redemptionare the only films made from King's stories that achieved greatness, nearly everything he writes contains at least one brilliantly twisted element, andDoctor Sleephas lots of them. It's a shame that more top-tier directors haven't chosen to dig around in the capacious mines of King's imagination."[56]
Peter TraversofRolling Stonegave the film three out of five stars, saying: "Doctor Sleeprelies way too much on borrowed inspiration and eventually runs out of—pardon the word—steam. But this flawed hybrid of King and Kubrick still has the stuff to keep you up nights."[57]Angelica Jade BastiénofVulturewrote "The film aims in its closing moments to be bittersweet yet hopeful. Instead, it has an unintended, even dour messaging about the cost of escaping your past and whether that's even possible in life.Doctor Sleepcould probably never fully stand on its own, and perhaps it's not meant to. It's a horror film with messy pleasures if you're able to meet it on its own level."[58]Todd McCarthy ofThe Hollywood Reporterstated, "It doesn't have Jack Nicholson, Stanley Kubrick or even much of the Overlook Hotel, but Rebecca Ferguson and other good actors provide some shine of their own inDoctor Sleep, a drawn-out and seldom pulse-quickening follow-up toThe Shiningthat still has enough going on to forestall any audience slumber."[59]
Tim Grierson ofScreen Dailycommented, "For a horror director, Flanagan is particularly adept with actors, concerned more about character arcs than cheap frights. That's whyDoctor Sleep's uninspired plotting feels even more disappointing. Flanagan gives us such a sense of these people—their demons, their fears, their resilience—that it's a shame that the twists and turns aren't as compelling. Not everyone will make it out alive from the Overlook, but Flanagan brings enough smarts and soul to the flawed, fascinatingDoctor Sleepthat he manages to escapeThe Shining's shadow mostly unscathed."[60]Michael O'Sullivan ofThe Washington Postgave the film two stars out of four and wrote "Part homage to Kubrick's moody atmospherics, and part hyper-literal superhero story,Doctor Sleepis stylish, engrossing, at times frustratingly illogical and, ultimately less than profoundly unsettling...Doctor Sleepwill by no means make you drowsy, but it won't keep anyone up at night either."[61]Austin Collins ofVanity Fairadded "Doctor Sleepis a horror movie, but what's immediately striking is its sudden breadth, it's humble resistance to the usual perils and thrills of blockbuster. It's refreshing. This is a story that feels larger than it is, in part because this story takes the shine and does something with it, reveals it for the tenuous, impermanent, vulnerable force that it is."[62]Michael Roffman ofConsequence of Soundmentioned "Doctor Sleepshouldn't work. Even now, the idea of making a big-budget sequel to arguably the greatest horror film of all time reads like a disaster on paper. Yet, to our surprise, Flanagan's execution warrants its existence."[63]
Tom Philip ofGQwrote, "while Flanagan delivers an ending that sort of respects King's book and rhymes withThe Shining's filmed conclusion, it all feels quite forced. At its heart, this is a film about a son rejecting his destiny to become his ghoulish father and forge his own path. It's a shameDoctor Sleepdoesn't have the guts to do the same."[64]
David Sims ofThe Atlanticsaid, "Flanagan clearly understands how Kubrick's adaptation eclipsed King's attachment to the original story and became entrenched in the broader culture. But this movie is still just a very good facsimile.Doctor Sleepis wonderfully reverent when it comes to Kubrick's film, but that means it can't escapeThe Shining's shadow, no matter how much King might have wanted it to."[65]Eric Kohn ofIndieWiregave the film a C+ grade, commenting, "...Doctor Sleepshows considerable effort to ingratiate itself to discerning cinephiles, from the moody Newton Brothers score to cinematographer Michael Fimognari's dark blue nighttime palette; as a whole, the movie conjures an eerie and wondrous atmosphere that blends abject terror with a somber, mournful quality unique to Flanagan's oeuvre. But his pandering to dueling source material results in a jagged puzzle beneath both of their standards".[66]Alison Foreman ofMashablestated, "Doctor Sleepcould have tried to beThe Shining's sequel, an intimidated son yearning to be like his father. Instead, it's entirely new...Doctor Sleepisn'tThe Shining, but it does shine."[67]Justin Chang ofLos Angeles Timeswrote, "You can't blame Flanagan for fetishizing the visual iconography of Kubrick's movie, for plunging back into his funhouse of horrors like the proverbial kid in a candy store. But the effect can't help but fundamentally alter the tone and intent ofDoctor Sleep, briefly transforming a richly disturbing fantasy into an extravagant act offan service. It taps into the minutiae of Kubrick's masterwork without fully teasing out its mystery."[68]
Prior to the film's release, Warner Bros. had enough confidence in the film that they hired Flanagan to script a prequel with the working titleHallorann, focusing on the character ofDick Hallorann. Following the disappointing box-office performance ofDoctor Sleep, the project was scrapped.[70]
Flanagan also confirmed that he was interested in directing a sequel focused onAbra Stone, and that he had asked King, who was open to the idea.[71]

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros.

Other frequent collaborators includeCarla Gugino,Henry Thomas,Samantha Sloyan,Rahul Kohli,Bruce Greenwood,Zach Gilford,Michael Trucco,Annalise Basso,Lulu Wilson,Annabeth Gish, Katie Parker andAlex Essoe.
Mike Flanagan was born inSalem, Massachusetts, on May 20, 1978.[1][2]His family moved around often due to his father's job in theU.S. Coast Guard, at one point living onGovernors Island.[3]Although he only briefly lived in Salem, it left an impression on him, and he retained an interest in both theSalem witch trialsand associated topics such as ghost stories and horror fiction.[2]
He later lived inMaryland, where he was a student atArchbishop Spalding High Schoolbefore attendingTowson University.[2]He graduated with aBA, majoring in Electronic Media & Film and minoring in Theater.[4]
Flanagan's student films were more oriented toward melodrama.  He later characterized them as "unfit for public consumption" but called them "incredible learning experiences".[2]After graduating, he directedGhosts of Hamilton Street(2003), filmed in Maryland with local actors,[5]including Scott Graham, whom Flanagan met at Towson. Graham would go on to star in Flanagan's 2006 short film,Oculus: Chapter 3 – The Man with the Plan, which he made for $1,500.[4]
Flanagan originally intended for theOculusstory to be told in a series of short films, but he could not find the financing.  Instead, he shot the chapter that included a back story and used that to demonstrate that he could direct a horror film. The short proved popular at film festivals, and producers were interested in developing the concept. However, they either wanted to shoot it as a found footage film or rejected Flanagan's stipulation that he direct the feature-length adaptation. Flanagan  directedAbsentia(2011), which was financed through aKickstartercampaign, in response to this rejection.[2]Made for $70,000 and filmed in hisGlendale, California, apartment,Absentiawas releaseddirect-to-videobut gained popularity whenNetflixoffered it on its streaming service.[6]After its surprise success, Flanagan continued to shopOculusaround.Intrepid Picturestook an interest in the concept and agreed to let Flanagan direct.

After a year in bankruptcy court, Relativity announced thatBefore I Wakewould be released on April 8, 2016, but missed that date as the company struggled to get back on its feet.[8]The film was then scheduled for September 9, 2016, but Relativity once again pulled the film three weeks ahead of this date, prompting a public argument between Flanagan and Relativity CEO Ryan Kavanaugh onTwitter; Kavanaugh claimed September 9 was a "bad date" while Flanagan suggested that Relativity was financially unable to release the film.[9]Relativity never released the film as Kavanaugh sold the company to Singaporean social network YuuZoo in October 2016,[10]with Netflix eventually acquiring the rights to the film and releasing it in January 2018.[11]
