Rønning, who co-directedPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales(2017) for Disney, was hired to direct the film in October 2017.

It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Jolie, Fanning, and Pfeiffer, while criticizing the "muddled" plot and "overly artificial" visuals.[4]The film grossed $491 million worldwide, although it needed to make around $500 million in order to make a profit when factoring in total budget, marketing and distribution costs.[5]It also received anAcademy Awardnomination forBest Makeup and Hairstylingat the92nd Academy Awards. A third film is currently in development.
Five years sinceKing Stefan's death,[N 1]Aurorahas benevolently reigned as Queen of the Moors, alongsideMaleficentas its powerful guardian and protector. Despite her service, the neighbouring kingdom of Ulstead, home to Aurora's boyfriendPrince Philip, still sees Maleficent as a dangerous villain.Diaval, Maleficent's raven and confidant, overhears Aurora accepting Philip's marriage proposal. When he relays this to Maleficent, she advises against the union, though Aurora vows to prove her wrong.
Philip's parents,King Johnand Queen Ingrith, host an intimate dinner to celebrate the engagement. Maleficent maintains her composure after Ingrith tauntingly mentions Aurora's sleeping curse and Stefan's death. She openly claims Maleficent killed two human fairy poachers last seen near the Moors. When Ingrith carelessly dismisses Maleficent's maternal bond with Aurora, Maleficent reacts angrily and seemingly curses John, who suddenly falls into a deep slumber. Maleficent says she did not curse him, though Aurora disbelieves her. Philip urges his mother to try and awaken the King with a kiss. Ingrith resists, and her weak attempt fails because she does not love John. As Maleficent flees the castle, Ingrith's servant, Gerda, shoots Maleficent with an iron bullet.
Wounded, Maleficent falls into the ocean and is rescued by a mysterious winged creature. She awakens in a cavern where fairies like herself have been in hiding. Among them is Conall, their peaceful leader who saved Maleficent, and Borra, a warlike fairy who favors open conflict with humans and killed the poachers near the Moors. Maleficent is among the last creatures known as Dark Fey, powerful fairies forced into hiding and nearly driven extinct by human oppression. She is also the last descendant from thePhoenix, an ancient and powerful Dark Fey ancestor. Because Maleficent's magic is so powerful, Conall and Borra believe she is instrumental in ending the conflict with humans through peace or war.
Meanwhile, Aurora grows disillusioned with being an Ulstead noblewoman but is happy that the Moor denizens are invited to the royal wedding. Aurora discovers that Ingrith hates all Moor fairy folk, bitterly resenting their prosperity during one winter when her kingdom had suffered and blaming them for her brother's death. Ingrith secretly plots to eradicate all fairies and woodland beings using iron weapons and a lethal crimson powder developed by Lickspittle, a de-winged pixie. Aurora also learns that Ingrith cursed John, using Maleficent's cursed spindle, which Ingrith had somehow taken to Ulstead. Ingrith finds out and has Aurora imprisoned. The Moor folk are trapped inside the castle's chapel when they arrive. At Ingrith's command, Gerda unleashes the deadly crimson powder by playing the chapel's organ. The fairy Flittle selflessly sacrifices herself to save everyone as a last resort by clogging the organ, rendering the organ unplayable, while fairies Knotgrass and Thistlewit cause Gerda to fall to her death.
The Dark Fey attack Ulstead, but soldiers slaughter them until Maleficent joins the battle, wielding Phoenix power. She nearly kills Queen Ingrith, but Aurora appeals to Maleficent's humanity, claiming her as mother. Distracted, Maleficent is struck by the Queen's arrow, dissolving into ashes. Devastated, Aurora mourns, yet her tears revive Maleficent as a Phoenix. Terrified, Ingrith throws Aurora from the tower and flees, but Maleficent saves her. Borra and the Dark Fey stop Ingrith's escape.
Philip forges peace between the fairies and humans, causing the Ulstead soldiers to stand down. Maleficent reverts to her fairy form and bestows her blessing upon Aurora and Philip. After receiving it from Lickspittle, Maleficent destroys the spindle and its curse, awakening John from his slumber. As punishment for her crimes, Ingrith is transformed into a goat by Maleficent, until she can embrace peace between the two peoples.
After Aurora and Philip are wed, Maleficent returns to the Moors with the other Dark Fey. She promises to return for the christening of Aurora and Philip's future child.
On June 3, 2014, following the release of the first film,Angelina Joliehinted that a sequel toMaleficentwas a possibility.[13]On June 15, 2015,Walt Disney Picturesannounced that the sequel was in the works and thatLinda Woolvertonwould return to write the screenplay for the film.[14]On April 25, 2016, Disney officially confirmed Jolie's return as the title character.[15]On August 29, 2017,Joe Rothwas confirmed as returning as producer.[16]In September 2017, Jolie stated that they "have been working on the script and this is going to be a really strong sequel."[17]On October 3, 2017,Deadlinereported that the film would be directed byJoachim Rønningand it would start filming in the first quarter of 2018.[18]

Principal photographybegan on May 29, 2018, atPinewood StudiosinBuckinghamshire, England.[26][29]Filmingwrappedon August 24, 2018.[30][31]
The visual effects were provided byThe Moving Picture Companyand Mill Film, which was supervised by Jessica Norman, Damien Stumpf, Brian Litson, Ferran Domenech, and Laurent Gillet, withGary Brozenichserving as the Overall Supervisor.[32]
According toGary Brozenich, the majority of the film's effects were for the enormous battle sequences taking place in and around Castle Ulstead and Queen Ingrith's creation, a mix of fairy dust and iron which turns into a red powder-like substance that destroys the creatures in the film, and is brilliantly realized on-screen as explosions of red smoke in the sky.[33]
When visualizing the film, DirectorJoachim Rønningpictured the red dust bombs exploding over Berlin duringWorld War II. The wings for Maleficent—who had three different looks, were created with CG effects in post-production, but the simulated flying was completed during principal photography. He and the team were determined to make all the flying sequences look as effortless and real as possible, while keeping the actors safe. The actors wore a tuning fork rig that attached to the actor's hips and was controlled by operators off set. This gave the actors the ability to hover and dive, which makes the action look very fluid and natural.[33]
On May 22, 2019, it was revealed that the film's score would be composed byGeoff Zanelli, replacingJames Newton Howardfrom the previous film.[34]The film marks Zanelli and Rønning's second collaboration, afterPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.[34]Zanelli said that "the storytelling inMaleficent: Mistress of Evilis fantastic", for which he said that "writing [the film's] score is a dream come true".[34]On September 20, 2019, the song "You Can't Stop the Girl" byBebe Rexha, from the film's soundtrack, was released as a single.[35]The score album was released on October 18, 2019 byWalt Disney Records.

It went on to debut to $36.9 million, finishing first at the box office but marking a 47% decline from the $69.4 million opening of the first film.[47]The lower-than-expected opening was blamed on the five years between installments, mixed critical reviews and competition from fellow releases.[2][5]In its second weekend, the film made $19.4 million, retaining the top spot at the box office, before falling to third place in its third weekend with $13.1 million.[48][49]

Los Angeles Timesfilm critic Justin Chang calls the film (written by returning scribeLinda WoolvertonandA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhoodco-writersNoah HarpsterandMicah Fitzerman-Blue) an "enjoyably deranged" continuation of the first movie thanks to Jolie's commitment to the character's grim quirks, though he ultimately notes the "flat dialogue, overblown battles, and cloying CGI critters" weigh down the film's merits.[53]IndieWire's Eric Kohn adds that Jolie's natural charm adds so much "delicious flamboyance to this striking villainess that she outshines the latest heavy-handed Disney refashioning" before quipping that "only the world's biggest movie star could upstage her own movie with each fearsome scowl."[54]
A thirdMaleficentfilm was announced to be in development in September 2021, withAngelina Jolieattached to the project as a producer. The first draft of the script had already been written at that time, byLinda WoolvertonandEvan Spiliotopoulos.[59]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle.

When asked what inspired him to become a filmmaker, Rønning said his father being a part of the local theater company immersed his young self with experience of sitting backstage and having views of the productions' inner workings.
In 1992, he attended Stockholms Filmskola in Sweden, graduating in 1994.[4]

Linda Woolverton(born December 19, 1952) is an American screenwriter, playwright, and novelist, whose most prominent works include the screenplays and books of several acclaimedDisneyfilms and stage musicals. She is the first woman to have written an animated feature for Disney,Beauty and the Beast(1991),[1]which is also the first animated film ever to be nominated for the Academy Award forBest Picture. She also co-wrote the screenplay ofThe Lion King(1994), provided additional story material forMulan(1998), and adapted her ownBeauty and the Beastscreenplay into the book of theBroadway adaptation of the film, for which she received aTony Awardnomination and won anOlivier Award.[2][3]
Her recent work includes the screenplays forAlice in Wonderland(2010) andMaleficent(2014), both of which were significant box office successes. The former made her the first female screenwriter with a sole writing credit on afilm that grossed $1 billion.[4]She subsequently wrote the screenplays of the sequels for both of those films—Alice Through the Looking Glass(2016) andMaleficent: Mistress of Evil(2019).
Woolverton was born in 1952 inLong Beach, California. As a child, she began acting in the local children's theater as an escape from what she has described as a "traumatic childhood."[1]She graduated from high school in 1969 with honors in the school's theater program. She attendedCalifornia State University, Long Beach, graduating with a BFA in Theater Arts in 1973. After the college graduation, she attended theCalifornia State University, Fullerton. She received her Master's degree in theater for children in 1979.[5]
Upon the completion of her master's degree, Woolverton formed her own children's theater company. She wrote, directed and performed all over California in churches, malls, schools, and local theaters. She also began to work as a creative drama instructor in 1979.[5]In 1980, she began working as a secretary forCBS, where she eventually became a programming executive concentrating on both children's and late-night programming. During her lunch breaks, Woolverton wrote her first novel, theyoung adultStar Wind. After quitting her job in 1984 and starting working as a substitute teacher, she wrote her second novel, the also young adultRunning Before the Wind.[6]Released in 1986 and 1987, respectively, both were published byHoughton Mifflin.
During this time, Woolverton began penning scripts for children's television shows. From 1986 to 1989, she wrote episodes for animated series asStar Wars: Ewoks,Dennis the Menace,The Real Ghostbusters,The Berenstain Bears,My Little PonyandChip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers.[5]After growing tired of writing for animated television shows, she expressed interest in working forDisney'stheatrical animation studio, but was discouraged by her agent, who assessed that she "wasn't ready." Not agreeing with it, Woolverton went over to Disney offices inBurbank, California, and dropped off a copy ofRunning Before the Windto a secretary, asking her to "give it to somebody to read."[6]Two days later, she received a call fromJeffrey Katzenberg, then-Disney studio chairman, scheduling her for an interview.[6][7]
Woolverton was hired to write the script forDisney Feature Animation'sBeauty and the Beast, thus becoming the first woman to write an animated feature for the studio.[1]From early 1985 to 1988, two different teams of writers had taken a turn at adaptingJeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont'staleinto a feature film, but Woolverton succeeded by incorporating her own ideas into the story, such as making the protagonist a bookworm. Upon its release in 1991,Beauty and the Beastreceived universal acclaim, becoming the first animated film ever to be nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Picture, and winning theGolden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.
The success ofBeauty and the Beastled Woolverton to work in several projects with Disney. She co-wrote the screenplay of the live-action filmHomeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, released in 1993, and worked again with Disney Animation by helping the pre-production story development ofAladdin, released in 1992, and co-writing the screenplay ofThe Lion King, released in 1994.AladdinandThe Lion Kingwere both critical and box office hits. During this time, she also adapted her ownBeauty and the Beastscreenplay into aBroadway musical, which opened to critical acclaim in 1994, leading her to be nominated for a Tony Award for Best Book in a Musical and to win an Olivier Award for Best New Musical.[2][3]She provided additional story material forMulan, released in 1998, and co-wrote the book of the stage musicalAida, which opened on Broadway in 2000 to critical acclaim.
In 2007, she completed a screenplay where an olderAlice, fromLewis Carroll'sAlice's Adventures in Wonderland, returns toWonderland, from an idea she had in her head for many years. She presented the screenplay to producersSuzanne Todd,Jennifer Todd, andJoe Roth, who took it to Disney. The studio immediately accepted the project, attachingTim Burtonto direct.[8]Released in 2010,Alice in Wonderlandearned more than $1 billion at the worldwide box office, making Woolverton the first female screenwriter with a sole writing credit on afilm that grossed $1 billion.[4]
In 2010, Disney invited her to write the screenplay ofMaleficent, a retelling of the animated filmSleeping Beautyfrom the point of view ofthe titular villain. As withBeauty and the Beast, the film had been indevelopment helluntil Woolverton was attached to write it. She later described her version of the tale as a complete "reinvention, not just the retelling of the same story."[9]Maleficentwas released in 2014.[10][11]
She subsequently wrote the screenplays of the sequels for both of those films—Alice Through the Looking Glass(2016) andMaleficent: Mistress of Evil(2019).[12][13]
Woolverton wrote the book of the Broadway musicalLestat, an adaptation ofThe Vampire ChroniclesbyAnne Rice, which pre-debuted in 2005 in San Francisco to become the highest-earning pre-Broadway play in the city's history. The musical opened on Broadway in 2006. She co-wrote the narration script of theNational Geographictheatricaldocumentary filmArctic Tale, released in 2007. In 2014, she announced that she was pitching apilotfor a television series.[14][15][16]It was later announced thatLifetimehad decided to adapt the novelThe Clan of the Cave Bearwith Woolverton as executive-producer of the series and writer of the pilot episode.[17]The adaptation eventually was released as a television film.
Woolverton's works are known for their "strong female characters."[19]She is recognized for having paved the way inside Disney for the creation of strong female protagonists, mainly due to her writing ofBelle, the protagonist ofBeauty and the Beast. Belle is an intelligent and strong young woman, a Disney heroine who does "something other than wait for her prince to come."[1]Empirehailed Belle as "afeministheroine who [is] more rounded than previous Disney characters."[20]Woolverton herself said that Belle "moved us forward a few inches. She was a reader. She didn't rely on her beauty to get herself through the world. She wasn't a victim waiting for her prince to come. She was a proactive character."[21]
InAlice in Wonderland, she gave the protagonist Alice Kingsleigh an adventurous, inquisitive, nonconforming personality, which leads the character to question thevalues of the Victorian society, and ultimately dismantle an engagement to become a world explorer. For this,Ellesaid: "In her version of Wonderland, she [Woolverton] gave audiences a female character that was not dependent on a man for happiness or commercial success."[4]Describing her work in the film, Woolverton said: "My whole point in Alice was that you have to forge your own path. You can't go down anybody else's [road]. It's your dream; it's your life. You don't have to be told by other people what to make of yourself. You decide."[21]
Reflecting on her female characters, Woolverton said: "I came up as a feminist, in my day. And when I was first approached to doBeauty and the Beast, I knew that you couldn’t do a throwback Disney victim/heroine. We weren’t going to buy it as women after a whole awakening in the 70s. No one is going to accept that. So that started me on a path at relooking at these Disney princesses in a sort of different way. I feel that you have to have an empowering message or you’re not going to be relevant. If you don't stay relevant to how people are and how women are approaching life now, it’s not going to feel true."[22]
Woolverton is divorced from producer Lee Flicker, with whom she has a daughter, named Keaton,[6]born in 1991.[23]She lives inHancock Park, Los Angeles,[6]and had two dogs in 2014.[16]She is represented byUnited Talent Agency.[24]

On casting, directorSteve McQueensaid:
Chiwetel Ejiofor was always going to be Solomon Northup for me. I was looking for someone that had that genteelness, that kind of humanity. Knowing that humanity was going to be tested under certain duress and circumstances, I needed a person who could actually keep hold of that, even through periods of extraordinary trying and extraordinary situations where it would be tested to its absolute limit. He was the only person.[22]
At the Toronto International Film Festival, Ejiofor said he briefly hesitated about playing Northup. "You wait all your life for a great script to come through the door. You're hassling your agent and all that, and then it comes and you read it and your first reaction surprises you. Your first reaction being, 'Can I do this?'"[23]He accepted the role about 24 hours later.[24]As part of his preparation for the role, Ejiofor learned to play the violin, collected slave stories, maintained a slave's edge up hairstyle, and engaged in some of the physical labour that Northup was subject to, including cotton picking.[25]Since he had not worked with McQueen before, Ejiofor also observed the working dynamic between the director and co-starMichael Fassbender, who worked with McQueen onHunger(2008) andShame(2011).[26]On playing Northup, Ejiofor did feel a responsibility, not being American, to get the story of Solomon Northup as current he could, adding "I've been very grateful to show the film to his descendants and see them be so proud of it."[27]
12 Years a Slaveopened to wide acclaim, with many critics citing Ejiofor's performance and declaring him an almost-certain Academy Award nominee for Best Actor.[23][25][27][28]FromOwen GleibermanatEntertainment Weekly: "It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence."[29]FromChristopher OrratThe Atlantic: "Ejiofor has given notable performances in the past (Dirty Pretty Things,Serenity,Talk to Me), but this is by far his most essential role to date. Stoic, watchful, compromising himself just enough to stay alive, he is the point of stillness and decency around which spin the madnesses of the film."[30]In hisThe Hollywood Reporterreview,Todd McCarthywrote, "Ejiofor is terrific in a demanding character who's put through the wringer physically, mentally and emotionally."[31]On 16 January 2014, Ejiofor was officially nominated for Best Actor for the 86th Academy Awards on 2 March.

He's possessed with this disease of his own ego and his own want."[39][40]Favreau said of casting Ejiofor, "[He] is just a fantastic actor, who brings us a bit of the mid-Atlantic cadence and a new take on the character. He brings that feeling of a Shakespearean villain to bear because of his background as an actor. It's wonderful when you have somebody as experienced and seasoned as Chiwetel; he just breathes such wonderful life into this character."[41]Ejiofor narrated the 2019 documentary filmThe Elephant Queen.[42]In 2019, Ejiofor made his feature directorial debut withThe Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, adapted from the memoir of the same name fromWilliam Kamkwamba, about a boy who built a wind-powered water pump inMalawi.[43]In 2022, Ejiofor returned to the role ofMordofor the sequel filmDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.
