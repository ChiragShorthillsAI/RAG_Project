The Report(styled asTheTortureReport) is a 2019 Americanhistoricalpolitical dramafilm written and directed byScott Z. Burnsthat starsAdam Driver,Annette Bening,Jon Hamm,Ted Levine,Michael C. Hall,Tim Blake Nelson,Corey Stoll, andMaura Tierney. It depicts the efforts of stafferDaniel Jonesas he led theSenate Intelligence Committee's investigation of theCentral Intelligence Agency'suse of torturefollowing theSeptember 11th attacks, covering more than a decade's worth of real-life political intrigue related to the contents, creation, and release of the 6,700-pageSenate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture.[4]
The film had its world premiere at the2019 Sundance Film Festivalon January 26, 2019. It was released in theaters in the United States byAmazon Studioson November 15, 2019, two weeks before it began streaming onAmazon Primeon November 29. Critical reviews of the film were generally positive.
In early 2009, having just spent two years investigatingthe 2005 destruction of CIA interrogation videotapes,[5]Daniel J. Jones, a Senate staffer, is selected by SenatorDianne Feinsteinto lead a review of six million pages of CIA materials related to the agency's use ofenhanced interrogation techniques(EITs). Jones and his small team of six get to work in asensitive compartmented information facilityat a covert CIA site in Virginia.
As Jones begins his work, the narrative shifts back to theSeptember 11 attacksof 2001, with CIA employees at theCounterterrorist Center(CTC), including Bernadette and Gretchen, anxiously watching live videos of the attacks. At CIA headquarters a few days later,DCIGeorge Tenetreports on his meeting atCamp Davidwith PresidentGeorge W. Bushand CTC directorCofer Black.John Rizzo, the CIA's legal counsel, reports that the president has given the CIA powers to "capture and detain suspected terrorists." The next year, intelligence psychologistsBruce JessenandJames Elmer Mitchellare contracted to instruct the CIA in EITs.
Although he loses half of his team after theDepartment of Justice(DOJ) begins its own investigation of the CIA and the CIA decides to only allow its personnel to speak to the DOJ, Jones continues his investigation with his remaining staff: April and Julian. Jones meets withFBIagentAli Soufanand learns more about the CIA's interrogation program, particularly regardingAbu Zubaydah. Theinterrogation of Abu Zubaydahis shown, contrasting the FBI's use of rapport-building with the CIA's use of EITs. Bernadette observes the sessions, and she defends the use of the new techniques. Soufan says he gathered crucial intelligence from Zubaydah before the CIA took over the interrogations,[6][7][8]though the CIA disagrees on what techniques are most effective and what results came from what approach.[9]
At a briefing with Senator Feinstein in her office, Jones describes evidence from the CIA's own records that prove the agency knew Zubaydah was not a high-ranking member ofAl-Qaeda, as they falsely reported to the DOJ. After the CIA told the Bush administration that Zubaydah was a key player, they received authorization in the August 2002 CIA "Torture Memos" drafted by Deputy Assistant Attorney GeneralJohn Yooto use EITs on him, making Zubaydah the first detainee to be tortured.[10]
Raymond Nathan, aphysician assistantwith the Office of Medical Services who works at aCIA black site, secretly meets with Jones, saying he and other medical professionals had complained that the EITs were torture, but the only response they received was a cable from DirectorJose Rodrigueztelling them to stop putting their objections in writing. Nathan witnessed thewaterboardingof Zubaydah, who lost consciousness and almost drowned during the procedure.
April and Jones uncover the story ofGul Rahman, who died fromhypothermiain 2002 after CIA interrogators threw water on him and left him chained to the ground overnight in a 36 °F (2 °C) cell. Jones meets with Senator Feinstein and her staffer Marcy Morris to inform them about the CIAinspector general'sreport of the incident. Jones also deduces thatnational security advisorCondoleezza Ricehad been told to not inform the president about the Torture Memos, which President Bush only learned about in April 2006.
Among the files provided to him by the CIA, Jones finds thePanetta Review, a harshly critical internal CIA review of the EIT program that was prepared in 2009 but never shared.[Notes 1]While watching TV at a bar after work, April, Julian, and Jones become discouraged as they watch a pundit on the news claim that EITs had yielded good intelligence and prevented terrorist attacks. Jones stays up all night to disprove the claims, and the CIA's own records show that crucial information it is claiming to have obtained by subjectingKhalid Sheikh Mohammad(aka "KSM") to torture was obtained by other means.
Seen in flashback, Mitchell and Jessen waterboard KSM in March 2003. Mitchell complains that, when waterboarded, Muhammad makes up lies to make it stop. Bernadette, who has been observing from another room, questions the contractors about the effectiveness of their techniques, but the torture continues.
The DOJ concludes its investigation of the CIA, and files no charges. April accepts another job offer and leaves Jones's team.
In April 2004, theAbu Ghraib torture and prisoner abusescandal hits the news, which is particularly embarrassing, as President Bush had recently denounced the use of torture in an address to the United Nations.[11]Jack Goldsmith, the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel's new head, repudiates and withdraws the Torture Memos. Tenet, Rodriguez, Rizzo, Thomas Eastman, Bernadette, Mitchell, and Jessen meet to discuss how to respond. Mitchell gives an impassioned speech in defense of his methods, and Rodriguez has the program re-certified.
Jones and Julian finish the 6,200-page report, and it is approved by theSenate Intelligence Committee, chaired by Senator Feinstein, on December 13, 2012, and sent to the CIA for final comments. Two months later,John Brennanis sworn in as the newdirector of the CIA. Brennan tells Jones and Senator Feinstein that he disagrees with many parts of the report and will not allow it to be published without modification, so Jones has a series of meetings with CIA representatives, who raise several objections to key findings in the report, such as that no unique intel was obtained by using EITs, or the fact that Mitchell and Jessen were unqualified to be offering advice on interrogation techniques, but were nevertheless paid $81 million of taxpayer money for their efforts. Senator Feinstein listens to Jones's defense of his report after these meetings and eventually tells him to stop going to them.
Frustrated, Jones reveals some of the contents of the Panetta Review to SenatorMark Udallof the Intelligence Committee. Senator Udall confrontsCaroline Krassduring a December 17, 2013, Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Krass's nomination to the position of CIA general counsel, stating that he is "more confident than ever of the accuracy of the committee's 6,300 page study." He then reveals the existence of the Panetta Review by saying that the Intelligence Committee's report is consistent with the CIA's own study of the EIT program initiated by former directorLeon Panetta, while both reports conflict with the CIA's official response to the Senate report.[12]Meanwhile, Jones, who is fearful that the CIA will attempt to destroy all copies of the Panetta Review, like they destroyed the interrogation videotapes, secretly moves a copy of a portion of the review into a safe in his office in theSenate Hart Building.
The CIA, humiliated by Udall's revelation, conducts a search of Jones's workspace, violating the agreement between the Senate and the CIA. They threaten to prosecute Jones for "stealing" the Panetta Review from the CIA's computers, and Jones's lawyer, Cyrus Clifford, advises him that he does not have a legal problem, but a "sunlight"—that is,transparency—problem.[13]Jones meets with aNew York Timesnational security reporter and suggests he look into the hacking of Senate computers by the CIA, careful to provide no specific details. When theTimesarticle is published, Jones is called into a meeting with Morris and Senator Feinstein, who is visibly angry with him, but ultimately makes a speech supporting him andformally accusing the CIA of unlawfully searching the Senate's computersin violation of theseparation of powers. Brennan and the CIA are forced to back down, and the charges against Jones are dropped.
Senator Feinstein tells Jones that she is prepared to release a shorter summary of the report, but PresidentBarack Obamagrants the CIA broad authority to redact it first. Jones points out that the CIA's proposed heavy redactions make many of the revelations detailed in the summary impossible to follow, but the agency claims that even the pseudonyms used could endanger the lives of its agents. In the face of unrelenting efforts to block the release of the summary, Jones again meets with theNew York Timesreporter, but ultimately decides not to leak the report to the media.[14]
TheRepublican Partywins control of the Senate in theNovember 2014 midterm elections, meaning the report will likely be buried forever when the new Congress is sworn in January 2015. Faced with this deadline, the Senate finally agrees to release the summary of the report. Senator Feinstein gives a speech summarizing the report and its implications, and then SenatorJohn McCain, who was tortured by his captors as aprisoner of warduring theVietnam War, gives an impassioned speech in support of the report.
An epilogue, delivered through a series ofintertitles, explains that Jones left his job as a Senate staffer after the summary of the report was released. It is also noted that no CIA officers were ever criminally charged in connection with the actions outlined in the report, that many were in fact promoted, and that one (an allusion toGina Haspel) later became director of the agency.
The film was announced in April 2018, withScott Z. Burnsdirecting and writing, andAdam Driver,Annette Bening,Jon Hamm, andJennifer Morrisonsigned on to star.[15][16]
When asked byPBS NewsHour'sJeffrey Brownabout his motivation for making a film inspired by the controversial 2014Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture, Burns replied that both of his parents are psychologists, and he found it "appalling" to learn from the report[17]that "people had figured out a way to weaponize psychology," a profession that "exists to help people."[18]Burns further said that he and producerSteven Soderberghfelt it reflected well on the United States that the government allowed the summary of the report to be published. In the same interview, Soderbergh said he did not know "that there's another country, other than maybe Canada or the UK," that "would have even allowed this kind of investigation."[18]
Some of the characters that appear in the film arecomposite characters, such as Bernadette, who bears some resemblance toGina Haspel. Haspel oversaw theCIA black sitein Thailand whereAbu Zubaydahwas tortured, and later managed to push her bosses to destroy the tapes of the torture. According to the CIA, Haspel was not, however, in charge of the site during Zubaydah's interrogation.[19]
Production began on April 16, 2018, inNew York.[20]Tim Blake Nelson,Ben McKenzie,Matthew Rhys,Ted Levine, andMichael C. Hallwere added to the cast the following month,[21]andMaura Tierneyjoined the cast in June.[22]The film's fifty-day shooting schedule and $18 million budget were cut to twenty-six days and $8 million.[1]
The Reporthad its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 26, 2019,[23]andAmazon Studiosacquired its distribution rights shortly thereafter for $14 million.[24]In October, it appeared as a spotlight film at theHamptons International Film Festival.[25]In the United States, the film was scheduled for a theatrical release on September 27, 2019, two weeks before itsstreamingrelease onAmazon Prime Videoon October 11,[26]but those dates were changed to November 15 and November 29, respectively.[27]
Unlike with its previous titles, Amazon did not publicly discloseThe Report's theatrical grosses, butIndieWireestimated that it grossed around $150,000 from 84 theaters over its opening weekend. The site wrote that "the response, so far as we can determine, are  [sic] under the usual Amazon performance."[28]Playing in just 60 theaters the following weekend, the film made an estimated $75,000.[2]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 83% of 244 critics' reviews of the film are positive, with an average rating of 7.2/10; the site's "critics consensus" reads: "The Reportdraws on a dark chapter in American history to offer a sober, gripping account of one public servant's crusade for accountability."[29]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted averagescore of 66 out of 100 based on reviews by 33 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[30]Certain critics compared the film topolitical thrillersfrom the 1970s, in contrast to more recent works. For instance,Owen GleibermanofVarietysaid he foundThe Report"at once gripping and eye-opening" in a way that made him think ofAll the President's Men(1976).[31]
Human Rights Firstawarded the 2019 Sidney Lumet Award for Integrity in Entertainment toThe Report.[32]In 2020, the film won theCinema for Peace Awardfor Political Film of the Year.

In a March 2020 interview, Burns commented on the film's resurgence and similarities to the active pandemic, especially in the wake of a round ofCDCbudget cuts:
"I was terrified. Every scientist who I spoke to when I worked on the movie said that exact same thing to me: It's not a matter of 'if,' it's a matter of 'when.' You can decide that most of the time, firemen are just sitting around. But it's very hard to start a fire department once your house is on fire. And so the notion that we're going to cut these things and we'll just try to rebuild them when we need them is foolish and dangerous. I was very aware that ourDepartment of Homeland Securityhad a pandemic team standing by because this is a real threat. The fact that this administration decided to do away with that puts all of us at risk."
