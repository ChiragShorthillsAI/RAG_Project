Cold Pursuitis a 2019action thriller film[7][8][9]directed byHans Petter Molandfrom a screenplay by Frank Baldwin. An international co-production, the film starsLiam Neeson,Tom Bateman,Tom Jackson,Emmy Rossum,Domenick Lombardozzi,Julia Jones,John Doman, andLaura Dern.  It is a remake of the 2014 Norwegian filmIn Order of Disappearance(Kraftidioten), also directed by Moland, and follows a vengefulsnowplowdriver (Neeson) who starts killing the members of a drug cartel following the murder of his son.
The film was released in the United States on February 8, 2019, byLionsgateandSummit Entertainment. It grossed $76 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.[10]
After being awardedCitizen of the Yearby theski resortof Kehoe,Colorado,snowplowdriver Nels Coxman's life is disrupted when his son dies from a forcedheroinoverdose, murdered by aDenverdrug cartel. Nels makes asawed-off rifle, and kills three members of the cartel, Speedo, Limbo, and Santa, dumping their bodies over a nearby waterfall. Nels's wife Grace (angry at his seemingly cold lack of grief) leaves him.
The cartel'sdrug lord, Trevor "Viking" Calcote, first suspects that these deaths are the work of his rival White Bull, aUtewith whom he has avoided conflict. Viking has one of Bull's gangsters murdered, not knowing it is White Bull's only son. This drives White Bull to seek vengeance, and he orders his men to kidnap Viking's young son Ryan in retaliation, which starts a gang war. Nels's brother Brock, once amob enforcerknown as Wingman, tells Nels that killing Viking requires a hired assassin, and recommends a hitman known as "The Eskimo". The Eskimo agrees to kill Viking for Nels'US$90,000 but decides he can get anotherUS$90,000 from Viking by informing him that Coxman has hired him for the hit.
Viking does not appreciate the Eskimo's "lack of professional ethics" and kills him. He thinks the Eskimo meant Brock Coxman and takes Brock in his car. Since Brock is dying ofcancer, he claims responsibility for the hits to protect his brother. Viking tries in vain to stop the war by using one of his own men (Dexter) as ascapegoatand sending White Bull the man's head. This is insufficient to placate White Bull, who shoots the messenger, Sly. Meanwhile, Nels kidnaps Ryan from hisprep schoolbefore White Bull's men can do so to draw Viking into an ambush. Nels treats the boy well and protects him from the violence to come. Nels' identity is revealed to Viking by the school's janitor. Though promisedUS$10,000 for the tip, he too is killed after his disclosure.
Nels calls Viking and tells him to come to his house alone. When Viking says it will take him three hours, Nels takes Ryan with him to work. While Viking was lying, as he already knew Nels' address and was minutes away, he finds the house empty; his men toss the place to find clues about the kidnapper. While teaching Ryan how to drive the snow equipment, Nels meets Officers Dash and Gip on the road and says Ryan is his visiting nephew. The police then comment that they saw the cars at his place. Nels realizes Viking and his men are already on his trail and leaves with Ryan. Viking's men find out where Nels works and leave. Mustang, who has stayed behind at Nels's home and has been grieving over Dexter's senseless death, tips off the Ute that Viking was responsible for the death of White Bull's son and where he can be found.
Nels hides Ryan in a safe place knowing that Viking and his men are coming. Nels is eventually ambushed and taken to Viking. Viking instructs them to take Nels to the garage to begin torturing him to find out where his son is but the Ute arrive. During the ensuing shootout, most of both groups are killed. Viking, attempting to drive away, is trapped when Nels uses machinery to impale Viking's car with a shorn tree trunk, allowing White Bull to shoot Viking in the chest. He dies when found by Kehoe patrol officers Kimberly Dash and Gip. Dash spots Ryan driving an industrial snow blower in the direction of Kehoe, but chooses not to follow, instead calling it into dispatch. As Nels leaves in his snowplow to continue his work, White Bull jumps into the cab; after initially holding Nels at gunpoint, the two men drive away together with both being satisfied for having avenged their respective children's deaths. Avalanche, one of White Bull's men, who had goneparaglidingearlier, accidentally flies into the snowplow, being minced to death and shredded to bits.

Chris Nashawaty, writing forEntertainment Weekly, delivered a positive review, grading it a "B+":
If [Cold Pursuit] sounds like murder-by-numbers Liam NeesonMad Libs, well, it kind of is. But what setsCold Pursuitapart from its predecessors is its tone. It has the jokey, self-amused vibe of anElmore Leonardnovel or one of those arch, wannabeTarantinoknock-offs that sprouted up like toadstools in the wake ofReservoir DogsandPulp Fictionand were quickly forgotten. It knows exactly what kind of movie it is, but that doesn't stand in the way of it goosing its bloodbath set pieces with irreverent, off-kilter gallows humor.[37]
Richard Roeper, writing for theChicago Sun-Times, praised the film, awarding it 3.5 out of 4 stars:
As characters with nicknames such as Sly and Mustang and Smoke and War Dog and Shiv and Drayno enter and often quickly exit the picture,Cold Pursuitmoves forward with the assured and deliberate force of Nels' massive snowplow. And with Neeson/Nels at the wheel,Cold Pursuitis one fantastically hot mess of a movie.[38]
Cold Pursuitwas nominated forBest Action or Adventure Filmat the45th Saturn Awards, losing toMission: Impossible – Fallout.[citation needed]
Liam Neeson was accused of racism after an interview withThe Independentat apress junketfor the film, published in February 2019.[39][40]Neeson explained his character's "primal" anger to the interviewer by recounting an experience he had many years ago. A woman close to him said she had been raped by a stranger, and Neeson asked what color skin the attacker had; after learning the attacker was black, Neeson said that for about a week, he "went up and down areas with acosh... hoping some 'black bastard' would come out of a pub and have a go" so that Neeson "could kill him". In the interview, Neeson also said he was "ashamed" to recount the experience and that it was "horrible" that he did what he did. "It's awful ... but I did learn a lesson from it, when I eventually thought, 'What the fuck are you doing?'"[41][42]
In an appearance onGood Morning America, Neeson elaborated on his experience while denying being a racist, saying the incident occurred nearly 40 years ago, that he asked for physical attributes of the rapist other than race, that he would have done the same if the rapist was "a Scot or a Brit or a Lithuanian", that he had purposely gone into "black areas of the city", and that he "did seek help" from a priest after coming to his senses. Neeson said that the lesson of his experience was "to open up, to talk about these things", as there was still underlying "racism and bigotry" in both the United States and Northern Ireland. The controversy of Neeson's comments led to the cancellation of the red-carpet event for the premiere of the film.[43][44][45]

In 1991 it bought a five percent stake in the independent American studioCarolco Pictures.[2]However, in 1992, Le Studio Canal+ suffered financial difficulties afterCarolco Picturesentered a corporate restructure.[citation needed]
