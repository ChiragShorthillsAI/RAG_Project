Official Secretsis a 2019 Britishdrama filmdirected byGavin Hood, based on the case ofwhistleblowerKatharine Gun, who exposed an illegal spying operation by American and British intelligence services to gauge sentiment of and potentially blackmailUnited Nations diplomats tasked to voteon a resolution regarding the2003 invasion of Iraq.[3][4]Keira Knightleystars as Gun, alongsideMatt Smith,Matthew Goode,Adam Bakri,Indira VarmaandRalph Fiennes.
The film had its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon 28 January 2019 and was released in the United States on 30 August 2019, byIFC Films, and in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2019, byEntertainment One.
In early 2003,GCHQanalystKatharine Gunobtains a memo detailing a joint United States and British operation to spy on diplomats from several non–permanentUnited Nations Security Councilmember states (Cameroon,Chile,BulgariaandGuinea), to "dig dirt" on them. This was to influence the Security Council into passing a resolution supporting aninvasionofIraq.
Angered that theUKis being led into a war on false pretences, Katharine leaks the memo to a friend involved in theanti-war movement, who passes it to anti-war activistYvonne Ridley. She gets it toThe ObserverjournalistMartin Bright.
The Observerforeign editorPeter Beaumontallows Martin to investigate the story. To verify the memo's authenticity, Martin enlists the help of theObserver's Washington correspondentEd Vulliamyto contact the memo's author Frank Koza, Chief of Staff at the "regional targets" section of theNSA. Despite theObserver'spro-war stance, Peter convinces the chief editorRoger Altonthat the leaked memo is worth publishing.
The leaked memo's publication in March 2003 generates public and media interest. TheDrudge Reportattempts to discredit the document as a fake, as staffer Nicole Mowbray had inadvertently changed the text from American to British English with a spellchecker. However, Martin is able to produce the original memo, confirming its authenticity.
Katharine's actions prompt GCHQ to launch an internal investigation. Seeking to prevent an invasion of Iraq and to protect her colleagues from suspicion, Katharine confesses to leaking the memo. She is arrested and detained, before being releasedon bail.
Following the outbreak of the Iraq War, Katharine seeks the services of theLibertylawyersBen EmmersonandShami Chakrabarti. The British Government decides to charge her with violating theOfficial Secrets Act, taskingDirector of Public ProsecutionsKen Macdonaldwith the prosecution.
To exert pressure, the British authorities attempt to deport her husband Yasar Gun, aTurkish Kurd. However, Katharine is able to halt the deportation by presenting their marriage certificate, proving the relationship's authenticity.
The defence strategy is that Katharine was acting out of loyalty to her country by seeking to prevent the UK from being led into an unlawful war. With the help of Martin, Ed, and formerForeign Officedeputy legal adviserElizabeth Wilmshurst, Ben discovers that theAttorney GeneralPeter Goldsmithchanged his position on the legality of the war after meeting several lawyers from theBush Administration. Despite the odds against them, Katharine refuses to plead guilty in exchange for a reduced charge.
At the trial, the Crown prosecutor drops all charges against Katharine. Ben suggests to the court that this is because prosecuting her would have shown that theBlair governmentled the UK into war on false pretences.
The film then mentions the human toll of the Iraq War and that Lord Goldsmith's advice on the illegality of the Iraq War was made public in 2010. It ends with footage of Katharine addressing the media following the dismissal of her case, and Ben shunning Ken for putting Katharine through the ordeal "to make an example of her".
Sara and Gregory Bernstein had already written a script by 2008. Eventually it found itself onThe Black List, a list of "most liked" screenplays that have not yet been produced, where director Debs Paterson saw it.[6]Still, nothing came of it until January 2016, when a filming start in May was announced, withHarrison Ford,Anthony Hopkins,Paul Bettany,Natalie DormerandMartin Freemancast.[7]Tahar RahimandGillian Andersonwere cast during the 2016Berlin International Film Festival.[8][9]However by June 2017, filming had yet to begin, and cast member Anderson stated she had not heard anything about the project since being cast.[10]
By January 2018, the project was redeveloped once more, withGavin Hoodnow set to direct in place ofJustin Chadwick, andKeira KnightleyandMatt Smithcast in February, replacing the previous cast. In March,Ralph FiennesandMatthew Goodejoined the cast, with filming beginning on 12 March 2018 inYorkshire.[11][12][13][14]Filming took place in the village ofBoston Spaon 14 March.[15]Indira Varma,Conleth HillandTamsin Greigjoined the cast the next day.[16]Filming had moved toManchesterby 19 March, serving as a stand-in forLondon.[17]Filming was undertaken in April 2018 in Liverpool'sSt George's Hall.[18]The beach scenes for the character played by Ralph Fiennes is atThurstastonbeach on theDee EstuaryofWirral peninsulaand prominently shows the cottage known locally as Sally's Cottage.

Onreview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 166 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10.

In an article about the film andKatharine Gun,Sam Husseiniwrote that "having followed this story from the start, I find this film to be, by Hollywood standards, a remarkably accurate account of what has happened to date—'to date' because the wider story still isn't really over".[26]

Hood attendedSt Stithians Collegeand went on to graduate with a law degree from theUniversity of the Witwatersrand.[1]He then pursued a post-graduate degree in screenwriting and directing at a film school in California in 1991.[2]
Upon returning to his home country, Hood got his start in directing when he was commissioned to make several shorteducationaldramasfor theSouth African Department of Health. His first commercialshort filmwasThe Storekeeper(1998). He earned an Artes Award for his contributions.[2]
Hood co-produced and wrote the script for his debutfeature film,A Reasonable Man(1999), which portrays the accidental killing of a young child mistaken for atokoloshe.

Prior to the film's release, Gavin talked about thepoliticalundertones of the newWolverinemovie:
Any movie that is simply about good versus evil ... is in my view putting out into the world and certainly into a mass audience and young audience's mind a rather dangerous philosophy, which is that there is good and evil in the simplistic and easily defined way
...
I think that for the last eight years, we've had that philosophy very much prevalent in the Bush administration that if you're on the side of good, at least as you perceive it, then you can do no evil ... That's what's so great about this character or about this movie for me and why I wanted to do it ... This is a guy who recognizes his own capacity for evil and I think that's exciting in a sort of popular culture kind of way. After all, the most famous line from Wolverine, the comics, is "I am the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice."[7]

Keira Christina Knightley was born on 26 March 1985 in the London suburb ofTeddington, to stage actorsWill KnightleyandSharman Macdonald.[2]She was meant to be named "Kiera", the anglicised form of "Kira", after the Soviet figure skaterKira Ivanova, whom her father admired; however, Macdonald misspelt the name when she registered her daughter's birth certificate, writing theebefore thei.[3]Her father isEnglishand her mother is ofScottishandWelshdescent.[4]Knightley has an older brother, Caleb.[5]Macdonald worked as a playwright after her acting career came to an end. Knightley's parents encountered substantial financial difficulties following the birth of her brother;[6]her father, a "middling" actor, agreed to a second child only if her mother sold a script first. However, her parents' varying degrees of success did not deter Knightley's curiosity about the profession.[7]Macdonald introduced her own children to theatre and ballet very early.[8]This inspired Knightley's interest in acting.[9]
Knightley attendedTeddington School.[10]She was diagnosed withdyslexiaat age six, but by the time she was eleven, with her parents' support, she says, "they deemed me to have got over it sufficiently". She is still a slow reader and cannot read out loud.[11]Knightley has said she was "single-minded about acting".[12]At age three, she requested to obtain an agent like her parents and secured one at six. This led to her taking a number of small parts in television dramas.[13]She acted in a number of local amateur productions, which includedAfter Juliet, written by her mother, andUnited States, written by her drama teacher. Knightley began studying herA-LevelsatEsher College, but left after a year to pursue an acting career.[14]Her mother's friends encouraged her to go to drama school, which she declined for financial and professional reasons.[15]
After obtaining an agent at age six, Knightley began working in commercials and small television roles. Her first onscreen appearance was in the 1993Screen Onetelevision episode titled "Royal Celebration". She then played Natasha Jordan, a young girl whose mother is involved in an extramarital affair, in the romantic dramaA Village Affair(1995). After appearing in a spate of television films through the mid-to-late 1990s, includingInnocent Lies(1995),The Treasure Seekers(1996),Coming Home(1998), andOliver Twist(1999),[16]Knightley landed the role ofSabé,Padmé Amidala'shandmaidenanddecoy, in the 1999 science fiction blockbusterStar Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. Her dialogue was dubbed over byNatalie Portman, who played Padmé. Knightley was cast in the role because of her close resemblance to Portman; even the two actresses' mothers had difficulty telling their daughters apart when they were in full make-up.[17]
In her first major role, the 2001Walt Disney Productionstelevision filmPrincess of Thieves, Knightley played the daughter ofRobin Hood. In preparation for the part, she trained for several weeks in archery, fencing, and riding.[18]Concurrently, she appeared inThe Hole, a thriller that received a direct-to-video release in the US. The film's directorNick Hammdescribed her as "a young version ofJulie Christie".[19]Knightley also took on the role of Lara Antipova in the 2002 miniseries adaptation ofDoctor Zhivago, to positive reviews and high ratings.[20]In the same year, Knightley starred as a pregnant drug addict inGillies MacKinnon's drama filmPure. Co-starringMolly ParkerandHarry Eden, the film had its world premiere at the2002 Toronto International Film Festival.[21]In a retrospect review for AboutFilm.com, Carlo Cavagna noted Knightley's screen presence and wrote that "[although Knightley] doesn't have half of Parker's ability [...] she has spunk and grit [and] shines brightly inPure".[22]
Knightley landed a breakthrough role when she starred inGurinder Chadha's sports comedy filmBend It Like Beckham, which was a box office hit in the U.K and U.S.[23]Knightley portrayed Jules, atomboyfootball player struggling against social norms who convinces her friend to pursue the sport.[24]The film surprised critics who were laudatory of its "charming" and "inspiring" nature, social context and the cast's performances.[25]Knightley and her co-starParminder Nagraattracted international attention for their performances;[26]criticJames Berardinelli, who was largely laudatory of the film and the "energetic and likable" cast, noted that Knightley and Nagra brought "a lot of spirit to their instantly likable characters".[27]To prepare for their roles, they underwent three months of extensive football training under the English football coachSimon Clifford. Knightley was initially sceptical of the project: in an interview withTracy Smithshe said, "I remember telling friends I was doing this girls' soccer movie [...] And nobody thought that it was gonna be any good."[28]
Knightley was cast asElizabeth Swannin the 2003 American fantasyswashbuckler filmPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.[29]The film, based on theDisney theme park attraction, revolves around infamous buccaneerJack Sparrowand blacksmithWill Turnerrescuing Swann, in possession of a cursed golden medallion, from 18th-century pirates.[30]The producersJerry BruckheimerandGore Verbinskicast Knightley for her "indescribable quality [...] reminiscent of motion picture stars from Hollywood's heyday."[31]Knightley underestimated the stunt work required and believed she would primarily be sitting in carriages; at one point during filming, she stood for two days on a plank and rejected a stunt double's offer to jump off the platform for the scene.[31][32]Despite boasting the names of stars likeJohnny DeppandOrlando Bloomand a $135 million budget,Pirateswas expected to fail at the box office.[33]Knightley herself was not optimistic about its prospects.[34]The film opened at number one on the box office, and became one of the highest-grossing releases of the year, with worldwide revenues of $654 million.[35]Elvis MitchellofThe New York Timeslikened Knightley's "strident and confident" physical assurance to that ofNicole Kidman, while Keith Phipps ofThe A.V. Clubdescribed her and Bloom as appealing leads.[36][37]
Also in 2003, Knightley appeared inRichard Curtis's Christmas-themed romantic comedyLove Actually, featuring an ensemble cast, which included her childhood idolEmma Thompson.[38][39]Knightley played Juliet, a woman whose fiancée's best man is secretly in love with her.[40]Peter Travers ofRolling Stonecriticised the waste of Knightley's talent in a "nothing" role,[41]while Megan Conner ofThe Guardianremarked that the film turned Knightley into a household name.[15]Love Actuallyhas been referred to as a modern-day Christmas classic.[42]Knightley believes the film's trajectory to be "extraordinary", given that its popularity resurfaced a few years after the film's release.[43]Knightley's only release of 2004 was the historical filmKing Arthur, where she playedGuinevere, a warrior queen and the wife of thetitular character.[44]The part required her to learn boxing, archery, and riding.[38][45]The criticA. O. Scottpraised Knightley for "throw[ing] herself bodily into every scene".[46]Although the film received unfavourable reviews, Knightley's stature as a performer grew; she was voted by the readers ofHellomagazine as the industry's most promising teen star,[47]and featured inTimemagazine's article, which stated that she seemed dedicated to develop herself as a serious actor rather than a film star.[48]
Knightley appeared in three films in 2005, the first of which was the psychological thrillerThe Jacket, co-starringAdrien Brody.[49]In a mixed review forEmpire, Kim Newman wrote that the role was unlike the ones she had previously taken up : "getting out of period gear and talking American, tries to broaden her range and is arguably well-cast".[50]Knightley next played the titular character inTony Scott's French-American action filmDomino, based on the life ofDomino Harvey. The film's release was delayed on several occasions and, on its eventual release in November, it received negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office.[51]
Knightley's most successful release of the year wasPride & Prejudice, a period drama based onJane Austen's novelPride and Prejudice.[52]The directorJoe Wrightcast Knightley for her tomboyish nature combined with a "lively mind" and sense of humour.[53]Knightley, who had admired the book from a young age,[54]said of her character, "The beauty ofElizabethis that every woman who ever reads the book seems to recognise herself, with all her faults and imperfections."[54]On release, the film became a huge commercial success, with total collections of around US$120million worldwide, and received positive reviews from critics.[55]Writing forThe Guardian, Peter Bradshaw labelled her performance of "beauty, delicacy, spirit and wit; in her growing lustre and confidence" and Derek Elley ofVarietyfound her "luminous strength" to be reminiscent of a youngAudrey Hepburn.[56][57]Knightley earned "Best Actress in a Leading Role" nominations at theGolden Globesand theAcademy Awardsfor her performance at age 20, becoming thethird-youngestnominee for the latter.[58]Knightley's consecutive successes came with increased media scrutiny, and she later admitted to experiencing struggles with her mental health during this period.[59]
Knightley was invited to join theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, among other artists in 2006.[60]In 2004, the second and third films of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries were conceived, with screenwritersTed ElliottandTerry Rossiodeveloping a story arc that would span both sequels, in which Knightley reprised her role as Elizabeth Swann. The plot of the films see Swann buck convention to seek adventure and become fierce pirate and fighter to match the skills of Sparrow and her love interest, Turner.[61]The sequel installments allowed Knightley to study sword-fighting, which she had sought to do since the first film.[31]Filming for the projects took place in 2005;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestreleased in July 2006, with the worldwide collections of $1.066 billion, becoming the biggest financial hit of Knightley's career.[62]The third installment in the series,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, was released in May, the following year.[63]A. O Scott termed her performance "a vision of imperial British pluckiness, with an intriguing dash of romantic recklessness that surfaces toward the end".[64]In November 2006, it was reported that Knightley didn't want to participate in any further sequels.[65]By 2010, both Knightley and Orlando Bloom had repeatedly been quoted in saying they wanted to move on.[66][67][68]
Knightley's continued association with period dramas yielded varying results, as seen with two of her 2007 releases,François Girard'sSilk, andJoe Wright'sAtonement, the feature film adaptations of the novels byAlessandro BariccoandIan McEwanrespectively.[69]The former project failed at the box office, while the latter became a critical and commercial success. Knightley played Cecilia Tallis, the elder of the twoTallis sisters, who struggles with a wartime romance with her love interest, played byJames McAvoy.[70]She admitted that the pacing on the smaller, more intimate film was an adjustment compared to thePiratesfranchise.[71]In preparing for the film, Knightley studiedthe novelas well as the "naturalism" of the performance as seen in films from the 1930s and 1940s, such asIn Which We Serve(1942) andBrief Encounter(1945).[72][71]She admired the multi-layered and "fascinating" nature of her character's behaviour.[73]Knightley's performance won theEmpire Award for Best Actress,[74]and earned her nominations for theBAFTAand theGolden Globes awards, also in the leading actress categories.[75]The criticRichard Roeper, who thought the lead duo were "superb" in their respective roles, was puzzled by their failure to receive Academy Award nominations.[76]Thegreen dressworn by Knightley during the film's climactic scene garnered substantive press attention, and was subsequently regarded as one of the greatest costumes in film history.[77][78][79]
Knightley appeared alongsideSienna Miller,Cillian Murphy, andMatthew RhysinJohn Maybury's 2008 wartime dramaThe Edge of Love. The film had her play the role of Vera Phillips, a childhood friend of Welsh poetDylan Thomasand his wifeCaitlin Macnamara. Knightley wrote the script with her mother,Sharman Macdonald, with Macnamara in mind.[80]After Knightley signed on, her character's role was increased with the film focusing on her romance with a British soldier.[80]Knightley connected to Vera's quietness, and described her as "tragic and beautiful".[80]She based her performance onMarlene Dietrich, and was to mime to her prerecorded voice, before being told by Maybury to sing live. Knightley initially felt embarrassed to do so, saying she "[shook] like a leaf" but eventually went through with the plan.[80]Upon release, the film became a moderate critical and commercial success.[81]Knightley's performance and singing abilities were praised;The Independentnoted that Knightley "gives Vera an independence and complexity that's aeons ahead", while theLos Angeles Timeswrote "the film belongs to the women, with Knightley going from strength to strength (and showing she can sing!)".[82]
Knightley then starred as the 18th-centuryEnglish aristocratGeorgiana Cavendish, Duchess of DevonshireinSaul Dibb's period dramaThe Duchess(2008), based on the best-selling biographical novel,Georgiana, Duchess of DevonshirebyAmanda Foreman.[83]The film tells the story of Georgiana's rise in society as a sociopolitical tastemaker after her marriage disintegrates.[84]The script Knightley was sent was covered in "huge white ostrich feathers" and a gold ribbon.[85]Gabrielle Tana, the film's producer, stated Knightley "brought an instinctive understanding" of such aspects of Georgiana's life as a celebrity from her own experiences.[86]Knightley was attracted to her character's strength and status as a political influence and fashion prowess, while being inwardly vulnerable and isolated.[85]Simon Crooke ofEmpiredescribed her performance as "an enigmatic, free-spirited turn and a role she'll be remembered for, probably her best role to date in a film not directed byJoe Wright."[87]The following year, she was nominated for aBritish Independent Film Award for Best Actress.[88]A film adaptation ofWilliam Shakespeare's tragedyKing Learset to star Knightley andAnthony Hopkinswas cancelled due torecession.[89]
Knightley made herWest Enddebut withMartin Crimp's version ofMolière's comedyThe Misanthrope. Starring Knightley,Damian Lewis,Tara Fitzgerald, andDominic Rowan, the play was staged at theComedy Theatrein December 2009. She portrayed Jennifer, a shallow, amorous, and vulnerable American film star who is courted by an analytical and veracious playwright.[90]Knightley chose the role as she felt that "if I don't do theatre right now, I think I'm going to start being too terrified to do it" and described the production as an "extraordinary and incredibly fulfilling" experience, she was sceptical of her performance.[91]Paul Taylor ofThe Independentremarked that Knightley was "not only strikingly convincing, but, at times, rather thrilling in its satiric aplomb".[92]However,The Guardian's Michael Billington noted that due to the nature of the role, "one could say that she is not unduly stretched".[93]In recognition of her theatre debut, Knightley was nominated for theLaurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Roleand anEvening StandardAward.[94]
Knightley began the new decade with three films; she remarked that her work during this period helped her "empathise with people or with situations that I don't necessarily find it easy to empathise with".[95]Two of the productions,Massy Tadjedin's romantic dramaLast NightandWilliam Monahan's crime noir filmLondon Boulevardopened to mixed responses from critics and rank among the lowest-grossing films in Knightley's career.[96][62]Knightley's other release,Never Let Me Go, an adaptation ofKazuo Ishiguro'snovel of the same namefared better at the box office and received positive reviews. Knightley described the script as unique, one that made the reader think.[95]Co-starringAndrew GarfieldandCarey Mulligan, Knightley played Ruth, one of three graduates of an autocratic boarding school that discovers their fates in adystopia.[97][98]She appeared in avideo installationby artistStuart Pearson WrighttitledMaze.[99]
