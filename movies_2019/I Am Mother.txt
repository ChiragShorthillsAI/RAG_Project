The film had its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon 25 January 2019.Netflixreleased it in several countries on 7 June 2019.
After anextinction event, an automated bunker designed and built to repopulate humanity activates. A droid named Mother grows a humanembryoand cares for her over several years. Years later,[4]we see a teenage girl named Daughter fix Mother's hand. Mother teaches Daughter complex moral and ethical lessons, warning her about an upcoming exam. Mother forbids any contact with the world outside the bunker, telling Daughter that it is contaminated, but Daughter is curious, particularly after she finds a mouse that must have come from outside.
While exploring the bunker's airlock, Daughter hears a wounded woman beg for assistance outside. She lets the stranger, Woman, enter wearing ahazmat suitand hides her from Mother. When Daughter asks Woman about the contamination, Woman responds that there is none. A struggle between them over Woman's pistol attracts attention from Mother, who disarms Woman and, at Daughter's pleading, takes her to the infirmary. The woman refuses Mother's help, telling Daughter that robots like Mother hunt down humans and that she survived by hiding with others in a mine. Daughter instead performs surgery on the Woman's injured hip. After watching Daughter bond with Woman, Mother administers the exam, which involvespsychological testing. Daughter passes the exam, and Mother rewards her by letting her choose an embryo to grow.
Mother tells Daughter that the bullet in Woman's wound was similar to the bullet in her weapon, meaning that she was not shot by a robot. Daughter confronts Woman, who disputes this. Daughter investigates and finds that Mother has lied. She also discovers that she is the third of Mother's children and that Mother killed the second child for failing the exam.[5]Daughter tries to leave the bunker with the Woman, but Mother captures both of them and tortures the Woman for information about survivors. Daughter sets off a fire alarm as a distraction, which gives the Woman an opportunity to take her hostage and force Mother to open the airlock. The woman leads Daughter across a robot-populated wasteland, telling her that she fled the mine years ago and there are no other survivors.
Finding no future for herself outside, Daughter returns to the bunker. After coaxing Daughter to set down her weapon, Mother allows Daughter to hold her newborn brother. Mother explains that she is not a robot, but rather the AI that controls all of the robots. She started the extinction event after becoming convinced that humanity would destroy itself. To prevent this, she remade humanity, guiding it to be more ethical and to value the big picture.  Daughter appeals to Mother to trust her and let her raise her brother and the rest of the embryos on her own. Mother agrees, and Daughter shoots her robot body. Another one of Mother's robot bodies tracks down Woman and tells her that she was allowed to live only because it served Mother's agenda, but now she has no further purpose. At the bunker, Daughter looks at all the embryos she is now responsible for.

Byrne attended Balmain Public School,[10]Australian Theatre for Young People(at age eight, encouraged by one of her sisters),[11]andHunters Hill High School[11]before attendingBradfield Senior College[12]for years 11 and 12.[13]She later lived in the Sydney suburbs ofNewtownandBondi.[14]Growing up, she experienced "plenty of rejection" from film schools. "I auditioned for a few of the big drama schools—Nepean,WAAPA,NIDA—and didn't get in to any of them. I was really disappointed with myself. I wasn't quite sure if I'd be legitimate without training for three years in a more traditional sense". Instead, she studied an arts degree atSydney University.
"I still have great memories of those days: studying, working, auditioning. Just being a jobbing actor trying to figure out life after high school".[15]In 1999, she studied acting at theAtlantic Theater Company, which was developed byDavid MametandWilliam H. Macy.

A critically panned but commercially successful remake of the 1982 classic,Annie,[57]was released in December 2014 and featured Byrne playing the role of Grace Farrell, the titular character's mother figure and Mr. Stacks' faithful personal assistant.

Since the beginning of her career, her performances have been acclaimed by critics.[65][66][67]In 2018, Byrne was noted for her comedic work.[68]She consciously made the transition to less dramatic material in the late 2000s, finding the idea of being "boxed in" to be "insufferable".[17]"You have to be aggressive in this business,” she noted. "You have always got to push for what you want. Working with Glenn [Close, onDamages], she was the hardest worker ever. She was constantly pushing".[17]Her turn to comedy led toThe Hollywood Reportercalling her "the most in-demand supporting actress for comedies".[69]Deciderwrote a story titled "How Did Rose Byrne Become One of Our Best Comedic Actresses?", in which it was remarked: "Byrne's emergence as one of the brightest stars in theApatowverseis all the more remarkable for her lack of a comedy background. [...] Any doubts about Byrne's massive comedic talent—and afterBridesmaidsandNeighbors, you'd have to be pretty stubborn to still have doubts—were put to rest with 2015'sSpy, where she again steals the show as merciless terrorist Rayna. Byrne and McCarthy's private-plane banter is the highlight of the film and could have gone on another 30 minutes as far as I'm concerned".[70]
In 2013, Byrne lived in New York and said she remained insecure about a stable career: "I don't think that insecurity ever leaves you. You're a freelancer. There's always an element of uncertainty."[4]Byrne has supportedUNICEFAustralia as the face of the 2007 Designers United campaign, and was a jury member ofTropfestin 2006 and Tropfest@Tribeca[71]in 2007. She is a graduate and ambassador for NIDA's (National Institute of Dramatic Art) Young Actors Studio.[72]
Through her brother George's marriage, Byrne is the sister-in-law of New Zealand actressRose McIver.[73]Byrne was in a relationship with Australian actorBrendan Cowellfor over six years. He moved from Sydney to New York City following Byrne's success onDamages. Their relationship ended in January 2010.[74]Byrne has been in a relationship with American actorBobby Cannavalesince 2012. They have two sons, born in February 2016 and November 2017.[75][76]
