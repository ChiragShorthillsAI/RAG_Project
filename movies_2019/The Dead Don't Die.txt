The Dead Don't Dieis a 2019 Americanabsurdistzombie comedyandmetacinematicfilm written and directed byJim Jarmusch. It features anensemble castincludingBill Murray,Adam Driver,Chloë Sevigny,Steve Buscemi,Tilda Swinton,Tom Waits,Danny Glover,Caleb Landry Jones,Rosie Perez,Iggy Pop,Carol Kane,RZA,Austin Butler, andSelena Gomezand follows a small town's police force as they combat a sudden zombie invasion.
The film had its world premiere as the opening film at theCannes Film Festivalon May 14, 2019. It was theatrically released in North America on June 14, 2019 byFocus Features, and earned $15.3 million at the box office. It received mixed reviews from critics.
In rural Centerville, police Chief Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray) and officer Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) respond to a report from farmer Frank Miller (Steve Buscemi) regarding a missing chicken. They briefly interact with Hermit Bob (Tom Waits), a bearded eccentric, in the woods. On their way back to the station, Cliff notices there is still daylight after 8 p.m. and Ronnie's watch and cell phone stop working. Later, at a diner, hardware store owner Hank Thompson (Danny Glover) hears a radio report concerning polar fracking.
Two corpses reanimate when night falls and kill the two diner employees, who are discovered by Hank the next morning. Ronnie believes zombies killed the employees. Young travelers Zoe (Selena Gomez), Jack (Austin Butler), and Zack (Luka Sabbat) stop for gas and meet Bobby (Caleb Landry Jones).
At the Centerville Juvenile Detention Center, inmate Geronimo tells fellow inmates Olivia and Stella that polar fracking has altered the Earth's rotation.
Cliff and Ronnie find open graves at the cemetery, while Hermit Bob spies on them. Cliff emphatically rejects Ronnie's suggestion of informing Farmer Miller of the general suspicion that zombies are on the loose. Ronnie teaches Cliff how to kill zombies, and Bobby and Hank prepare weapons. Motel owner Danny Perkins watches news about pets behaving strangely and then finds out his cats are missing. Other of Farmer Miller's animals have disappeared.
That evening, more zombies rise, and Danny is attacked and transformed. Cliff and Ronnie bring supplies to the station and tell fellow officer Mindy Morrison (Chloe Sevigny) about the zombies. The corpse of Mallory (Carol Kane), a local alcoholic, reanimates in the police station and Ronnie decapitates her.
Two corpses reanimate at the funeral home and are beheaded by Zelda Winston (Tilda Swinton), who recently bought the funeral home, with a sword. She goes to the police station, where the three officers leave her to operate communications. The cops drive through town and find the three travelers dead at the motel. Ronnie beheads the bodies, much to Mindy's distress, and takes Zoe'sSturgill SimpsonCD. Zelda waves her hand over the police computer and it generates code. Ronnie begins playing the CD on the police car sound system, but Cliff throws the CD out the car window.
Hank and Bobby face zombies at the hardware store. Each zombie says only one word, related to something from their past or an item they see as a zombie. Zombies maul Farmer Miller. Inmates Geronimo, Olivia and Stella flee the detention center, again observed by Hermit Bob. When zombies overwhelm the patrol car at the cemetery, Officer Mindy sees her dead grandmother, and exits the car, only to be engulfed by zombies. Ronnie and Cliff tell each other to shut up. Ronnie says he knew all would end badly becauseJimgave him the entire script ahead of time, while Cliff only got the pages for his own scenes.
Zelda drives Ronnie's car through town, stopping to behead one last Fashion Zombie, and then walks calmly through the cemetery with sword in hand. Zombies amble away from the patrol car as a spinning UFO appears over the cemetery. Cliff and Ronnie watch as it beams up Zelda and departs. The two leave the car, and kill zombies including Bobby, Miller, Danny, Hank, and Mindy. Hermit Bob watches from the woods through binoculars, lamenting how the world is a terrible place, as zombies overwhelm Cliff and Ronnie.
In February 2018, during the press tour forIsle of Dogs,Bill MurrayandTilda Swintonannounced their involvement in a zombie film directed byJim Jarmusch.[7]
In March 2018, Murray announced thatDaniel CraigandRosie Perezwere set to costar. Speaking of the project, Murray stated:
It's a zombie movie. Jim Jarmusch has written a zombie script that's so hilarious and it has a cast of great actors: Rosie Perez, Daniel Craig. It's titledThe Dead Don't Die, and it shoots over the summer. But, no, I will not play a zombie.[8]
In July 2018, it was announced thatAdam Driver,Selena Gomez,Chloë Sevigny,Austin Butler,Steve Buscemi,Tilda Swinton, andCaleb Landry Joneshad been cast alongside Murray, though Craig did not appear in the film.Joshua Astrachanand Carter Logan produced the movie, whileFocus Featuresdistributes.[9][4][10][11]
Filming took place in and around small communities north of New York City, includingAncram,Elizaville,FleischmannsandMargaretville, New York.
The Dead Don't Diehad its world premiere as the opening film at theCannes Film Festivalon May 14, 2019.[12]The film was released in the United States on June 14, 2019[13]and on July 12, 2019 in the United Kingdom. The studio spent $2–3 million on domestic promotion.[14]
The Dead Don't Diegrossed $6.5 million in North America and $8.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $15.3 million.[3][6]
In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.4 million from 613 theaters.[14]
Thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoesreports an approval rating of 54%, based on 318 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "The Dead Don't Diedabbles with tones and themes to varying degrees of success, but sharp wit and a strong cast make this a zom-com with enough brains to consume."[15]Metacriticassigned the film a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[16]
Alex Leininger ofPopMatterswrote "It's a curious film, one that acknowledges the end of the world blatantly without once forgetting to be steadfastly, almost dementedly, silly. It's a smart if minor work from a masterfully innovative director."[17]In a review forThe New York Times,A. O. Scottwrote that "The Dead Don't Dierespects thehorrorgenre without really committing to it."[18]
Todd McCarthy, writing forThe Hollywood Reporter, said of the film "At times, thedeadpanof Murray and Driver becomes, well, a bit deadening, and true wit is in short supply, even though the film remains amusing most of the way."[19]

Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

James Robert Jarmusch(/ˈdʒɑːrməʃ/JAR-məsh;[1]born January 22, 1953) is an American film director, screenwriter and musician.
He has been a major proponent ofindependent cinemasince the 1980s, directing films such asStranger Than Paradise(1984),Down by Law(1986),Mystery Train(1989),Dead Man(1995),Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai(1999),Coffee and Cigarettes(2003),Broken Flowers(2005),Only Lovers Left Alive(2013), andPaterson(2016).Stranger Than Paradisewas added to theNational Film Registryin December 2002.[2]As a musician, he has been part of theno wavebandThe Del-Byzanteensand in addition composed music for some of his films. He has released three musical albums withJozef van Wissem.
Jarmusch was born inCuyahoga Falls, Ohio, the second of three children of middle-class suburbanites.[3][4][5][6]His mother, ofGermanandIrishdescent, was a reviewer of film and theatre for theAkron Beacon Journalbefore marrying his father, a businessman ofCzechand German descent who worked for theB.F. Goodrich Company.[5][7][8]She introduced Jarmusch to cinema by leaving him at a local theater to watch matinee double features such asAttack of the Crab MonstersandCreature From the Black Lagoonwhile she ran errands.[9][10]The first adult film he recalls seeing was the 1958 cult classicThunder Road, the violence and darkness of which left an impression on the seven-year-old Jarmusch.[11]AnotherB-movieinfluence from his childhood wasGhoulardi, an eccentric Cleveland television show which featured horror films.[10]
The key, I think, to Jim, is that he went gray when he was 15... As a result, he always felt like an immigrant in the teenage world. He's been an immigrant—a benign, fascinated foreigner—ever since. And all his films are about that.
Jarmusch was an avid reader in his youth and acquired an enthusiasm for film.[3]He had an even greater interest in literature which was encouraged by his grandmother.[7]Though he refused to attend church with hisEpiscopalianparents (not liking "the idea of sitting in a stuffy room wearing a little tie"), Jarmusch credits literature with shaping his metaphysical beliefs and leading him to reconsider theology in his mid-teens.[11]
From his peers, he developed a taste forcounterculture, and he and his friends would steal the records and books of their older siblings—this included works byWilliam Burroughs,Jack Kerouac, andThe Mothers of Invention.[3][12]They made fake identity documents which allowed them to visit bars at the weekend but also the local art house cinema, which typically showed pornographic films but would occasionally featureunderground filmssuch asRobert Downey, Sr.'sPutney SwopeandAndy Warhol'sChelsea Girls.[3][12]At one point, he took an apprenticeship with a commercial photographer.[3]He later remarked, "Growing up in Ohio was just planning to get out."[12]
After graduating from high school in 1971,[13]Jarmusch moved toChicagoand enrolled in theMedill School of JournalismatNorthwestern University.[6][14]After being asked to leave because he had neglected to take any journalism courses—Jarmusch favored literature and art history—he transferred toColumbia Universitythe following year, with the intention of becoming a poet.[11][14]At Columbia he studiedEnglishandAmerican literatureunder professors includingNew York Schoolavant garde poetsKenneth KochandDavid Shapiro.[7]At Columbia, he began to write short "semi-narrative abstract pieces"[7]and edited the undergraduate literary journalThe Columbia Review.[6][15]
During his final year studying at Columbia, Jarmusch moved toParisfor what was initially a summer semester on an exchange program, but turned into 10 months.[3][13]He worked as a delivery driver for an art gallery and spent most of his time at theCinémathèque Française.[3][6]
That's where I saw things I had only read about and heard about—films by many of the good Japanese directors, likeImamura,Ozu,Mizoguchi. Also, films by European directors likeBressonandDreyer, and even American films, like the retrospective ofSamuel Fuller's films, which I only knew from seeing a few of them on television late at night. When I came back from Paris, I was still writing, and my writing was becoming more cinematic in certain ways, more visually descriptive.
Jarmusch graduated from Columbia University with aBachelor of Artsdegree in 1975.[6]He was broke and working as a musician inNew York Cityafter returning from Paris in 1976. He applied on a whim to the graduate film school ofNew York University'sSchool of the Arts(then under the direction of Hollywood directorLászló Benedek).[7][3][14]Though he lacked experience in filmmaking, his submission of a collection of photographs and an essay about film secured his acceptance into the program.[7]He studied there for four years; he met fellow students and future collaboratorsSara Driver,Tom DiCillo,Howard Brookner, andSpike Leein the process.[6]During the late 1970s in New York City, Jarmusch and his contemporaries were part of anno wavecultural scene centered on theCBGBmusic club which inspired the formation of his no wave bandThe Del-Byzanteens.[16]
In his final year at New York University, Jarmusch worked as an assistant to the film noir directorNicholas Ray, who was at that time teaching in the department.[6]In an anecdote, Jarmusch recounted the formative experience of showing his mentor his first script; Ray disapproved of its lack of action, to which Jarmusch responded after meditating on the critique by reworking the script to be even less eventful. On Jarmusch's return with the revised script, Ray reacted favourably to his student's dissent, citing approvingly the young student's obstinate independence.[17]Jarmusch was the only person Ray brought to work—as his personal assistant—onLightning Over Water, a documentary about his dying years on which he was collaborating withWim Wenders.[3]Ray died in 1979 after a long fight with cancer.[6]A few days afterwards, having been encouraged by Ray and New York underground filmmakerAmos Poeand using scholarship funds given by theLouis B. Mayer Foundationto pay for his school tuition,[7][18]Jarmusch started work on a film for his final project.[19][6]The university was unimpressed with Jarmusch's use of his funding as well as the project itself and refused to award him a degree.[13]
Jarmusch's final year university project was completed in 1980 asPermanent Vacation, his first feature film. It had its premiere at the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg (formerly known as Filmweek Mannheim) and won the Josef von Sternberg Award.[13]It was made on a shoestring budget of around $12,000 in misdirected scholarship funds and shot by cinematographer Tom DiCillo on16 mm film.[20]The quasi-autobiographical feature follows an adolescent drifter (Chris Parker) as he wanders around downtown Manhattan.[21][22]
The film was not released theatrically and did not attract the sort of adulation from critics that greeted his later work.The Washington Poststaff writer Hal Hinson would disparagingly comment in an aside during a review of Jarmusch'sMystery Train(1989) that in the director's debut, "the only talent he demonstrated was for collecting egregiously untalented actors".[23]The bleak and unrefinedPermanent Vacationis nevertheless one of the director's most personal films, and established many of the hallmarks he would exhibit in his later work, including derelict urban settings, chance encounters, and a wry sensibility.[22][24]
Jarmusch's first major film,Stranger Than Paradise, was produced on a budget of approximately $125,000 and released in 1984 to much critical acclaim.[25][26]A deadpan comedy recounting a strange journey of three disillusioned youths from New York through Cleveland to Florida, the film broke many conventions of traditional Hollywood filmmaking.[27]It was awarded theCamera d'Orat the1984 Cannes Film Festivalas well as the 1985National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film,[28][29]and became a landmark work in modernindependent film.[30]
In 1986, Jarmusch wrote and directedDown by Law, starring musiciansJohn LurieandTom Waits, and Italian comic actorRoberto Benigni(his introduction to American audiences) as three convicts who escape from a New Orleans jailhouse.[31]Shot like the director's previous efforts in black and white, thisconstructivistneo-noirwas Jarmusch's first collaboration with Dutch cinematographerRobby Müller, who had been known for his work with Wenders.[32]
His next two films each experimented with parallel narratives:Mystery Train(1989) told three successive stories set on the same night in and around a smallMemphishotel, andNight on Earth(1991)[33]involved five cab drivers and their passengers on rides in five different world cities, beginning at sundown in Los Angeles and ending at sunrise in Helsinki.[17]Less bleak and somber than Jarmusch's earlier work,Mystery Trainnevertheless retained the director's askance conception of America.[34]He wroteNight on Earthin about a week, out of frustration at the collapse of the production of another film he had written and the desire to visit and collaborate with friends such as Benigni,Gena Rowlands,Winona Ryder, andIsaach de Bankolé.[35]
As a result of his early work, Jarmusch became an influential representative of the trend of the Americanroad movie.[36]Not intended to appeal to mainstream filmgoers, these early Jarmusch films were embraced by art house audiences,[37]gaining a small but dedicated American following and cult status in Europe and Japan.[38]Each of the four films had its premiere at theNew York Film Festival, whileMystery Trainwas in competition at the1989 Cannes Film Festival.[28]Jarmusch's distinctive aesthetic andauteurstatus fomented a critical backlash at the close of this early period, however; though reviewers praised the charm and adroitness ofMystery TrainandNight On Earth, the director was increasingly charged with repetitiveness and risk-aversion.[13][28]
A film appearance in 1989 as a used car dealer in the cult comedyLeningrad Cowboys Go Americafurther solidified his interest and participation in the road movie genre. In 1991 Jarmusch appeared as himself in Episode One of John Lurie's cult television seriesFishing With John.
In 1995, Jarmusch releasedDead Man, a period film set in the 19th century American West starringJohnny DeppandGary Farmer. Produced at a cost of almost $9 million with a high-profile cast includingJohn Hurt,Gabriel Byrneand, in his final role,Robert Mitchum,[39]the film marked a significant departure for the director from his previous features.[40]Earnest in tone in comparison to its self-consciously hip and ironic predecessors,Dead Manwas thematically expansive and of an often violent and progressively more surreal character.[13][40]The film was shot in black and white by Robby Müller, and features a score composed and performed byNeil Young, for whom Jarmusch subsequently filmed the tour documentaryYear of the Horse, released to tepid reviews in 1997.
Though ill-received by mainstream American reviewers,Dead Manfound much favor internationally and among critics, many of whom lauded it as a visionary masterpiece.[13]It has been hailed as one of the few films made by a Caucasian that presents an authentic Native American culture and character, and Jarmusch stands by it as such, though it has attracted both praise and castigation for its portrayal of the American West, violence, and especially Native Americans.[41]
Following artistic success and critical acclaim in the American independent film community, he achieved mainstream recognition with his far-East philosophical crime filmGhost Dog: The Way of the Samurai(1999), shot in Jersey City and starringForest Whitakeras a young inner-city man who has found purpose for his life by unyieldingly conforming it to theHagakure, an 18th-century philosophy text and training manual for samurai, becoming, as directed, a terrifyingly deadly hit-man for a local mob boss to whom he may owe a debt, and who then betrays him. The soundtrack was supplied byRZAof the Wu-Tang Clan, which blends into the director's "aesthetics of sampling".[42]The film was unique among other things for the number of books important to and discussed by its characters, most of them listed bibliographically as part of the end credits. The film is also considered to be a homage toLe Samourai, a 1967 French New Wave film by auteurJean-Pierre Melville, which starred renowned French actorAlain Delonin a strikingly similar role and narrative.[citation needed]
A five-year gap followed the release ofGhost Dog, which the director has attributed to a creative crisis he experienced in the aftermath of theSeptember 11 attacksin New York City.[9]2004 saw the eventual release ofCoffee and Cigarettes, a collection of eleven short films of characters sitting around drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes that had been filmed by Jarmusch over the course of the previous two decades. The first vignette, "Strange to Meet You", had been shot for and aired onSaturday Night Livein 1986, and paired Roberto Benigni with comedianSteven Wright. This had been followed three years later by "Twins", a segment featuring actorsSteve BuscemiandJoieandCinqué Lee, and then in 1993 with theShort Film Palme d'Or-winning "Somewhere in California", starring musicians Tom Waits andIggy Pop.[43]
He followedCoffee and Cigarettesin 2005 withBroken Flowers, which starredBill Murrayas an early retiree who goes in search of the mother of his unknown son in attempt to overcome a midlife crisis. Following the release ofBroken Flowers, Jarmusch signed a deal withFortissimo Films, whereby the distributor would fund and have "first-look" rights to the director's future films,[44]and cover some of the overhead costs of his production company, Exoskeleton.[45]The film premiered at the58th Cannes Film Festivalwhere it competed for thePalme d'Orand received theGrand Prix. Film criticPeter BradshawforThe Guardiandescribed the film as "Jarmusch's most enjoyable, accessible work for some time, perhaps his most emotionally generous film...a very attractive piece of film-making, bolstered by terrific performances from an all-star cast, spearheaded by endlessly droll, seductively sensitive Bill Murray."[46]
In 2009, Jarmusch releasedThe Limits of Control, a sparse, meditative crime film set in Spain, it starredIsaach de Bankoléas a lone assassin with a secretive mission.[47]A behind-the-scenes documentary,Behind Jim Jarmusch, was filmed over three days on the set of the film inSevilleby director Léa Rinaldi.[48]Also in 2009, Jarmusch appeared as himself in an episode of the HBO seriesBored to Death, and the following year, Jarmusch helped to curate theAll Tomorrow's Partiesmusic festival in Monticello, New York.
In an August 2010 interview, Jarmusch revealed his forthcoming work schedule at that time:
I'm working on a documentary about the Stooges [Iggy Pop-fronted band]. It's going to take a few years. There's no rush on it, but it's something that Iggy asked me to do. I'm co-writing an "opera". It won't be a traditional opera, but it'll be about the inventorNikola Tesla, with the composer Phil Klein. I have a new film project that's really foremost for me that I hope to shoot early next year with Tilda Swinton and Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska, who was Alice in Wonderland in Tim Burton's film. I don't have that quite financed yet, so I'm working on that. I'm also making music and hoping to maybe score some silent films to put out. Our band will have an EP that we'll give out at ATP. We have enough music for three EPs or an album.[49]
Jarmusch eventually attained funding for the aforementioned film project after a protracted period and, in July 2012, Jarmusch began shootingOnly Lovers Left AlivewithTilda Swinton,Tom Hiddleston,Mia Wasikowska,Anton Yelchin, and Hurt,[50]while Jarmusch's musical projectSqürlwere the main contributors to the film's soundtrack.[51]The film screened at the2013 Cannes Film Festivaland the 2013Toronto International Film Festival(TIFF),[52]with Jarmusch explaining the seven-year completion time frame at the former: "The reason it took so long is that no one wanted to give us the money. It took years to put it together. Its (sic) getting more and more difficult for films that are a little unusual, or not predictable, or don't satisfy people's expectations of something."[53]The film's budget wasUS$7 million and its UK release date was February 21, 2014.[54]
Jarmusch wrote and directedPatersonin 2016. The film follows the daily experiences of an inner-city bus driver and poet (Adam Driver) inPaterson, New Jersey, who shares the same name as the city. Paterson was inspired by objectivist American poet William Carlos Williams and his epic poem "Paterson[55]".[56]The film features the wry, minimalist style[57]found in Jarmusch's other works[58]and earned 22 award nominations for Jarmusch, Driver and Nellie, the dog featured in the film. The story focuses on Paterson's poetry writing efforts, interspersed with his observations and experiences of the residents he encounters on his bus route and in his daily life. Todd McCarthy ofThe Hollywood Reportergave the film a positive review, writing: "A mild-mannered, almost startlingly undramatic work that offers discreet pleasures to longtime fans of the New York indie-scene veteran, who can always be counted on to go his own way."[59]Eric Kohn, film critic ofIndieWirewrote that the film was "an apt statement from Jarmusch, a filmmaker who continues to surprise and innovate while remaining true to his singular voice, and who here seems to have delivered its purest manifestation."[60]
Jarmusch wrote and directed his first horror film, the zombie comedyThe Dead Don't Diefeaturing an ensemble cast which included performances fromBill Murray,Adam Driver,Chloë Sevigny,Steve Buscemi,Tilda Swinton,Carol Kane, andSelena Gomez. The film premiered at the72nd Cannes Film Festivaland received mixed reviews. The film was distributed byFocus Features. Todd McCarthy ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote of the film, "At times, thedeadpanof Murray and Driver becomes, well, a bit deadening, and true wit is in short supply, even though the film remains amusing most of the way."[61]
Jarmusch directed and wrote a short film titledFrench Waterfor theYves Saint LaurentHouse of Fashion to celebrate their spring/summer 2021 collection. It starredCharlotte GainsbourgandJulianne Moore, among others.[62][63][64]
In September 2021, Jarmusch published withAnthology Editionsa hardcover book of his small-scalecollageart calledSome Collageswith texts byLucy Santeand Randy Kennedy.[65]
In the early 1980s, Jarmusch was part of a revolving lineup of musicians inRobin Crutchfield's Dark Day project,[66]and later became the keyboardist and one of two vocalists forThe Del-Byzanteens,[6]aNo Waveband who released the LPLies to Live Byin 1982.[67]
Jarmusch is also featured on the albumWu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture(2005) in two interludes described by Sean Fennessy in aPitchforkreview of the album as both "bizarrely pretentious" and "reason alone to give it a listen".[68]Jarmusch andMichel Gondryeach contributed a remix to a limited edition release of the track "Blue Orchid" by The White Stripes in 2005.[69]
He released three collaborative albums with lutistJozef van Wissem:Concerning the Entrance into Eternity(Important Records);The Mystery of Heaven(Sacred Bones Records) in 2012, and the 2019 releaseAn Attempt to Draw Aside the Veil(Sacred Bones Records).[70][71][72]Jarmusch and van Wissem also collaborated on the soundtrack ofOnly Lovers Left Alive.
Jarmusch first met van Wissem on a street in New York City'sSoHoneighborhood in 2007, at which time the lute player handed the director a CD. Several months later, Jarmusch asked van Wissem to send his catalog of recordings and the two started playing together as part of their developing friendship. Van Wissem explained in early April 2014: "I know the way [Jarmusch] makes his films is kind of like a musician. He has music in his head when he's writing a script so it's more informed by a tonal thing than it is by anything else."[73]
Jarmusch is a member of the avant-garde rock band Sqürl with film associate Carter Logan and sound engineer Shane Stoneback.[74][75][76][77]The band formed to create additional soundtracks for Jarmusch's filmThe Limits of Control, which they released together with two other songs on an EP called "Film Music from The Limits of Control" under the name Bad Rabbit.[78][79][80][81]Sqürl's version ofWanda Jackson's 1961 song "Funnel of Love", featuring Madeline Follin ofCultson vocals, opens Jarmusch's 2014 filmOnly Lovers Left Alive.[73]On March 8, 2023, Sqürl announced its debut albumSilver Hazeand released lead single "Berlin '87". The album was released on May 5 bySacred Bones Records.[82]
In 2014, Jarmusch shunned the "auteur theory" and likened the filmmaking process to human sexual reproduction:
I put 'A film by' as a protection of my rights, but I don't really believe it. It's important for me to have a final cut, and I do for every film. So I'm in the editing room every day, I'm the navigator of the ship, but I'm not the captain, I can't do it without everyone's equally valuable input. For me it's phases where I'm very solitary, writing, and then I'm preparing, getting the money, and then I'm with the crew and on a ship and it's amazing and exhausting and exhilarating, and then I'm alone with the editor again... I've said it before, it's like seduction, wild sex, and then pregnancy in the editing room. That's how it feels for me.[51]
Jarmusch recorded a Q & A in 2010 for the Criterion Blu-ray release ofMystery Train. He explained at the beginning that he did this, instead of the usual practice of a director's commentary to be played over the film itself, because "I don't like looking at my films again--it's agony to me."
Nothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is nonexistent. And don't bother concealing your thievery—celebrate it if you feel like it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: "It's not where you take things from—it's where you take them to."
Jarmusch has been characterized as a minimalist filmmaker whose idiosyncratic films are unhurried.[25][84]His films often eschew traditional narrative structure, lacking clear plot progression and focus more on mood and character development.[9][84][85]In an interview early in his career, he stated that his goal was "to approximate real time for the audience."[86]
His early work is marked by a brooding, contemplative tone, featuring extended silent scenes and prolonged still shots.[40]He has experimented with a vignette format in three films that were either released, or begun around, the early 1990s:Mystery Train,Night on EarthandCoffee and Cigarettes.The Salt Lake Tribunecritic Sean P. Means wrote that Jarmusch blends "film styles and genres with sharp wit and dark humor",[87]while his style is also defined by a signature deadpan comedic tone.[47]
The protagonists of Jarmusch's films are usually lone adventurers.[19]The director's male characters have been described by critic Jennie Yabroff as "three time losers, petty thiefs and inept con men, all... eminently likeable, if not down right charming";[40]while novelistPaul Austerdescribed them as "laconic, withdrawn, sorrowful mumblers".[15]
Jarmusch has revealed that his instinct is a greater influence during the filmmaking process than any cognitive processes. He explained: "I feel like I have to listen to the film and let it tell me what it wants. Sometimes it mumbles and it isn't very clear." Films such asDead ManandLimits of Controlhave polarized fans and general viewers alike, as Jarmusch's stylistic instinct is embedded in his strong sense of independence.[88]
Though his films are predominantly set in the United States, Jarmusch has advanced the notion that he looks at America "through a foreigner's eyes", with the intention of creating a form of world cinema that synthesizes European and Japanese film with that of Hollywood.[7]His films have often included foreign actors and characters, and (at times substantial) non-English dialogue. In his two later-nineties films, he dwelt on different cultures' experiences of violence, and on textual appropriations between cultures: a wandering Native American's love ofWilliam Blake, a black hitman's passionate devotion to theHagakure. The interaction and syntheses between different cultures, the arbitrariness of national identity, and irreverence towards ethnocentric, patriotic or nationalistic sentiment are recurring themes in Jarmusch's work.[40][89]
Jarmusch's fascination with music is another characteristic that is readily apparent in his work.[13][34]Musicians appear frequently in key roles—John Lurie,Tom Waits,Gary Farmer,Youki Kudoh,RZAandIggy Pophave featured in multiple Jarmusch films, whileJoe StrummerandScreamin' Jay Hawkinsappear inMystery TrainandGZA,JackandMeg Whitefeature inCoffee and Cigarettes. Hawkins' song "I Put a Spell on You" was central to the plot ofStranger than Paradise, whileMystery Trainis inspired by and named aftera songpopularized byElvis Presley, who is also the subject of a vignette inCoffee and Cigarettes.[13]In the words of criticVincent Canby, "Jarmusch's movies have the tempo and rhythm of blues and jazz, even in their use—or omission—of language. His films work on the senses much the way that some music does, unheard until it's too late to get it out of one's head."[34]
During a 1989 interview Jarmusch commented on his narrative focus, "I'd rather make a movie about a guy walking his dog than about the emperor of China."[90]
In 1980, Jarmusch's filmPermanent Vacationwon the Josef von Sternberg Award at the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg. In 1999, he was laureate of theDouglas SirkPreis atFilmfest Hamburg,Germany.[92]In 1984, he won theCaméra d'Orat Cannes Film Festival forStranger Than Paradise.[93]In 2004, Jarmusch was honored with the "Filmmaker on the Edge Award" at theProvincetown International Film Festival.[94]In 2005, he won theGrand Prixof the2005 Cannes Film Festivalfor his filmBroken Flowers.[95]
Jarmusch is credited with having instigated the American independent film movement withStranger Than Paradise.[31]In her description of the film in a 2005 profile of the director forThe New York Times, critic Lynn Hirschberg declared thatStranger than Paradise"permanently upended the idea of independent film as an intrinsically inaccessible avant-garde form".[4]The success of the film accorded the director a certain iconic status withinarthouse cinema, as an idiosyncratic and uncompromisingauteur, exuding the aura of urban cool embodied bydowntown Manhattan.[96][97]Such perceptions were reinforced by the release of his subsequent features in the late 1980s, establishing him as one of the generation's most prominent and influential independent filmmakers.[98][99]
New York critic and festival director Kent Jones undermined the "urban cool" association that Jarmusch has garnered and was quoted in a February 2014 media article, following the release of his eleventh feature film:
There's been an overemphasis on the hipness factor—and a lack of emphasis on his incredible attachment to the idea of celebrating poetry and culture. You can complain about the preciousness of a lot of his movies, [but] they are unapologetically standing up for poetry. [His attitude is] 'if you want to call me an elitist, go ahead, I don't care'.[88]
Jarmusch's staunch independence has been represented by his success in retaining the negatives for all of his films, an achievement that was described by theGuardian's Jonathan Romney as "extremely rare." British producerJeremy Thomas, who was one of the eventual financiers ofOnly Lovers Left Alivecalled Jarmusch "one of the great American independent film-makers" who is "the last of the line." Thomas believes that filmmakers like Jarmusch "are not coming through... any more."[88]
In a 1989 review of his work,Vincent CanbyofThe New York Timescalled Jarmusch "the most adventurous and arresting film maker to surface in the American cinema in this decade".[34]He was recognized with the "Filmmaker on the Edge" award at the 2004Provincetown International Film Festival.[100]A retrospective of the director's films was hosted at theWalker Art Centerin Minneapolis, Minnesota, during February 1994, and another, "The Sad and Beautiful World of Jim Jarmusch", by theAmerican Film Institutein August 2005.[101][102]
While Swinton, who has worked with Jarmusch on numerous occasions, describes him as a "rock star", the director admits that "I don't know where I fit in. I don't feel tied to my time." Dutch lute player Jozef van Wissem, who worked on the score forOnly Lovers Left Alivecalls Jarmusch a "cultural sponge" who "absorbs everything."[88]
The moving image collection of Jim Jarmusch is held at theAcademy Film Archive.[103]
Jarmusch rarely discusses his personal life in public.[5][9]He divides his time between New York City and theCatskill Mountains.[5][104]He stopped drinking coffee in 1986, the year of the first installment ofCoffee and Cigarettes, although he continues to smoke cigarettes.[105]He has been avegetariansince 1987.[106]
Jarmusch has been a supporter of Pro-Palestine causes and was one of 55 celebrities to sign theArtists4Ceasefireletter calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.[107][108][109]
The author of a series of essays on influential bands, Jarmusch has also had at least two poems published. He is a founding member ofThe Sons of Lee Marvin, a humorous "semi-secret society" of artists resembling the iconic actor, which issues communiqués and meets on occasion for the ostensible purpose of watching Marvin's films.[4][110]
In a February 2014 interview, Jarmusch stated that he is not interested in eternal life, as "there's something about the cycle of life that's very important, and to have that removed would be a burden".[51]

Linked page for 'Iggy Pop' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iggy_Pop):
James Newell Osterberg Jr.(born April 21, 1947), known professionally asIggy Pop, is an American singer, musician, songwriter, actor and radio broadcaster. He was the vocalist and lyricist ofproto-punkbandthe Stooges, who were formed in 1967 and have disbanded and reunited many times since.[1]Often called the "Godfather of Punk",[2][3]he was named one of the50 Great VoicesbyNPR. In 2010, he was inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Fameas a member of the Stooges. Pop also received aGrammy Lifetime Achievement Awardin 2020 for his solo work.[4]
Initially playing a raw, primitive style ofrock and roll(progressing later towards more experimental and aggressive rock), the Stooges sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which often involved acts ofself-mutilationby Pop.[5]He had a long collaborative relationship and friendship withDavid Bowieover the course of his career, beginning with the Stooges' albumRaw Powerin 1973. Both musicians went toWest Berlinto wean themselves off their respective drug addictions and Pop began his solo career by collaborating with Bowie on the 1977 albumsThe IdiotandLust for Life, Pop usually contributing the lyrics. Throughout his career, he is well known for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics, poetic lyrics and distinctive voice.[6][7][8]He was one of the first performers to do astage-diveand popularized the activity.[9][10]Pop, who traditionally (but not exclusively) performs bare-chested, also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass andexposing himselfto the crowd.[10]
Pop's music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of his career, includinggarage rock,punk rock,hard rock,heavy metal,art rock,new wave,grunge,jazz,bluesandelectronic.[11][12]Though his popularity has fluctuated, many of Pop's songs have become well known, including "Search and Destroy" and "I Wanna Be Your Dog" by the Stooges, and his solo hits "Lust for Life", "The Passenger" and "Real Wild Child (Wild One)". In 1990, he recorded his only Top 40 U.S. hit, "Candy", a duet withthe B-52s' singerKate Pierson. Pop's song "China Girl" became more widely known when it was re-recorded by co-writer Bowie, who released it as the second single from his most commercially successful album,Let's Dance(1983). Bowie re-recorded and performed many of Pop's songs throughout his career.
Although Pop has had limited commercial success, he has remained a culture icon and a significant influence on a wide range of musicians in numerous genres. The Stooges' albumRaw Powerhas proved an influence on artists such asSex Pistols,[13]the Smiths,[14]andNirvana.[15]His solo albumThe Idiothas been cited as a major influence on a number ofpost-punk, electronic andindustrialartists includingDepeche Mode,Nine Inch NailsandJoy Division,[16]and was described bySiouxsie Siouxas a "re-affirmation that our suspicions were true: the man is a genius."[17]
James Newell Osterberg was born inMuskegon, Michigan, on April 21, 1947, the son of Louella (néeChristensen; 1917–1996)[18]and James Newell Osterberg (1921–2007),[19]an English teacher and baseball coach atFordson High SchoolinDearborn, Michigan.[20]He is of English, German, and Irish descent on his father's side, and Danish and Norwegian ancestry on his mother's side. His father was adopted by a Swedish-American nurse surnamed Osterberg.[21]The family lived in atrailer parkinYpsilanti, Michigan.[10]Ron Ashetonlater described him as having been a conventional teenager: "He hung out with the popular kids that wore chinos, cashmere sweaters, and penny loafers. Iggy didn't smoke cigarettes, didn't get high, didn't drink."[22]
Osterberg began to play drums in the fifth grade, first starting with rubber pads glued to plywood, before his parents bought him a drum set.[22]In a 2007Rolling Stoneinterview, he explained his relationship with his parents and their contribution to his music:
Once I hit junior high inAnn Arbor, I began going to school with the son of the president ofFord Motor Company, with kids of wealth and distinction. But I had a wealth that beat them all. I had the tremendous investment my parents made in me. I got a lot of care. They helped me explore anything I was interested in. This culminated in their evacuation from the master bedroom in the trailer, because that was the only room big enough for my drum kit. They gave me their bedroom.[23]
Osterberg began his music career as a drummer in various high school bands inAnn Arbor, Michigan, includingthe Iguanas, who covered several records such asBo Diddley's "Mona" in 1965.[24]He then began exploring localblues-style bands such asthe Prime Movers(with brothers Dan andMichael Erlewine), which he joined at 18 years old. The Prime Movers gave him the nickname "Iggy" for having played in the Iguanas.[25]According to biographer Jim Ambrose, the two years he spent in the band made him aware of "art, politics, and experimentation".[26]
Osterberg eventually dropped out of theUniversity of Michigan[27]and moved to Chicago to learn more about blues. While in Chicago, he played drums in blues clubs, helped bySam Lay(formerly of thePaul Butterfield Blues Band) who shared his connections with Pop.[28]Inspired byChicago bluesas well as bands likethe Sonics,MC5andthe Doors, he formedthe Psychedelic Stooges. The band was composed of Osterberg on vocals,Ron Ashetonon guitar, Asheton's brotherScotton drums, andDave Alexanderon bass. Their first show was played at a Halloween party at a house in Detroit, Michigan. Members of the MC5 were also in attendance. Osterberg became interested in Ron Asheton after seeing him perform in the Chosen Few (a covers band), believing "I've never met a convincing musician that didn't look kind of ill and kind of dirty, and Ron had those two things covered!"[29]The three nicknamed Osterberg "Pop" after a local character named Jim Popp,[30]who he was said to have resembled after shaving his eyebrows.[31]
The seeds of Pop's stage persona were sown when he sawthe Doorsperform in 1967 at the University of Michigan and was amazed by the stage antics and antagonism displayed by singerJim Morrison.[10]Morrison's extreme behavior, while performing in a popular band, inspired the young Pop to push the boundaries of stage performance. Other influences on Pop's vocals and persona wereMick JaggerandJames Brown:
I attended two concerts by the Doors. The first one I attended was early on and they had not gotten their shit together yet. That show was a big, big, big influence on me. They had just had their big hit, "Light My Fire" andthe albumhad taken off. ... So, here's this guy, out of his head onacid, dressed in leather with his hair all oiled and curled. The stage was tiny and it was really low. It got confrontational. I found it really interesting. I loved the performance ... Part of me was like, "Wow, this is great. He's really pissing people off and he's lurching around making these guys angry." People were rushing the stage and Morrison's going "Fuck you. You blank, blank, blank." You can fill in your sexual comments yourself. The other half of it was that I thought, "If they've got a hit record out and they can get away with this, then I have no fucking excuse not to get out on stage with my band." It was sort of the case of, "Hey, I can do that." There really was some of that in there.[32]
In addition to Jim Morrison and the Doors' influence on the band, Pop also attributes the Stooges getting jump-started after seeing an all-girl rock band fromPrinceton, New Jersey, called the Untouchable. In a 1995 interview withBust, he relates:
And the other thing was we went to New York. We had gone to New York a couple of months before that just to check out the scene, and we had never been to a place like New York ... we went down around Eighth Street there where all the young tourists hang out, and we met these girls from New Jersey, from Princeton, they had a band called The Untouchable, and we're like, "Oh, you've got a band, sure, ha ha ha," and they said "Well, come to our house and see us play." And we didn't have anywhere to crash, and they played for us, and they completely rocked, and we were really ashamed.
In 1968, one year after their live debut and now dubbedthe Psychedelic Stooges, the band signed withElektra Records, again following in the footsteps of the Doors, who were Elektra's biggest act at the time (according to Pop, guitaristRon AshetoncalledMoe Howardto see if it was all right to call the band "The Stooges", to which Howard responded by merely saying "I don't care what they call themselves, as long as they're notTheThreeStooges!" and hung up the phone). Pop himself told the story in the 2016 Jim Jarmusch documentary film about the Stooges,Gimme Danger. The Stooges' first albumThe Stooges(on which Pop was credited as "Iggy Stooge") was produced byJohn Calein New York in 1969. Both it and the follow-up,Fun House, produced by Don Gallucci in Los Angeles in 1970, sold poorly. Though the release ofFun Housedid not receive the recognition expected, it was later ranked No. 191 inRolling Stone's'500 Greatest Albums of All Time' in 2003.[33]Shortly after the release ofFun House, the group disbanded because of Pop's worseningheroin addiction.
In 1971, without a record deal, the Stooges kept performing in small clubs with a five-piece lineup that included both Ron Asheton andJames Williamsonon guitars and Jimmy Recca on bass, Pop having fired Dave Alexander the previous year when he turned up for a gig unable to play because of his chronic alcoholism. That year Pop andDavid Bowiemet atMax's Kansas City, a nightclub and restaurant in New York City.[34]Pop's career received a boost from his relationship with Bowie when Bowie decided in 1972 to produce an album with him in England. With Williamson signed on as guitarist, the search began for arhythm section. However, since neither Pop nor Williamson were satisfied with any players in England, they decided to re-unite the Stooges. Ron Asheton grudgingly moved from guitar to bass. The recording sessions produced the rock landmarkRaw Power. After its release,Scott Thurstonwas added to the band on keyboards/electric piano and Bowie continued his support, but Pop'sdrug problempersisted. The Stooges' last show in 1974 ended in a fight between the band and a group ofbikers, documented on the albumMetallic K.O.Drug abuse stalled Pop's career again for several years.
After the Stooges' second breakup, Pop made recordings with James Williamson, but these were not released until 1977 (asKill City, credited jointly to Pop and Williamson).[14]Pop was unable to control hisdrug useand checked himself into amental institution, theUCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, to try to clean up. Bowie was one of his few visitors, continuing to support his friend and collaborator. In 1976, Bowie took Pop as his companion on theStation to Stationtour. This was Pop's first exposure to large-scale professional touring, and he was impressed, particularly with Bowie's work ethic. Following a March 21, 1976, show, Bowie and Pop were arrested together formarijuanapossession inRochester, New York, although charges were later dropped.[35]
Bowie and Pop relocated to West Berlin to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions. "Living in a Berlin apartment with Bowie and his friends was interesting…" Pop recalled. "The big event of the week was Thursday night. Anyone who was still alive and able to crawl to the sofa would watchStarsky & Hutch."[36]
In 1977, Pop signed withRCA Records. Bowie helped write and produceThe IdiotandLust for Life,Pop's two most acclaimed albums as a solo artist, the latter featuring one of his best-known songs, "The Passenger".Lust for Lifefeatured another team of brothers,HuntandTony Fox Sales, sons of comedianSoupy Sales. Among the songs Bowie and Pop wrote together were "China Girl", "Tonight", and "Sister Midnight", all of which Bowie performed on his own albums later (the last being recorded with different lyrics as "Red Money" onLodger). Bowie also played keyboards in Pop's live performances, some of which are featured on the albumTV Eye Livein 1978. In return, Pop contributed backing vocals on Bowie'sLow.[37]
"Artistically, I really like those two records,The IdiotandLust for Life," Pop said. "But I was personally just miserable… David was a really good friend to me in many ways, but… he hadhis whole thinggoing on and a whole apparatus of people around him, and problems that he had to face. For more than year, I lived in the room next door, and I had a good friendship, but it wasn't the same as being ina band."[38]
Pop had grown dissatisfied with RCA, later admitting that he had madeTV Eye Liveas a quick way of fulfilling his three-album RCA contract. He moved toArista Records, under whose banner he releasedNew Valuesin 1979. This album was something of a Stooges reunion, with James Williamson producing and latter-day StoogeScott Thurstonplaying guitar and keyboards. Not surprisingly, the album's style harkened back to the guitar sound of the Stooges.New Valueswas not a commercial success in the U.S. but has since been highly regarded by critics.
The album was moderately successful in Australia and New Zealand, however, and this led to Pop's first visit there to promote it. While in Melbourne, he made a memorable appearance on theAustralian Broadcasting Corporation's nationwide showCountdown. During his anarchic performance of "I'm Bored", Pop made no attempt to conceal the fact that he waslip-synching(shoving the microphone down his pants at one point), and he even tried to grab the teenage girls in the audience. He was also interviewed by hostMolly Meldrum, an exchange which was frequently punctuated by the singer jumping up and down on his chair and making loud exclamations of "G'day mate" in a mockAustralian accent. HisCountdownappearance is generally considered one of the highlights of the show's history and it cemented his popularity with Australian punk fans, since then he has often toured there. While visiting New Zealand, Pop recorded a music video for "I'm Bored" and attended a record company function where he appeared to slap a woman and throw wine over a photographer.[39]While in Australia, Pop was also the guest on a live late-night commercial TV interview show on theTen Network. TheCountdownappearance has often been re-screened in Australia.
During the recording ofSoldier(1980), Pop and Bowie argued with Williamson over various aspects of the project. Williamson recalled, "I was not at all happy with a number of aspects of that record including the band, the material and the recording facilities. So I was unhappy in general and vice versa".[40]Williamson left the project. Bowie appeared on the song "Play it Safe", performing backing vocals with the groupSimple Minds. During a live performance in Brooklyn in 1981, Pop smashed a microphone into his own face, knocking out a front tooth.[41]BothSoldierand its follow-upParty(1981) were commercial failures, and Pop was dropped from Arista.
In 1980, Pop published his autobiographyI Need More, co-written with Anne Wehner, an Ann Arbor arts patron. The book, which includes a selection of black and white photographs, featured a foreword byAndy Warhol. Warhol wrote that he met Pop when he was Jim Osterberg, at the Ann Arbor Film Festival in 1966. "I don't know why he hasn't made it really big," Warhol wrote. "He is so good."[42]
The 1982 albumZombie BirdhouseonChris Stein's Animal label, with Stein himself producing, was no more commercially successful than his Arista works. In 1983, Pop's fortunes changed when David Bowie recorded a cover of the song "China Girl". The song had originally appeared onThe Idiotand was a major hit on Bowie's blockbusterLet's Dancealbum. As co-writer of the song, Pop received substantialroyalties. OnTonightin 1984, Bowie recorded five more of their co-written songs (2 fromLust for Life, 1 fromNew Values, and 2 new songs), assuring Pop financial security, at least for the short term. The support from Bowie enabled Pop to take a three-year break, during which he overcame his resurgent heroin addiction and took acting classes.[43]
Additionally, Pop contributed the title song to the 1984 filmRepo Man(withSteve Jones, previously of theSex Pistols, on guitar, andNigel HarrisonandClem Burke, both ofBlondieon bass and drums) as well as an instrumental called "Repo Man Theme" that was played during the opening credits.[44]
In 1985, Pop recorded some demos with Jones. He played these demos for Bowie, who was sufficiently impressed to offer to produce an album for Pop: 1986'snew wave-influencedBlah-Blah-Blah, featuring the single
"Real Wild Child", a cover of "The Wild One", originally written and recorded by Australian rock 'n' roll musicianJohnny O'Keefein 1958. The single was a Top 10 hit in the UK and was successful around the world, especially in Australia, where it has been used since 1987 as the theme music for theABC's late-night music video showRage.Blah-Blah-Blahwas Pop's highest-charting album in the U.S. sinceThe Idiotin 1977, peaking at No. 75 on theBillboard200chart.
Also in 1985, Pop andLou Reedcontributed their singing voices to the animated filmRock & Rule. Pop performed the song "Pain & Suffering" in the final sequence of the film.[45]
In 1987, Pop appeared (along withBootsy Collins) on a mostly instrumental album,Neo Geo, by Japanese composerRyuichi Sakamoto. The music video for "Risky", written and directed by Meiert Avis, won the first MTV Breakthrough Video Award.[citation needed]The groundbreaking video explorestranshumanistphilosopherFM-2030's ideas ofNostalgia for the Futurein the form of an imagined love affair between a robot and one ofMan Ray's models in Paris in the late 1930s. Additional inspiration was drawn fromJean Baudrillard,Edvard Munch's 1894 paintingPuberty, andRoland BarthesDeath of the Author. The surrealist black-and-white video uses stop motion, light painting, and other retro in-camera effects techniques. Meiert Avis recorded Sakamoto while at work on the score forThe Last Emperorin London. Sakamoto also appears in the video painting words and messages to an open shutter camera. Pop, who performs the vocals on "Risky", chose not to appear in the video, allowing his performance space to be occupied by the surrealist era robot.
Pop's follow-up toBlah Blah Blah,Instinct(1988), was a turnaround in musical direction. Its stripped-back, guitar-based sound leaned further towards the sound of the Stooges than any of his solo albums to date. His record label dropped him, but theKing Biscuit Flower Hourradio show recorded theInstincttour (featuring guitaristAndy McCoyandAlvin Gibbson bass) in Boston on July 19, 1988. Working with rock attorney Stann Findelle, Pop scored more movie soundtrack inclusions in 1989: "Living on the Edge of the Night" in theRidley ScottthrillerBlack Rain; and "Love Transfusion", a song originally written byAlice Cooper(who does backing vocals) andDesmond Child,[46]inWes Craven's Shocker. Also, at the same time, Pop, dissatisfied from RCA's decisions, revoked copyrights of his RCA releases, assigned it to his companyThousand Mile, and signed a contract withVirgin Records, which was a unique hybrid of distribution deal for his RCA releases and a recording contract for new albums. Virgin first reissuedLust for LifeandThe Idiotin 1990, thenTV Eye Live 1977in 1994.
In 1990, Pop recordedBrick by Brick. The album was produced byDon Wasand featured members ofGuns N' Rosesandthe B-52'sas guests. HisKiss My Bloodvideo (1991) was directed byTim Popeand filmed at the Olympia in Paris. The video attracted much controversy, as it included footage of Pop performing with his penis exposed to the audience.Brick by Brickfeatured his first Top 40 U.S. hit, "Candy", a duet with B-52's singerKate Pierson.
Also in 1990, Pop sang the role of "The Prosecutor" for thePOINT Music/Philips Classicsrecording (released in 1992) of composerJohn Moran's multimedia opera[47]The Manson Family.[48][49]That year he also contributed to theRed Hot Organization's AIDS benefit albumRed Hot + Blueproject, singing a version of "Well Did You Evah!" in a duet withDebbie Harry.
In the early to middle 1990s, Pop would make several guest appearances on theNickelodeonshowThe Adventures of Pete and Pete. He played James Mecklenberg, Nona Mecklenberg's father.
In 1991, Pop and Kirst contributed the song "Why Was I Born (Freddy's Dead)" to the soundtrack of the filmFreddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. The song also plays over the end credits of the film, with a compilation of clips from theA Nightmare on Elm Streetseries running alongside the end credits. In the same year, Pop sang a leading role in theJohn MoranoperaThe Manson Family.
In 1992, he collaborated withGoran Bregovićon thesoundtrackfor the movieArizona DreambyEmir Kusturica. Pop sang four of the songs:In the Deathcar,TV Screen,Get the Money, andThis is a Film. Also in 1992, he collaborated with the New York City bandWhite Zombie. He recorded spoken word vocals on the intro and outro of the song "Black Sunshine" as well as playing the character of a writer in the video shot for the song.
In 1993, Pop releasedAmerican Caesar, including two successful singles, "Wild America" and "Beside You". The following year Pop contributed toBuckethead's albumGiant Robot, including the songs "Buckethead's Toy Store" and "Post Office Buddy". He appears also on theLes Rita MitsoukoalbumSystème Dwhere he sings the duet "My Love is Bad" withCatherine Ringer.
In 1996, Pop again found mainstream fame when his 1977 song "Lust for Life" was featured in the filmTrainspotting. A new video was recorded for the song, with clips from the film and studio footage of Pop dancing with one of the film's stars,Ewen Bremner. A Pop concert also served as a plot point in the film. The song has also been used in TV commercials forRoyal Caribbeanand as the theme music toThe Jim Rome Show, a nationally syndicated American sports talk show.
In 1996, Pop releasedNaughty Little Doggieand the single "I Wanna Live". In 1997, heremixedRaw Powerto give it a rougher, more hard-edged sound; fans had complained for years that Bowie's official "rescue effort" mix was muddy and lacking in bass. Pop testified in the reissue's liner notes that on the new mix, "everything's still in the red". He co-produced his 1999 albumAvenue BwithDon Was, releasing the single "Corruption".
In 1997, Pop was credited with the soundtrack to the filmThe Brave.[50][51][52]

Diggs was born on July 5, 1969, inBrownsville, Brooklyn. He was named after the Kennedy brothersRobertandJohn Fitzgerald, both of whom his mother greatly admired.[8]Diggs has called his given name an "honorable" name, given the legacy of both Robert and John. Diggs has a younger brother, Terrance Hamlin, better known as the rapper9th Prince, and an older brother named Mitchell “Divine” Diggs.
From ages three to seven, Diggs spent summers inNorth Carolinawith his uncle, who encouraged him to read and study.[9]Diggs was introduced tohip hop musicat the age of nine, and by eleven, was competing inrap battles. He relocated toSteubenville, Ohio, in 1990, to live with his mother. He spent weekends inPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his father ran a convenience store in the city'sHill District.[10]
Diggs got involved with petty crime and drug-dealing, and was charged with attempted murder while in Steubenville. He was acquitted of the charge, giving him what he has called a "second chance".[11]
Diggs first became interested in making his own hip-hop music in 1979 when a friend of his introduced him toRapper's DelightbyThe Sugarhill Gangand in 1984, Diggs formed a rap group with his cousinsRussell Jones, then known as The Specialist, andGary Grice, then known as Allah Justice, called "Force of the Imperial Master", which they soon after renamed as"All in Together Now"in 1985. Around this time Diggs formed the DMD Posse which consisted of RZA, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, U-God,Inspectah Deck, 4th Disciple andMethod Man.[1]Diggs and Grice then signed with Jamaica Records for management purposes and Jamaica convincedTommy Boy Recordsto sign Diggs as a solo artist in 1989 under the namePrince Rakeem.[1]He released the originalOoh I Love You Rakeempromotion version of the EP, but was forced to remix and rerelease the single when Tommy Boy failed to acquire the rights to the original sample. The rereleased version underperformed commercially, and Diggs was subsequently dropped by Tommy Boy.[1]
After a shoot-out in Ohio in 1992, he faced eight years in jail. "When they said 'not guilty', my face stuck in a smile for three days," he recalled. "I was just walking around town, thinking about my daughter and my wife. Right then I said goodbye to anything that would put me in that situation again. I was up on trial on anattempted murdercharge. I was a motherfucking fool, with all that knowledge in my head and ending up there."[12]In 1992, Diggs formed a new group with his two cousins and five other childhood friends. They named the groupWu-Tang Clan, after the 1983kung fufilmShaolin and Wu Tang. As part of the group's formation, each member chose a new nickname for themselves. Diggs chose "RZA", based on a nickname he had been given by fans of his music, "Rza Rza Rakeem", which in turn was based on a song by All in Together Now, "Pza Pza Pumpin", as well as Diggs'graffiti tag, "Razor". He created abackronymfor "RZA", stating that the name stood for "Ruler, Zig-Zag-Zig, Allah" which further translated into "Ruler, Knowledge-Wisdom-Understanding, Allah" when using theSupreme Alphabet.[13]
Wu-Tang Clan released its first single, "Protect Ya Neck", in December 1992.Masta Killathen joined the group in 1993, becoming its ninth member. They released their debut album,Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)in November 1993.[14]RZA operated as Wu-Tang Clan's de facto leader, producing the group's songs and deciding who would get placed on which tracks.
As each of the group's members embarked on solo careers, RZA continued to produce nearly everything Wu-Tang released during the period 1994–1996, which included both composing and arranging the instrumental tracks as well as overseeing and directing the creative process. RZA's rule over the Clan at this time is described in 2004'sWu-Tang Manualbook as "a dictatorship". He also released a hit single of his own, in the form of "Wu-Wear: The Garment Renaissance". The song was featured on theHigh School Highsoundtrack, and was released to promote the Wu-Tang clothing brand, also called "Wu-Wear". It peaked at #60 on theBillboardHot 100, and #6 on theHot Rap Singleschart.[15]

He had one single out on Tommy Boy that didn't take off, but he was a dope MC. As the Grym Reaper, you know how many dope lyrics he dropped. Frukwan, one of the top lyricists out ofStetsasonic. He and Paul were friends already. He told him about me. He said, "I know this one guy who is super-dope."
At the same time, I was also trying to do Wu-Tang. I was trying to start my own company and stuff, so when Paul called me up and invited me to his crib on Long Island and told me his idea for forming this group, I thought it would be an honor to be in a group with him. But I told him, "I'm also producing a group, and I'm also part of a family that I'm building." He said, "Yo, that's crazy." We would talk a lot of times. [Ol' Dirty Bastard] came to his house a lot of times with me. [Method Man], too. We all would just go there and try to find ways to get out of the streets. Me, I was trying to get out of the ghetto. Paul had a lot of respect for me, so he helped me break out of it. I think he liked that I was so dark, but I didn't know I was dark.[16]
1997 saw the release ofWu-Tang Forever, the Wu-Tang Clan's highly anticipated second album. The album for the first time featured RZA delegating a small number of beat-making duties to other producers in the Wu-Tang camp, such as his protégésMathematics,True Masterand4th Disciplewho are known as the originalWu-Elements, and Clan memberInspectah Deck.[17]
During the 1998–2000 period RZA ceased to produce every Wu-Tang solo album as he had done previously, but continued to contribute usually one or two songs on average to each record as well as receiving an Executive Producer credit.
"I had to put outBobby Digitalinstead ofThe Curebecause if I didn't do that I would've suffered two things. First, I would have revealed where I was musically too soon. Wu-Tang is the perfect medium to expose anything new because I got the most people coming together to buy it. For me to expose it for my own self, I don't think that would've been a wise thing for me to do. I might've caught more people than Bobby Digital caught, but I still wouldn't catch the magnitude of what the Wu-Tang could catch. Maybe this year or next year the game may be different.The Cureis so intimate in writing that you gotta live that Cure shit. I was living like Bobby Digital in '98, '99 na'mean? So if I put "The Cure" out, then I wouldn't even be able to get on stage and perform it for ya'll cause I'd be lying."
In 1999 the RZA moved into composing film scores. His first work,Jim Jarmusch'sGhost Dog: The Way of the Samurai(1999), earned praise; he also had a brief cameo in the film itself, as a fellow samurai wearing camouflage. The experience was positive and, as he noted during an interview onNational Public Radio'sFresh Air, the work with traditional musicians gave him the desire to learn how to read and write music.[18]In 2004, he co-scoredDavid S. Goyer's"Blade: Trinity"with composerRamin Djawadi.
This is one of my biggest adventures, and one of my [best] feelings. We watchedKill BillinManhattan. At the premiere, that happened, but you know, that's Hollywood. But in Manhattan, a theater, just a bunch of kids coming from wherever New York, inside a movie theater and the movie's coming on. They don't even know that I'm the man with the music, and when it said, "Original Music by The RZA", we hear the audience clapping. And they didn't clap for nothing else, because the movie's just coming on. I was like, 'Wow, what the fuck is that about?' That's different. It actually might be something special. You never care who did that... Once you see who stars in the shit, you don't read "edited", you don't read all that. You be eating your popcorn and it go right by you. But, for somebody to see that and then clap, that's a different thing right there. That felt pretty pleasing.
He has also stated that the long-delayedThe Curealbum will be his final solo album, so that he can devote more time to his movie directing career.[19]
Before signing withSRC Recordsin 2007, RZA was flooded with offers fromBad Boy Records,Aftermath Records,InterscopeandDef Jamamong others for the Wu-Tang Clan super-group.[20]
In 2007, he produced thescoreof the Japanese animeAfro SamuraistarringSamuel L. Jackson. In 2007 he released the little-publicized instrumental albumThe RZA-Instrumental Experience, and worked with Raekwon on his highly anticipatedOnly Built 4 Cuban Linx II. From 2005 to 2008 he collaborated withSystem of a DownbassistShavo Odadjianon the projectAchozen[21]The group released two singles, one of which, "Deuces", was included in the 2009 filmBabylon A.D.The group also recorded an album that has remained unreleased, although eight of the songs were released in 2015.
"The time is right to bring some older material to the masses digitally. Our fans have been dedicated and patient, and they're hungry to hear the music that has set us apart from so many others.Hip-hopis alive inWu Music, and with The Orchard, we've got a solid partner that understands our audience and is committed to doing all they can to help us reach the fans. I'm definitely looking forward to working with them to see what else we all come up with. There's much more to come."[22]
In 2010 he worked on what was intended as a solo album for GZA,Liquid Swords II,[23]but the album remains unreleased. RZA also worked withKanye Weston the latter's fifth album,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,[24]as well asWatch the Throneby Kanye and Jay-Z.
In a 2011 interview, RZA revealed that he had recently decided to clean out his beat machines of instrumentals he made for the Wu-Tang Clan that were never used; as a result, he gave away ten beats each toNas,Busta RhymesandTalib Kweli, as well as 20 beats for Kanye West, including two that were used on West's previous two albums.[25]RZA produced UK artistJosh Osho's 2012 debut albumL.I.F.E.
RZA also contributed vocals to three songs onJohn Frusciante's 2012 EPLetur-Lefrand in 2013 he contributed vocals to one song onKid Cudi's 2013 albumIndicud.In August 2012 RZA founded a new record label,Soul Temple Records, with a distribution deal fromRED Distribution. On September 28, 2012, he hosted one episode of the web seriesEquals Three, substituting for regular hostRay William Johnson. He appeared onEarl Sweatshirt's albumDoris, contributing a verse on the track "Molasses". Despite artistic disagreements withRaekwon, RZA and The Wu-Tang Clan released their sixth albumA Better Tomorrowin 2014.
In 2013, RZA andPaul Banksbegan to collaborate asBanks & Steelzfor what became the 2016 albumAnything But Words.[26][27]Guest appearances include Kool Keith, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, and Masta Killa.[27]Two singles were released from the album, "Love + War" and "Giant".[27]RZA collaborated withRamin Djawadi, with whom he co-scored Blade Trinity and Blake Perlman for the song "Drift" for theGuillermo del Torofilm"Pacific Rim".
In June 2020, ice cream companyGood Humorapproached RZA to create a new jingle forice cream trucksto play,[28]to replace the tune "Turkey in the Straw", long associated withminstrel showsthat often featured racist lyrics. (Good Humor does not directly operate any trucks, but the company wanted to encourage ice cream truck drivers to not play the song.)[29]RZA's resulting composition was released in August 2020.[30]
In a 2020 interview, RZA discussed how being stuck at home during theCOVIDglobal crisisresulted in him resuming work on his long-unreleasedThe Curealbum.[31]
In August 2024, RZA released the albumA Ballet Through Mud, an orchestral ballet score. The score was conceived during theCOVID-19 pandemicbased on a notebook of lyrics RZA had written as a teenager. Before being released as an album, the score premiered in 2023 on stage through a performance by theColorado Symphony.[32]
Since the early 1990s, variousWu Tang Clan-affiliated recording labelswere established. The earlier labels are believed to be dissolved. The connection that RZA had to these labels is unknown.
Other record labels were later founded in the early 2000s, and are still active in the present. Very little is known about these labels, other than the fact that RZA produces music on them. It is unknown if RZA is CEO, or has high position within these labels, considering that he was never known to have a CEO position of any recording label.
RZA's production technique, specifically the manner of chopping up and/or speeding or slowing soul samples to fit his beats, has been imitated by hip hop producers includingKanye WestandJust Blaze. West's own take on RZA's style[33]briefly flooded the rap market with what was dubbed "chipmunk soul," the speeding of a vocal sample to where it sounded as though the singer had inhaled helium. Several producers at the time copied the style, creating other offshoots. West has admitted that his style was distinctly influenced by the RZA's production, saying[34]
"Wu-Tang? Me and my friends talk about this all the time... We think Wu-Tang had one of the biggest impacts as far as a movement. From slang to style of dress, skits, the samples. Similar to the [production] style I use, RZA has been doing that."[35]
In response, RZA himself has spoken quite positively of the comparisons:
"All good. I got super respect for Kanye. He came up to me about a year or two ago. He gave me mad praising and blessings... For people to say Wu-Tang inspire Kanye, Kanye is one of the biggest artists in the world. That goes back to what we say: 'Wu-Tang is forever.' Kanye is going to inspire people to be like him."[36]
After hearing Kanye's work onThe Blueprint, RZA claimed that a torch-passing had occurred between him and West, saying, "The shoes gotta be filled. If you ain't gonna do it, somebody else is gonna do it. That's how I feel about rap today."[36]
His Bobby Digital albums introduced tweaked-outnew ageelements to his sound; these have incorporated themselves more fully into his beats on newer albums such as Method Man's4:21... The Day After.
"The way I produce now is I produce more like a musician", RZA said. "In the old days, I produced more like a DJ. I didn't understandmusic theoryat all. Now that I do understand music theory, I make my music more playable, meaning not only could you listen to it, you could get someone else to play it. Before, you couldn't even write down Wu-Tang music. I think almost 80 percent of this record can be duplicated by a band, which is important for music, because that means 10 years from now, somebody can make a whole song out of it and cover it like how I'm coveringThe Beatlessong."[37]
In a 2010 radio interview with UK hip hop station Conspiracy Worldwide Radio, RZA spoke in great detail about the homemade, candid ethos of much of his work, including the organic creation process behind ODB's debut album.[38]

Every time it comes on TV or cable, I have to stop and watch it. And it's based on nothing, really. There's only a few people out there that are able to do that, where it comes from nothing but the vision and imagination of the artist.[47]

She currently plays the recurring role of Pelia inStar Trek: Strange New Worlds(2023–present).
Kane was born on June 18, 1952, in Cleveland, the daughter of Joy, ajazzsinger, teacher, dancer, and pianist, and architect Michael Kane.[2]Her family is Jewish, and her grandparents emigrated from Russia, Austria, and Poland.[3][4]Due to her father's occupation, Kane moved frequently as a child; she briefly lived in Paris at age eight, where she began learning to speak French.[2][5]Additionally, she resided inHaitiat age 10.[2]Her parents divorced when she was 12 years old.[6]
She attended the Cherry Lawn School, a boarding school in Darien, Connecticut, until 1965.[7][8]She studied theater atHB Studio[9]and also went to theProfessional Children's Schoolin New York City. She became a member of both theScreen Actors Guildand theActors' Equity Associationat age 14.[10]Kane made her professional theater debut in a 1966 production ofThe Prime of Miss Jean BrodiestarringTammy Grimes, her first job as a member of Actors' Equity.[11][12]
Kane's on-screen career began while she was still a teenager, when she appeared in minor roles in films such asDesperate CharactersandMike Nichols'sCarnal Knowledgein 1971, the latter of which led her to befriend lead actorJack Nicholson. In 1972, she was cast in her first leading role in the Canadian productionWedding in White, where she played a teenage rape victim who is forced into marriage by her father. She also appeared as asex workerinHal Ashby's 1973 filmThe Last Detail, where she collaborated with Nicholson yet again.[13]
In 1975, Kane was cast inJoan Micklin Silver's feature-length debutHester Street, in which she played aRussian-Jewishimmigrant who struggles with her husband to assimilate in late 19th-century New York.[13]For her performance in the film, Kane garnered her sole Academy Award nomination forBest Actressat the48th Academy Awards, and it remains her favorite of all her roles.[5]Additionally, 1975 saw her appear as a bank teller inSidney Lumet's crime dramaDog Day Afternoon, which received numerous Academy Award nominations in other categories that same year. This also marked her first on-screen collaboration withAl Pacino, whom she had known prior to the film thanks to their shared background in theater.[4][14]
Despite this recognition, however, Kane has recounted waiting for approximately a year before being cast in her next role, which she has attributed to the trend of actors being typecast after receiving awards attention.[15]Her return to the screen would come withGene Wilder's 1977 comedyThe World's Greatest Lover,which she has credited for identifying the comedic talents that would become her staple in later years.[14]During the same year, she was cast inWoody Allen's romantic comedyAnnie Hall, where she played Allison Portchnik, the first wife of Allen's character Alvy Singer.[2]She also appeared inKen Russell's filmValentino, which, likeThe World's Greatest Lover, takes inspiration from thesilent filmera, as it is a biographical drama loosely inspired by the life ofRudolph Valentino.

From 1980 to 1983, Kane portrayed Simka Dahblitz-Gravas, the wife ofAndy Kaufman's characterLatka Gravas, on the American television seriesTaxi. She has theorized that she was cast inTaxiin part due to her work inHester Street, where a significant portion of her dialogue was spoken inYiddish, since Simka speaks a fictional language with a vaguelyEastern Europeanaccent.[18]
Kane has attributed the on-screen rapport she shared with Kaufman to their different work ethics: where she was trained in the theater and enjoyed rehearsal time, Kaufman was rooted more instand-up comedyand did not care for rehearsals, a contrast that she believes enhanced their believability as a married couple.[19][12]However, she maintains that she and Kaufman had a loving relationship on set, and she has spoken fondly of him in retrospective interviews.[5][12]Kane received twoEmmy Awardsfor her work onTaxi.[13]Her role on the series has largely been credited as the beginning of her pivot towards more comedic roles, as she began to regularly appear insitcomsand comedy films after the series ended.[16][20]

Thomas Alan Waits(born December 7, 1949) is an American musician, composer, songwriter, and actor. His lyrics often focus on society's underworld and are delivered in his trademark deep, gravelly voice. He began in thefolkscene during the 1970s, but his music since the 1980s has reflected the influence of such diverse genres asrock,jazz,Delta blues,opera,vaudeville,cabaret,funk,hip hopand experimental techniques verging onindustrial music.[1]PerThe Wall Street Journal, Waits "has composed a body of work that's at least comparable to any songwriter's in pop today. A keen, sensitive and sympathetic chronicler of the adrift and downtrodden, Mr. Waits creates three-dimensional characters who, even in their confusion and despair, are capable of insight and startling points of view. Their stories are accompanied by music that's unlike any other in pop history."[2]
Tom Waits was born and raised in a middle-class family inPomona, California. Inspired by the work ofBob Dylanand theBeat Generation, he began singing on theSan Diegofolk circuit.[3][4]He relocated toLos Angelesin 1972, where he worked as a songwriter before signing a recording contract withAsylum Records.

He repeatedly toured the United States, Europe and Japan, and found greater critical and commercial success withSmall Change(1976),Blue Valentine(1978) andHeartattack and Vine(1980). During this period, Waits entered the world of film, acting inParadise Alley(1978), where he met a young story editor namedKathleen Brennan.[5]He composed thesoundtrackforFrancis Ford Coppola'sOne from the Heart(1982) and made cameos in several subsequent Coppola films.

Waits went on to releaseReal Gone(2004), the compilationOrphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards(2006), the live albumGlitter and Doom Live(2009) andBad as Me(2011).
Waits has influenced many artists and gained an internationalcult following. His songs have been covered byBruce Springsteen,Tori Amos,Rod Stewartand theEaglesand he has written songs forJohnny CashandNorah Jones, among others. In 2011, he was inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Fame. Introducing him,Neil Youngsaid: "This next man is indescribable, and I'm here to describe him. He's sort of a performer, singer, actor, magician, spirit guide, changeling... I think it's great that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has recognized this immense talent. Could have been the Motion Picture Hall of Fame, could have been the Blues Hall of Fame, could have been the Performance Artist Hall of Fame, but it was the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that recognized the great Tom Waits." In accepting the award, Waits mused, "They say that I have no hits and that I'm difficult to work with. And they say that like it's abadthing!"[6]
Thomas Alan Waits was born on December 7, 1949, inPomona, California.[8]He has one older and one younger sister.[9]His father, Jesse Frank Waits, was aTexasnative of Scots-Irish descent, and his mother, Alma Fern (née Johnson), hailed fromOregonand had Norwegian ancestry.[10][11]Alma, a regular church-goer, managed the household. Jesse taught Spanish at a local school and was an alcoholic; Waits later related that his father was "a tough one, always an outsider."[12]They lived at 318 North Pickering Avenue inWhittier, California. He recalled having a "very middle-class" upbringing and "a pretty normal childhood". He attended Jordan Elementary School, where he was bullied. There, he learned to play thebugleandguitar. His father taught him to play theukulele.[13]
During the summers, he visited maternal relatives inGridleyandMarysville. He later recalled that it was an uncle's raspy, gravelly timbre that inspired his own singing voice.[14]In 1959, his parents separated and his father moved away from the family home, a traumatic experience for the 10-year-old Waits.[15]Alma took her children and relocated toChula Vista, a middle-class suburb ofSan Diego.[16]Jesse visited the family there, taking his children on trips toTijuana.[17]In nearbySoutheast San Diego, Waits attendedO'Farrell Community School, where he fronted a school band, the Systems,[18]which he described as "white kids trying to get thatMotownsound." He developed a love ofR&Bandsoulsingers likeRay CharlesandWilson Pickett, as well ascountry musicandRoy Orbison.[19]Bob Dylanlater became an inspiration; Waits placed transcriptions of Dylan's lyrics on his bedroom walls.[20]
Waits recalls: "I was fifteen and I snuck into seeLightnin' Hopkins. Amazing show. Every time he opened his mouth he had that orchestra of gold teeth, and I was devastated ... He walked through a door, and slammed the door behind him, and on the door it said, I swear to God, 'KEEP OUT. This room is for entertainers ONLY.' And I knew, at that moment, that I had to get into show business as soon as possible."[6]He recalls: "I first sawJames Brownin 1962 at an outdoor theatre in San Diego and it was indescribable ... it was like putting a finger in a light socket ... It was really like seeing mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Christmas."[21]By the time he was studying atHilltop High School,[22][23]he later related, he was "kind of an amateur juvenile delinquent", interested in "malicious mischief" and breaking the law.[24]He later described himself as a "rebel against the rebels", eschewing thehippiesubculture which was growing in popularity for the 1950sBeat generation,[25]especiallyJack Kerouac,Allen GinsbergandWilliam S. Burroughs.[26]In 1968, at age 18, he dropped out of high school.[7]He was an avid watcher ofAlfred Hitchcock PresentsandThe Twilight Zone.[27]Another influence was the comedianLenny Bruce.[28]
Waits worked at Napoleone's pizza restaurant inNational City, California, and both there and at a local diner developed an interest in the lives of the patrons, writing down phrases and snippets of dialogue he overheard.[29]He worked in the forestry service as a fireman for three years[30]and served with theCoast Guard.[31]He enrolled at Chula Vista'sSouthwestern Community Collegeto study photography, for a time considering a career in the field. He continued pursuing his musical interests, taking piano lessons. He began frequenting venues around San Diego, being drawn into the city'sfolkscene.[32]
In 1969, he was hired as an occasional doorman for the Heritage coffeehouse, which held regular performances from folk musicians.[33][34]He also began to sing at the Heritage; his set initially consisted largely of covers of Dylan andRed Sovine's "Phantom 309".[35]In time, he performed his own material as well, often parodies of country songs or bittersweet ballads influenced by his relationships; these included early songs "Ol' 55" and "I Hope That I Don't Fall in Love With You".[36]As his reputation grew, he played at other San Diego venues, supporting acts likeTim Buckley,Sonny Terry,Brownie McGheeand his friendJack Tempchin. Aware that San Diego offered little opportunity for career progression, Waits began traveling into Los Angeles to play at theTroubadourin West Hollywood.[37]It was there, in the autumn of 1971, that Waits came to the attention ofHerb Cohen, who signed him to publishing and recording contracts.[38]The recordings that were produced under that recording agreement were eventually released in the early 1990s asThe Early YearsandThe Early Years, Volume Two. In early 1972, after quitting his job at Napoleone's to concentrate on his songwriting career, Waits moved to an apartment inSilver Lake, Los Angeles, a poor neighborhood known for its Hispanic andbohemiancommunities.[39]He continued performing at the Troubadour and there metDavid Geffen, who gave Waits a recording contract with hisAsylum Records.[40]Jerry Yesterwas chosen to produce his first album, with the recording sessions taking place in Hollywood'sSunset Soundstudios.[41]The resulting album,Closing Time, was released in March 1973,[42]although it attracted little attention[43]and did not sell well.[44]BiographerBarney Hoskynsnoted thatClosing Timewas "broadly in step with the singer-songwriter school of the early 1970s";[45]Waits had wanted to create a piano-led jazz album although Yester had pushed its sound in a more folk-oriented direction. Buckley covered "Martha" on his albumSefronialater that year.[46]AnEaglesrecording of "Ol' 55" on their albumOn the Borderbrought Waits further money and recognition, although he regarded their version as "a little antiseptic".[47]
To promote his debut, Waits and a three-piece band embarked on a U.S. tour, where he was the supporting act for more established artists.[48]He supportedTom RushatWashington D.C.'sThe Cellar Door,Danny O'KeefeinCambridge, Massachusetts'sClub Passim,Charlie RichatNew York City'sMax's Kansas City,Martha Reeves and the VandellasinEast Lansing, Michigan, andJohn P. HammondinSan Francisco.
Waits returned to Los Angeles in June, feeling demoralized about his career.[49]That month, he was the cover star of free music magazineMusic World.[50]He began composing songs for his second album, and attended theVenicePoetry Workshop to try out this new material in front of an audience.[51]Although Waits was eager to record this new material, Cohen instead convinced him to take over as a support act forFrank Zappa'sthe Mothers of Inventionafter previous support actKathy Daltonpulled out due to the hostility from Zappa's fans. Waits joined Zappa's tour inOntario, but like Dalton found the audiences hostile; while on stage he was jeered at and pelted with fruit.[52]Although he liked the Mothers of Invention, he was intimidated by Zappa himself.[53]
Waits moved from Silver Lake toEcho Park, spending much of his time indowntown Los Angeles.[54]In early 1974, he continued to perform around the West Coast, getting as far asDenver.[55]For Waits's second album, Geffen wanted a more jazz-oriented producer, selectingBones Howefor the job.[56]Howe recounts his first encounter with the young artist: "I told him I thought his music and lyrics had aKerouacquality to them, and he was blown away that I knew who Jack Kerouac was. I told him I also played jazz drums and he went wild. Then I told him that when I was working forNorman Granz, Norman had found these tapes of Kerouac reading his poetry from The Beat Generation in a hotel room. I told Waits I'd make him a copy. That sealed it."[57]Recording sessions forThe Heart of Saturday Nighttook place atWally Heider's Studio 3onCahuenga Boulevardin Hollywood in April and May,[58]with Waits conceptualizing the album as a sequence of songs about U.S. nightlife.[59]The album was far more widely reviewed thanClosing Timehad been.[60]Waits himself later dismissed the album as "very ill-formed, but I was trying".[61]
After recordingThe Heart of Saturday Night, Waits reluctantly agreed to tour with Zappa again, but once more faced strong audience hostility. The kudos of having supported Zappa's tour nevertheless bolstered his image in the music industry and helped his career.[62]In October 1974, he first performed as the headline act before touring the East Coast; in New York City he met and befriendedBette Midler,[63]with whom he had a sporadic affair.[64]Back in Los Angeles, Cohen suggested Waits produce alive album. To this end, he performed two shows at theRecord PlantStudio in front of a small invited audience to recreate the atmosphere of ajazz club.[65][66]Again produced and engineered by Howe (as all his future Asylum releases would be), it was released asNighthawks at the Dinerin October 1975.[67]The album cover and title were inspired byEdward Hopper'sNighthawks(1942).
He followed this with a week's residency at the Reno Sweeney nightclub, an off-Broadway–style club in New York City.[68]In December he appeared on thePBSconcert showSoundstage.[69]From March to May 1976, he toured the U.S.,[70]telling interviewers that the experience was tough and that he was drinking too much alcohol.[71]In May, he embarked on his first tour of Europe, performing inLondon,Amsterdam,BrusselsandCopenhagen.[72]On his return to Los Angeles, he joined his friendChuck E. Weiss, moving into the Tropicana motel in West Hollywood, which had an established reputation in rock music circles.[73]Visitors noted his two-room apartment there was heavily cluttered. Waits told theLos Angeles Timesthat "You almost have to create situations in order to write about them, so I live in a constant state of self-imposed poverty".[74]
In July 1976, Waits recordedSmall Change, again produced by Howe.[75]He recalled it as a seminal episode in his development as a songwriter, the point when he became "completely confident in the craft".[76]The album was critically well received and was his first release to break into theBillboard Top 100 Album List, peaking at 89.[77]Per Bowman,Small Change"made it clear that Waits had evolved into a master storyteller, reflecting the influence of crime-noir writers such asDashiell HammettandJohn D. MacDonald. Arguably his first masterpiece, the album featured exquisite piano ballads such as 'Tom Traubert's Blues' and ‘The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me),’ the word-jazz of ‘Pasties and a G-String,’ and the tour-de-force tenor-sax-accompanied hucksterism of ‘Step Right Up.’”[1]He received growing press attention, being profiled inNewsweek,Time,VogueandThe New Yorker;[78]he had begun to accrue acult following.[79]He went on tour to promote the new album, backed by the Nocturnal Emissions (Frank Vicari,Chip Whiteand Fitz Jenkins).[80]In reference to "Pasties and a G-String", a female stripper joined him onstage.[81]He began 1977 by touringJapanfor the first time.[82]
Back in Los Angeles, he encountered various problems. One female fan, recently escaped from a mental health institution inIllinois, beganstalkinghim and lurking outside his Tropicana apartment.[82]In May 1977, Waits and close friendChuck E. Weisswere arrested for fighting with police officers in a coffee shop. They were charged with two counts of disturbing the peace but were acquitted after the defense produced eight witnesses who refuted the police officers' account of the incident.[83]In response, Waits sued theLos Angeles Police Departmentand five years later was awarded $7,500 in damages.[84]
In July and August 1977, he recorded his fourth studio album,Foreign Affairs;[85]Bob Alcivarhad been employed as itsarranger.[86]The album included "I Never Talk to Strangers", a duet with Midler, with whom he was still in an intermittent relationship.[87]She appeared with him at the Troubadour to sing the song; the next day he repaid the favor by performing at agay rightsbenefit at theHollywood Bowlthat Midler was involved with.[88]Foreign Affairswas not as well received by critics as its predecessor, and unlikeSmall Changefailed to make the Billboard Top 100 album chart.[89]That year, he began a relationship with the singer-songwriterRickie Lee Jones; their work and styles influenced each other.[90]In October 1977, he returned to touring with the Nocturnal Emissions; it was on this tour that he first began using props onstage, in this case a street lamp.[91]Again, he found the tour exhausting.[92]In March 1978, he embarked on his second tour of Japan.[93]
During these years, Waits sought to broaden his career beyond music. He befriended actor and directorSylvester Stalloneand made his film debut as a drunken piano player in Stallone'sParadise Alley(1978).[94]WithPaul Hampton, Waits also began writing a movie musical, although this project never came to fruition.[95]Another project he began at this time was a book about entertainers of the past whom he admired.[95]
In July 1978, Waits began the recording sessions forBlue Valentine.[96]Part way through the sessions, he replaced his musicians to create a less jazz-oriented sound;[97]for the album, he switched from a piano to an electric guitar as his main instrument.[98]For the album's back cover, Waits used a picture of himself and Jones leaning against his car, a1964 Ford Thunderbird, taken by Elliot Gilbert.[99]Per Bowman, "Waits gradually began writing about junkies and prostitutes instead of skid-row drunks. In songs such as'Christmas Card From a Hooker in Minneapolis’and ‘Red Shoes by the Drugstore,’ his writing became ever more vivid, compact, and complex."[100]From the album, Waits's first single, a cover of"Somewhere"fromWest Side Story, was released, but it failed to chart.[101]For hisBlue Valentinetour, Waits assembled a new band; he also had a gas station built as a set for his performances.[102]His support act on the tour wasLeon Redbone.[103]In April, he embarked on a European tour, there making television appearances and press interviews; in Austria he was the subject of a short documentary.[104]From there, he flew to Australia for his first tour of that country before returning to Los Angeles in May.[105]
Waits was dissatisfied with Elektra-Asylum, who he felt had lost interest in him as an artist in favor of their more commercially successful acts likethe Eagles,Linda Ronstadt,Carly SimonandQueen.[103]After a phone call with their mutual friend Chuck E. Weiss, Waits told Jones, "Chuck E.'s in love". This was the inspiration for her song "Chuck E.'s in Love".[106]Jones's musical career was taking off; after an appearance onSaturday Night Live, "Chuck E.'s In Love" reached number 4 in the singles chart, straining her relationship with Waits.[107]Their relationship was further damaged by Jones'sheroinaddiction.[108]Waits joined Jones for the first leg of her European tour, but then ended his relationship with her. Her grief at the breakup was channeled into the 1981 albumPirates.[109]In September, Waits moved toCrenshaw Boulevardto be closer to his father,[110]before deciding to relocate to New York City. He initially lived in theChelsea Hotelbefore renting an apartment on West 26th Street.[111]On arriving in the city, he told a reporter that he "just needed a new urban landscape. I've always wanted to live here. It's a good working atmosphere for me".[112]He considered writing aBroadwaymusical based onThornton Wilder'sOur Town.[113]ArotoscopedWaits performed "The One That Got Away" in the music videoTom Waits For No One(1979).
Francis Ford Coppolaasked Waits to return to Los Angeles to write a soundtrack for his forthcoming film,One from the Heart.[114]Waits was excited, but conflicted, by the prospect; Coppola wanted him to create music akin to his early work, a genre that he was trying to leave behind, and thus he characterized the project as an artistic "step backwards".[115]He nevertheless returned to Los Angeles to work on the soundtrack in a room set aside for the purpose in Coppola's Hollywood studios.[116]This style of working was new to Waits; he later recalled that he was "so insecure when I started ... I was sweating buckets".[117]Waits was nominated for the 1982Academy Award for Original Music Score.
Waits still contractually owed Elektra-Asylum another album, so took a break from Coppola's project to write an album that he initially calledWhite Spades.[118]He recorded the album in June;[119]it was released in September asHeartattack and Vine.[120]The album was more guitar-based and had, according to Humphries, "a harder R&B edge" than any of its predecessors.[121]It again broke into the Top 100 Album Chart,[122]peaking at number 96.[123]Reviews were generally good.[123]Hoskyns called it "one of Waits's pinnacle achievements" as an album.[122]One of its tracks, "Jersey Girl", was subsequently recorded byBruce Springsteen. Waits was grateful, both for the revenue that the cover brought him and because he felt appreciated by a songwriter he admired.[124]While on the set ofOne from the Heart, Waits encounteredKathleen Brennan, a youngIrish-Americanwoman working as an assistant story editor. The two had previously met while Waits was filmingParadise Alley.[125][126]Waits would later describe this encounter with Brennan as "love at first sight"; they were engaged to be married within a week.[127]In August 1980, they married at a 24-hour wedding chapel onManchester BoulevardinWattsbefore honeymooning inTralee, a town inCounty Kerry, Ireland, where Brennan had family.[128]
A whip and a chair. The Bible. The Book of Revelations. She grew up Catholic, you know, blood and liquor and guilt. She pulverizes me so that I don't just write the same song over and over again. Which is what a lot of people do, including myself.
Returning to Los Angeles, Waits and Brennan moved into a Union Avenue apartment.[130]Hoskyns noted that with Brennan, "Waits had found the stabilizing, nurturing companion he'd always wanted", and that she brought him "a sense of emotional security he had never known" before.[131]At the same time, many of his old friends felt cut off after his marriage.[132]Waits said of Brennan: "She rescued me. Maybe I rescued her too; that's often how it works. Upshot is that we both got into the same leaky boat. Maybe the weight drags it down, because now you've two people sitting in it. Sorry, baby! But on the other hand you've also got two peoples' imagination to patch it up again. Everybody knows she's the brains behind Pa, as Dylan might have said. I'm just the figurehead. She's the one who's steering the ship."[133]
Recording of Waits'sOne from the Heartsoundtrack began in October 1980 and continued until September 1981.[134]A number of the tracks were recorded as duets withCrystal Gayle; Waits had initially planned to duet with Midler but she proved unavailable.[135]The film was released in 1982, to largely poor reviews.[136]Waits makes a small cameo as a trumpet player in a crowd scene.[137]Waits'ssoundtrack albumwas released byColumbia Recordsin 1982.[138]Waits had misgivings about the album, thinking it over-produced.[139]Humphries thought that working with Coppola was an important move in Waits's career: it "led directly to Waits moving from cult (i.e. largely unknown) artiste to center-stage."[140]
Newly married and with his Elektra-Asylum contract completed, Waits decided that it was time to artistically reinvent himself.[141]He wanted to move away from using Howe as his producer, although the two parted on good terms.[142]With Brennan's help, he began the process of firing Cohen as his manager, with him and Brennan taking on managerial responsibilities themselves.[143]He came to believe that Cohen had been swindling him out of much of his earnings, later relating that "I thought I was a millionaire and it turned out I had, like, twenty bucks."[144]Waits credited Brennan with introducing him to much new music, most notablyCaptain Beefheart, a key influence on the direction in which he wanted to take his music.[145]He later said that "once you've heard Beefheart it's hard to wash him out of your clothes. It stains, like coffee or blood."[146]She also introduced him toHarry Partch, a composer who created his own instruments out of everyday materials.[147]Waits began to use images rather than moods or characters as the basis for his songs.[148]
I like to imagine how it feels for the object to become music. Imagine you're the lid to a fifty-gallon drum. That's your job. You work at that. That's your whole life. Then one day I find you and I say, "We're gonna drill a hole in you, run a wire through you, hang you from the ceiling of the studio, bang on you with a mallet, and now you're in show business, baby!"
Waits wrote the songs forSwordfishtrombonesduring a two-week trip to Ireland.[148]He recorded it at Sunset Sound studios and produced it himself; Brennan often attended the sessions and gave him advice.[150]Swordfishtrombonesabandoned the jazz sound characteristic of his earlier work; it was his first album not to feature a saxophone[151]and his first to feature themarimba.[100]When the album was finished, he took it to Asylum, but they declined to release it.[152]Waits wanted to leave the label; in his view, "They liked dropping my name in terms of me being a 'prestige' artist, but when it came down to it they didn't invest a whole lot in me in terms of faith".[153]Chris BlackwellofIsland Recordslearned of Waits's dissatisfaction and approached him, offering to releaseSwordfishtrombones;[154]Island had a reputation for signing more experimental acts, such asKing Crimson,Roxy MusicandSparks.[155]Waits did not tour to promote the album, partly because Brennan was pregnant.[156]Although unenthusiastic about the new trend formusic videos, he appeared in one for the song "In the Neighborhood", co-directed byHaskell WexlerandMichael A. Russ.[157]Russ also designed theSwordfishtrombonesalbum cover, featuring an image of Waits withLee Kolima, a circus strongman, andAngelo Rossitto, a dwarf.[158]
Jon Pareles, inGQ,wrote that "OnSwordfishtrombones, Waits has made a breakthrough – he's found music as evocative as his words. Waits's grumble of a voice now bounces off a peculiar assortment of horns and percussion and organ and keyboards, as if he'd led a Salvation Army band into a broken-down Hong Kong disco. It's as if he's shifted from monologues to screenplays."[159]According to David Smay,Swordfishtromboneswas "the record where Tom Waits radically reinvented himself and reshaped the musical landscape."[160]NMEnamed it the second best album of the year.[161]In 1989,Spinmagazine named it the second greatest album of all time.[162]
In 1983, Waits appeared in three more Coppola films: as Benny, a philosopher running a billboard store inRumble Fish; as Buck Merrill inThe Outsiders; and as the maître'd inThe Cotton Club.[163]He later said that "Coppola is actually the only film director in Hollywood that has a conscience ... most of them are egomaniacs and money-grabbing bastards".[164]In September, Brennan gave birth to their daughter, Kellesimone.[165]Waits was determined to keep his family life separate from his public image and to spend as much time as possible with his daughter.[166]With Brennan and their child, Waits moved to New York City to be closer to Brennan's parents and Island's U.S. office. They settled into a loft apartment nearUnion Square.[167]
Waits found New York City life frustrating, although it allowed him to meet many new musicians and artists. He befriendedJohn Lurieofthe Lounge Lizards, and the duo began sharing a music studio in the Westbeth artist-community building inGreenwich Village. He began networking in the city's arts scene, and, at a partyJean-Michel Basquiatheld for Lurie, he met the filmmakerJim Jarmusch.[168]
Starting in the mid-80s,Kurt Weillbecame an important influence on Waits's work. Bowman writes that "Waits had become interested in Weill's late-1920s and 1930s musical-theater works ... Weill's slightly off-kilter, stylizedcabaretapproach to melody, rhythm, orchestration, and musical narrative permeated much of Waits's subsequent work."[100]Waits did the soundtrack for the documentaryStreetwise, about homeless youth in Seattle;[169]it was another influence on the subjects of his next album.Rain Dogswas recorded at theRCA Studiosin mid 1985.[170]Musically, Waits called the album "kind of an interaction between Appalachia and Nigeria".[171]Keith Richardsplayed on several tracks;[172]Richards later acknowledged Waits's encouragement of his debut solo album,Talk is Cheap.[173]Rain Dogsalso markedMarc Ribot's debut as a session guitarist; he would play on many subsequent Waits albums.[174]Jean-Baptiste Mondinodirected a music video of "Downtown Train" featuring boxerJake LaMotta. The song was subsequently covered byPatty Smythin 1987, and later byRod Stewart, where it reached the top five in 1990.[175]In 1985,Rolling Stonenamed Waits its "Songwriter of the Year".[176]Arion Berger wrote that "WithRain Dogs, he dropped his bedraggled lounge-piano act and fused outsider influences – socialist decadence by way of Kurt Weill, pre-rock integrity from olddirty blues, the elegiac melancholy ofNew Orleans funeral brass– into a singularly idiosyncratic American style ... The music is bony and menacingly beautiful, the desultory electric-guitar solo as cold as the rattle of marimbas in 'Clap Hands'. The evocative, elliptical rhymes describe scenes and characters with poetic precision but use atmosphere, not narrative, to connect them."[177]NMEnamedRain Dogsthe best album of the year.[178]
In September 1985, his son Casey was born.[179]Waits assembled a band and went on tour, kicking it off in Scotland in October before proceeding around Europe and then the U.S.[180]He changed the setlist for each performance; most of the songs chosen were from his two Island albums.[181]Returning to the U.S., he traveled toNew Orleansto act in Jarmusch'sDown by Law. Jarmusch wroteDown by Lawwith Waits and Lurie in mind.[182]The film opened and closed with songs fromRain Dogs.[183]Jarmusch noted that "Tom and I have a kindred aesthetic. An interest in unambitious people, marginal people."[184]The pair developed a friendship; Waits called Jarmusch "Dr. Sullen", while Jarmusch called Waits "The Prince of Melancholy".[185]
Waits had devised a musical,Franks Wild Years, loosely based on "Frank's Wild Years" fromSwordfishtrombones. In late 1985, he reached an agreement that the play would be performed by theSteppenwolf Theatre CompanyinChicago'sBriar Street Theatre[186]Waits starred as Frank, whom he described as
Quite a guy. Grew up in a bird's eye frozen, oven-ready, rural American town whereBing,Bob,Dean,Wayne&Jerryare considered major constellations. Frank, mistakenly, thinks he can stuff himself into their shorts and present himself to an adoring world. He is a combination ofWill RogersandMark Twain, playing accordion – but without the wisdom they possessed. He has a poet's heart and a boy's sense of wonder with the world. A legend in Rainville since he burned his house down and took off for the Big Time.[187]
Reviews were generally positive. He had initially considered a run in New York City but decided against it.[188]The songs from the show were recorded for his ninth studio album,Franks Wild Years, and released by Island in 1987.[189]NMErankedFranks Wild Yearsfifth on its list of albums of the year.[190]The album was Waits's first collaboration withDavid Hidalgo, who played accordion on "Cold, Cold Ground" and "Train Song". After its release, Waits toured North America and Europe,[191]his last full tour for two decades.[192]Two of these performances were the basis for Chris Blum's concert filmBig Time(1988).[193]
Waits continued interacting and working with other artists he admired. He was a great fan ofthe Poguesand went on a Chicagopub crawlwith them in 1986.[194]The following year, he appeared as amaster of ceremonieson several dates ofElvis Costello's "Wheel of Fortune" tour.[195]
At rehearsals, Tom Waits looked like any moment he might break at the waist or his head fall off his shoulders on to the floor. I once saw a small-town idiot walking across the park, totally drunk, but he was holding an ice-cream, staggering, but also concentrating on not allowing the ice-cream to fall. I felt there was something similar to Tom.
In 1986, he took a small part inCandy Mountain, as millionaire golf enthusiast Al Silk.[197]He costarred inHector Babenco'sIronweed, as Rudy the Kraut.[198]Hoskyns noted thatIronweedput Waits "on the mainstream Hollywood map as a character actor". In Fall 1987, Waits and his family left New York and returned to Los Angeles, settling on Union Avenue.[199]He appeared as a hitman inRobert Dornhelm'sCold Feet[200]and lent his voice to Jarmusch'sMystery Train.[201]
Although Waits had provided a voice-over for a 1981 television advert for Butcher's Blend dog food,[202]he objected to musicians letting companies use their songs in advertising; he said that "artists who take money for ads poison and pervert their songs".[203]In November 1988, he brought a lawsuit againstFrito-Layfor using an impersonator performing "Step Right Up" in an advertisement forDoritos; it came to court in April 1990, and Waits won the case in 1992. He received a $2.6 million settlement, a sum larger than his earnings from all of his previous albums combined.[204]This earned him and Brennan reputations as tireless adversaries.[205]
In 1989, Waits began planning a collaboration withRobert Wilson, a theater director he had known throughout the 1980s. Their project was the "cowboy opera"The Black Rider. It was based on a German folk tale, theFreischütz, which had inspiredCarl Maria von Weber's operaDer Freischütz(1821).[206]In 2004, Waits related that "Wilson is my teacher. There's nobody that's affected me that much as an artist".[207]Waits wrote the music and, at the suggestion ofAllen Ginsberg, Waits and Wilson approachedWilliam S. Burroughsto pen the lyrics. They flew toKansasto meet with Burroughs, who agreed to join the project. Waits traveled toHamburg, Germany, in May 1989 to work on the project, and was later joined there by Burroughs.[208]The Black Riderdebuted in Hamburg'sThalia Theaterin March 1990.[209]On completing its run at the Thalia, the play went on an international tour,[210]with a second run of performances occurring in the mid-2000s.[211]
In June 1989, Waits travelled to London to play aPunch and Judypuppeteer in Ann Guedes's filmBearskin: An Urban Fairytale.[212]He proceeded to Ireland, where he was joined by Brennan and spent time with her family.[213]In December 1989, he began a stint as Curly, a mobster's son, at the Los Angeles Theater Center production ofThomas Babe's playDemon Wine.[214]Over the next four years, he made seven film appearances.[213]He nevertheless repeatedly told press that he did not see himself as an actor, but only as someone who did some acting.[215]He made a brief appearance as a plainclothes cop inThe Two Jakes(1990) and played a disabled war veteran inTerry Gilliam'sThe Fisher King(1991).[216]He had a cameo inSteve Rash'sQueens Logic(1991) and played a pilot-for-hire inHéctor Babenco'sAt Play in the Fields of the Lord(1991).[217][218]He appeared as himself fishing withJohn LurieonFishing with John. He wasRenfieldin Coppola'sBram Stoker's Dracula(1992).[219]Waits starred as Earl Piggot, an alcoholic limousine driver, inRobert Altman'sShort Cuts(1993).[220]Hoskyns said that this "may be the best performance Waits ever gave as an actor."[221]
In 1991, Waits and his family moved to the outskirts ofSonoma.[218]Waits's family later relocated to a secluded house nearValley Fordafter a bypass road was built near to their first Sonoma County house.[222]Also in 1991, 13 of Waits's 1971 pre-Asylum Records recordings were released for the first time on the first volume ofTom Waits: The Early Years. Waits was angered at this, describing many of his early demos as "baby pictures" that he would not want released. A second volume with 13 more recordings from 1971 was released in 1993.[223]In April 1992, Waits released the soundtrack album to Jarmusch'sNight on Earth. Largely instrumental, it had been recorded at the Prairie Sun studio inCotati.[224]In 1992, Waits quit drinking alcohol and joinedAlcoholics Anonymous.[225][226]In the early 1990s he took part in several charitable causes. In 1990 he contributed a song to theHIV/AIDSbenefit albumRed Hot + Blueand later appeared at aWiltern Theaterfundraising show for the victims of the1992 Los Angeles riots.[227]
In August 1992, Waits released his tenth studio album,Bone Machine. Waits wanted to explore "more machinery sounds" with the album, reflecting his interest inindustrial music.[228]It was recorded in an old storage room at Prairie Sun.
Waits recalled: "I found a great room to work in, it's just a cement floor and a hot water heater. Okay, we'll do it here. It's got some good echo."[229]Eight of the album's tracks were co-written with Brennan.[230]The cover was co-designed by Waits andJesse Dylan. Jarmusch and Dylan directed videos for "I Don't Wanna Grow Up", and "Goin' Out West", respectively.[231]Critic Steve Huey called it "perhaps Tom Waits's most cohesive album ... a morbid, sinister nightmare, one that applied the quirks of his experimental '80s classics to stunningly evocative—and often harrowing—effect ... Waits's most affecting and powerful recording, even if it isn't his most accessible."[232]The album's closing track, "That Feel", was co-written withKeith Richards.Bone Machinewon theGrammyforBest Alternative Music Album;[233]in response, Waits asked Jarmusch: "alternative towhat?!"[234]
Waits decided to record an album of the songs written forThe Black Rider, and did so at Los Angeles'sSunset Sound Factory.The Black Riderwas released in the fall of 1993.[235]Waits and Wilson decided to collaborate again, this time on an operatic treatment ofLewis Carroll's relationship withAlice Liddell, who had provided the inspiration forAlice in WonderlandandThrough the Looking Glass.[236]Again scheduled to premier at the Thalia, they began working on the project in Hamburg in early 1992.[237]Waits characterized the songs he wrote for the play as "adult songs for children, or children's songs for adults". In his lyrics, Waits drew on his increasing interest infreak showsand the physically deformed.[238]He thought the play itself was about "repression, mental illness and obsessive, compulsive disorders".[239]Alicepremiered at the Thalia in December 1992.[240]
In early 1993, Brennan was pregnant with Waits's third child, Sullivan.[241]He decided to reduce his workload so as to spend more time with his children; this isolation spawned rumours that he was seriously ill or had separated from his wife. For three years, he turned down all offers to perform gigs or appear in movies.[242]However, he made several cameos and guest appearances on albums by musicians he admired.[243]In February 1996, he held a benefit performance to raise funds for the legal defense of his friend Don Hyde, who had been charged with distributingLSD.[244]He wrote "Walk Away" and "The Fall of Troy" forthe soundtrackofDead Man Walking(1995)[245]and "Little Drop of Poison" forThe End of Violence(1997).[246]In 1998, Island releasedBeautiful Maladies, a compilation of 23 Waits tracks from his albums with the company, selected by Waits himself.[247]
After his contract with Island expired, Waits decided not to try to renew it, particularly as Blackwell had resigned from the company.[248]He signed to a smaller record label,Anti-, recently launched as an offshoot of thepunk-labelEpitaph Records.[249]He described the company as "a friendly place".[250]The president of Anti-,Andy Kaulkin, said the label was "blown away that Tom would even consider us. We are huge fans."[251]Waits himself praised the label: "Epitaph is a label run by and for artists and musicians, where it feels much more like a partnership than a plantation ... We shook on the deal over a coffee in a truck stop. I know it's going to be an adventure."[252]
In March 1999, Anti- releasedMule Variations.[250]Waits had been recording the tracks at Prairie Sun since June 1998.[253]The tracks often dealt with themes involving rural life in the United States and were influenced by the early blues recordings made byAlan Lomax;[254]Waits coined the term "surrural" ("surreal" and "rural") to describe the album's content.[255]Mule Variationsreached number 30 on the U.S. Billboard 200, the highest showing of a Waits album.[256]The album was well received,[250]being named "Album of the Year" byMojo.[257]It won theGrammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album.[258]On the categorization of the album asfolk music, Waits said: "That's not a bad thing to be called if you've got to be in some kind of category."[234]
Also in March 1999, Waits gave his first live show in three years atParamount Theater, Austin, Texasas part of theSouth by Southwestfestival.[259]He subsequently appeared in an episode ofVH1 Storytellers. In the later part of the year he embarked on theMule Variationstour, primarily in the U.S. but also featuring dates in Berlin.[260]In October, he performed atNeil Young's annualBridge School benefitconcert.[261]That year, he appeared inKinka Usher's comic book spoofMystery Menas Dr A. Heller, an eccentric inventor living in an abandoned amusement park.[262]
In 2000, Waits began writing songs for Wilson's adaptation ofGeorg Büchner'sWoyzeck, which had earlier inspiredAlban Berg's operaWozzeck(1925). It was scheduled to start at the Betty Nansen Theater inCopenhagenin November 2000. He initially worked on the songs at home before traveling to Copenhagen for rehearsals in October.[263]Waits stated that he liked the play because it was "a proletariat story  ... about a poor soldier who is manipulated by the government".[264]He decided to then record the songs he had written for bothAliceandWoyzeck, placing them on separate albums. For these recordings, he brought in a range of jazz and avant-garde musicians from San Francisco.[265]The two albums,AliceandBlood Money, were released simultaneously in May 2002.[266]Aliceentered the U.S. album chart at number 32 andBlood Moneyat number 33, his highest charting positions at that time.[267]Waits describedAliceas being "more metaphysical or something, maybe more water, more feminine", whileBlood Moneywas "more earthbound, more carnival, more the slaving meat-wheel that we're all on". Of the two,Alicewas better received by critics.[268]Jesse Dylan directed a video for "God's Away On Business", but shooting was delayed when theemuswho were set to star were eaten by coyotes. PerNME, "Replacements were hastily found and the video for ‘God’s Away On Business’, the single lifted from ‘Blood Money’, one of Waits’ two new albums, went ahead a little late."[269]
In May 2001, Waits accepted a Founders Award at the 18th annualAmerican Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers(ASCAP) Pop Music Awards in a ceremony at Los Angeles'sBeverly Hilton Hotel.[270]That same month, he joined singersNancyandAnn WilsonofHeart, as well asRandy Newman, in launching a $40 million lawsuit againstmp3.comfor copyright infringement.[271]In September 2002, he appeared at a hearing on accounting practices within the music industry in California. There, he expressed satisfaction with Anti- but declared more broadly that "the record companies are like cartels. It's a nightmare to be trapped in one."[272]
In September 2003, Waits performed at the Healing the Divide fundraiser in New York City.[273]He appeared in Jarmusch'sCoffee and Cigarettes(2003), having a conversation withIggy Pop.[274]
In 2004, Waits released his fifteenth studio album,Real Gone.[275]Waits had recorded it in an abandoned schoolhouse inLocke. Hoskyns called the album Waits's "roughest, most unkempt music to date". It incorporated Waitsbeatboxing, a technique he had picked up from his growing interest inhip hop.[276]Humphries characterized it as "the most overtly political album of Waits's career".[277]It featured three political songs expressing Waits's anger at the presidency ofGeorge W. Bushand theIraq War. He said: "I'm not a politician. I keep my mouth shut because I don't want to put my foot in it. But at a certain point, saying absolutely nothing is a political statement of its own."[278]Real Gonereceived largely positive reviews.[279]It made the Billboard Top 30 as well as the Top 10 in several European album charts,[280]also earning him a nomination for Best International Male Solo Artist at the 2005Brit Awards.[281]In October 2004, he launched a tour inVancouverbefore heading to Europe, where his shows were sell-outs:[282]his only London gig saw 78,000 applications for around 3,700 available tickets.[283]Per Bowman, "Much ofReal Gonewas built around oral-percussion home recordings that Waits made in his bathroom, using his mouth as a human beat-box. A superb example is the bed track underpinning the hellacious groove of ‘Metropolitan Glide’ that Waits aptly described as ‘cubist funk.’ In stark contrast, the album's closing track, 'Day After Tomorrow,' returned Waits to his singer-songwriter roots, and features a beautiful melody that sounds eerily similar to Dylan's early acoustic work."[1]
After several years without film appearances, he played a gun-totingSeventh-day AdventistinTony Scott'sDomino(2005).[284]Later that year, he traveled to Italy to appear in Benigni'sThe Tiger and the Snow.[285]He followed this with a performance as an angel posing as a tramp inWristcutters: A Love Story(2007).[286]In the summer of 2006, Waits embarked on his "Orphans" tour of southern and Midwest states. His son Casey played in the band accompanying him on tour.[287]In 2006, he issuedOrphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards, a 54-song three-disc box set of rarities, unreleased tracks and new compositions; Waits described its contents as "songs that fell behind the stove while making dinner." The first disc,Brawlers, consists of raucousrockandblues-based numbers; the second,Bawlers, of melancholiccountrysongs and ballads; the third,Bastards, of stories,spoken wordpieces and other works not so easily categorized.[288]Orphansmade the top ten in several European charts. In 2006, Waits was a guest onThe Daily ShowwithJon Stewart, where he played "Day After Tomorrow".[289]
In January 2008, Waits performed at a benefit for Bet Tzedek Legal Services—The House of Justice, anonprofitpoverty law center, in Los Angeles.[290]That year, Waits embarked on hisGlitter and Doom Tour, starting in the U.S. and moving to Europe. Both of his sons played with him on the tour.[291]At the June concert inEl Paso, Texas, Waits was presented with the key to the city. Approached by a police officer, he said: "I paid all those tickets!" Breaking character, he said: “This is a first for me, a real first.”[292]In 2009, he released the two-discGlitter and Doom Live. He continued acting, playing Mr Nick in Gilliam'sThe Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus(2009)[293][294]and Engineer inThe Book of Eli(2010), apost-apocalypticfilm by theHughes brothers.[295]
Waits found himself in a situation similar to his earlier one with Frito Lay in 2000 whenAudiapproached him, asking to use "Innocent When You Dream" for a commercial broadcast in Spain. Waits declined, but the commercial ultimately featured music very similar to that song. Waits undertook legal action, and a Spanish court recognized that there had been a violation of Waits'smoral rightsin addition to the infringement of copyright. The production company, Tandem Campmany Guasch, was ordered to pay compensation to Waits through his Spanish publisher. Waits later joked that they got the name of the song wrong, thinking it was called "Innocent When You Scheme".[296][297]In 2005, Waits suedAdam Opel AG, claiming that, after having failed to sign him to sing in their Scandinavian commercials, they had hired a sound-alike singer. In 2007, the suit was settled, and Waits gave his proceeds to charity.[298]
In 2010, Waits was reported to be working on a new stage musical with director and long-time collaboratorRobert Wilsonand playwrightMartin McDonagh.[299]
In early 2011, Waits completed a set of 23 poems,Seeds on Hard Ground, which were inspired by Michael O'Brien's portraits of the homeless in his book,Hard Ground. O'Brien's book included the poems alongside the portraits. In anticipation of the book release, Waits andANTI-printed limited edition chapbooks of the poems to raise money for Redwood Empire Food Bank, a homeless referral and family support service inSonoma County, California. As of January 26, 2011, four editions, each limited to 1,000 copies, sold out, raising $90,000 for the food bank.[300]On February 24, 2011, it was announced via Waits's official website that he had begun work on his next studio album.[301]Waits said through his website that on August 23 he would "set the record straight" in regards to rumors of a new release.[302]On August 23, the title of the new album was revealed to beBad as Me,[303]and the lead single and title track started being offered viaAmazon.comand other sites.[304]
In March 2011, Waits was inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of FamebyNeil Young.[305][306][307][308]In his acceptance speech, Waits said: "I’d like to thank my family. They know me and they love me anyway. My wife and her incandescent light that has guided me and kept me alive and breathing and sparkling. And my kids who, well, they taught me everything I know. Or maybe they taught me everything they know. I don’t know. They taught me a lot."[6]
In 2012, Waits had a supporting role in McDonagh's crime comedySeven Psychopathsas a retiredserial killer.[309]In 2013, he lent his voice toThe Simpsonsepisode "Homer Goes to Prep School" as a survivalist.[310]On May 5, 2013, he joinedthe Rolling Stoneson stage at the Oracle Arena in Oakland, California, to duet withMick JaggeronWillie Dixon's "Little Red Rooster".[311]On October 27, 2013, Waits performed at the 27th annualBridge School Benefitconcert in Mountain View California;Rolling Stonecalled his performance a "triumph".[312]
Over the years, Waits made six appearances on theLate Show with David Letterman,[313]and on May 14, 2015, sang "Take One Last Look" on the show's fifth to last broadcast.[314]He was accompanied byLarry Tayloron upright bass and Gabriel Donohue on piano accordion, with the horn section of theCBS Orchestra. In 2016, Waits pursued litigation against French artist Bartabas, who had used several of his songs as a backdrop to a theatrical performance. Claims and counterclaims were made, with Bartabas claiming to have sought and been granted permission to use the material (and to have paid $400,000 for the privilege) but with Waits claiming that his identity had been stolen. The court ruled in Bartabas's favor, and the circus performance was allowed to continue, although the threat of further litigation meant that it was not performed outside France and the resulting DVD release does not contain Waits's material.[315]
In 2018, Waits had a feature role inThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs, aWesternanthology film by theCoen brothers, as the Prospector.[316]Also in 2018, Waits provided the recorded narration for performances of McDonagh's playA Very Very Very Dark Matter, which was performed at theBridge Theatre, London. In 2021, Waits had a supporting role inPaul Thomas Anderson's coming-of-age filmLicorice Pizza.[317]In 2023, he joinedIggy Popon theConfidential Show, where they swapped stories and songs.[318][319]In 2025, he appeared as part of Italian public television channel RAI3’s ‘The Human Factor’ series in the last episode, “The Last Ride”, where he read from his poem, “Seeds On Hard Ground”, and performed part of his song, “The Fall of Troy”.[320][321]
Per Bowman, Waits
has never been of his time, ahead of his time, or, for that matter, locked into any particular time. An outsider artist before the term was in common use, Waits has been enamored, at various points in his career, with the cool of 1940s and 1950sjazz; the 1950s and 1960s word-jazz and poetry of suchBeatand Beat-influenced writers asJack Kerouac,Lord Buckley, andCharles Bukowski; the primalrock & rollcrunch of theRolling Stones; the Germancabaretstylings ofKurt Weill; the postwar, alternate world of invented instruments and rugged individualism ofavant-gardecomposerHarry Partch; the proto-metalbluesof 1950s and 1960sHowlin' Wolfand their extension into the world ofCaptain Beefheart's late-1960savant-rock; the archaic formalism of 19th-centuryparlor ballads;Dylan's early- and mid-sixties transformation of the possibilities of language in the worlds of bothfolkandrock; the elegance of pre-warIrving Berlin,Cole Porter, andHoagy Carmichael; the sophistication of postwarFrank Sinatra; and, more recently, the bone-crushing grooves of 1980s and 1990sfunkandhip-hop. Indeed, the art of Tom Waits has altogether transcended time and, to some degree, place.[1]
Asked about the distinction between words and music, he says: "I'm still a word guy. I'm drawn to people who use a certain vernacular and communicate with words. Words are music, really. I mean, people ask me, 'Do you write music or do you write words?' But you don't really, it's all one thing at its best."[322]His work was influenced by his voracious reading and by conversations that he overheard in diners.[323]In addition to Kerouac and Bukowski, literary influences includeNelson Algren,John RechyandHubert Selby Jr.[324]Bowman notes the influence of crime writers likeDashiell HammettandJohn D. Macdonald.[100]Waits says that "for a songwriter, Dylan is as essential as a hammer and nails and saw are to a carpenter."[21]Musical influences includeRandy Newman[325]andDr. John. He has praisedMerle Haggard: "Want to learn how to write songs? Listen to Merle Haggard."[326][327]He is anoperalover, and recalls hearingPuccini's "Nessun dorma" "in the kitchen at Coppola's withRaul Juliaone night, and it changed my life, that particular Aria... It was like giving a cigar to a five-year old." A jazz influence isThelonious Monk: "He almost sounded like a kid taking piano lessons. I could relate to that when I first started playing the piano, because he was decomposing the music while he was playing it."[21]Regarding his eclectic influences, he says: "I draw from all kinds of sources and I listen to a lot of things ... I would recommend that when you are starting out that you stay with your own stuff and find out who you are. And stay with you mining your own unique qualities rather than trying to sound like somebody else. I mean you do start out like somebody else, and slowly you become yourself, so it's kinda like life, you know?"[106]
Waits described his voice as being "the sand in the sandwich."[328]By 1982, Waits's musical style shifted; Hoskyns noted that this new style "was fashioned out of diverse and disparate ingredients." This new style was influenced by Beefheart and Partch.[148]Noting that he had a "gravelly timbre",[329]Humphries characterized Waits's voice as one that "sounds like it was hauled throughHadesin a dredger."[330]His voice was described by critic Daniel Durchholz as sounding as though "it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months, and then taken outside and run over with a car."[331]Rolling Stonealso noted his "rusted plow-blade voice."[332]One of Waits's own favorite descriptions of his vocal style was "Louis ArmstrongandEthel Mermanmeeting in Hell."[333]Humphries cited him, alongside Newman,Kris KristoffersonandJohn Prine, as a number of U.S. singers who followed Dylan in breaking away from conventional styles of popular music and singing with their "distinctive" voices.[334]Waits can sing infalsetto, as heard on "Shore Leave", "Temptation" and "All Stripped Down". Waits said he couldn't sing in falsetto until after he quit smoking, adding "Nobody does it likeMick Jagger; nobody does it likePrince."[21]
He is known for his eclectic use of instruments, some of his own devising. OnSwordfishtrombones, his orchestration includedtalking drums,bagpipes,banjo,bass marimbaandglass harmonica; onRain Dogs,accordionandharmonium; onFranks Wild Years,glockenspiel,Mellotron,FarfisaandOptigan; onBone MachineandMule Variations, theChamberlin; onThe Black Rider, thesinging saw; onAlice, theStroh violin; onBlood Money, a 57-whistle pneumaticcalliopeand an Indonesian seedpod.[335]He explains "I use things we hear around us all the time, built and found instruments. Things that aren't normally considered instruments: dragging a chair across the floor or hitting the side of a locker real hard with a two-by-four, a freedom bell, a brake drum with a major imperfection, a police bullhorn. It's more interesting. I don't like straight lines. The problem is that most instruments are square and music is always round."[100]As he later put it, "A lot of things are instruments and they don't even know it."[336]
It's like fishing. You just go out there and wait sometimes. That's whatDavid Lynchsaid. He said, "You've gotta have a very comfortable chair, and you have to be very quiet, if you want to catch the big ones."
Humphries described "Waitsworld" as a place of "the ricocheted romantics bent out of shape by a broad who should have known better; the twisted psychotics; the loners; the losers."[338]ByBlue Valentine, violent death had become a recurrent lyrical theme in his work; he wrote the song "Sweet Little Bullet" from that album, for instance, about a 15-year-old girl who committed suicide by jumping from a high window along theHollywood Bowl.[339]"Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis", from the same album, is an epistolary song from a prostitute to her former lover, Charlie; while good-hearted, she is anunreliable narrator. In his later work, orphanhood became a recurring theme.[340]Many of his songs make reference to fictional locations that he has invented, such as the eponymous term in his song "Burma Shave".[341]Hoskyns also noted that many Waits songs, such as "Burma Shave" and "Georgia Lee", reflect an "abiding concern for runaways and kids in danger."[342]Andy Gill expressed the view that throughout Waits's oeuvre, "the theme of lowlife redemption, of escape, is ever-present."[343]
Waits credits his wife with inspiration: "She's an opera buff and bug collector. And she's done a lot of things. And she has dreams likeHieronymus Bosch. She writes more from her dreams, I wrote more from the world, or from the newspaper...And somehow it all works together." He credits her with helping him unify his eclectic musical interests: "it's really my wife that started helping me see that you can find the place whereLead BellyandSchoenbergoverlap."[337]
During the 1970s, Waits had a brief relationship with comedianElayne Boosler,[344]an intermittent relationship withBette Midler,[64]and a relationship withRickie Lee Jones.[90]
In 1980, Waits married frequent collaboratorKathleen Brennan. They live inSonoma County, California,[128]and have three children: Kellesimone Wylder Waits (born 1983),[165]Casey Waits (born 1985),[179]and Sullivan Blake Waits (born 1993).[345][346]After he married and had children, Waits became increasingly reclusive.[347]Safeguarding the privacy of his family life became very important to him.[348]
During interviews, he has deflected questions about his personal life, and refused to sanction any biography.[349]When Barney Hoskyns was researching his unauthorized 2009 biography,Lowside of the Road: A Life of Tom Waits, Waits and his wife asked people not to talk to him. Hoskyns believed that it was Brennan who was responsible for the "wall of inaccessibility" surrounding Waits.[350]
When asked about his religious beliefs, he noted: "With the God stuff I don't know. I don't know what's out there any more than anyone else."[351]
Waits has been determined to keep a distance between his public persona and his personal life.[352]According to Hoskyns, Waits hides behind his persona, noting that "Tom Waits is as much of a character created for his fans as it is a real man."[353]In Hoskyns's view, Waits's self-image is in part "a self-protective device, a screen to deflect attention."[354]A few music journalists have gone so far as to suggest that Waits is a "poseur".[355]Hoskyns regarded Waits's "persona of the skid-row boho/hobo, a young man out of time and place" as an "ongoing experiment in performance art."[356]He added that Waits has adopted a "self-appointed role as the bard of the streets."[357]Mick Brown, a music journalist fromSoundswho interviewed Waits in the mid-1970s, noted that "he had immersed himself in this character to the point where itwasn'tan act and had become an identity."[358]Louie Lista, a friend of Waits's during the 1970s, stated that the singer's general attitude was that of "I'm an outsider, but I'llrevelin being an outsider."[359]In a similar manner to contemporaries like Bob Dylan and Neil Young, Waits is known for cutting contact with figures he worked with in his past.[360]
"There ain't no Devil, there's just God when he's drunk.""I don't have a drinking problem, 'cept when I can't get a drink.""Everybody I like is either dead or not feeling very well.""I'm so broke I can't even pay attention.""You have to keep busy, after all, no dog ever pissed on a moving car.""I don't care who I have to step on on my way down."
Another friend from that period, Troubadour-manager Robert Marchese, related that Waits cultivated "the whole mystique of this really funky dude and all thatCharles Bukowskicrap" to give "his impression of how funky poor folk really are," whereas in reality Waits was "basically a middle-class, San Diego mom-and-pop-schoolteacher kid."[359]Humphries thought that there was a "conservative element" to Waits's persona, stating that behind his public image, "Waits has always been more of a white-picket-fence kind of guy than you might imagine."[362]
Jarmusch described Waits as "a very contradictory character," stating that he is "potentially violent if he thinks someone isscrewingwith him, but he's gentle and kind too."[363]Herbert Hardesty, who worked with Waits onBlue Valentine, called him "a very pleasant human being, a very nice person."[364]Humphries referred to him as "an essentially reticent man ... reflective and surprisingly shy."[365]He has a sense of humor and enjoys jokes.[366]Hoskyns described Waits as "unequivocally—some would say almost gruffly—heterosexual."[367]
Hoskyns suggested that Waits has had an "on-off affair with alcohol, never quite able to shake it off."[368]During the 1970s, he was known as a heavy drinker and a smoker but avoided any drugs harder than cocaine.[369]He told one interviewer, "I discovered alcohol at an early age, and that guided me a lot."[370]Humphries suggested that Waits's use of alcohol as opposed to illicit drugs marked him out as being different from many of his contemporaries on the 1970s U.S. music scene.[371]
During interviews, Waits has avoided questions about his personal life, gone off on tangents, and thrown in trivia.[372]Humphries noted that Waits has often supplied interviewers with "droll one-liners", something he termed "Waitsisms", observing that the singer was "dripping with wit and vinegar."[361]Waits is known for getting irate with journalists.[373]He dislikes touring,[374]but Hoskyns added that Waits has "a strong work ethic".[375]
Per his website's description ofGlitter and Doom Live, "Disc One is designed to sound like one evening's performance, even though the 17 tracks are selected from 10 cities, from Paris to Birmingham; Tulsa to Milan; and Atlanta to Dublin... Disc Two is a bonus compendium called TOM TALES, which is a selection of the comic bromides, strange musings, and unusual facts that Tom traditionally shares with his audience during the piano set. Waits' topics range from the rituals of insects to the last dying breath of Henry Ford." It adds "he shifts seamlessly from an array of characters: carnival barker, preacher, country singer, soul balladeer; cabaret singer and storyteller."[376]
In concert, Waits tended to wear all black. Humphries noted that "on stage, Waits is a consummate performer, a raconteur of the recherché, and a genuine wit."[377]Waits has stated that a performance should be "a spectacle and entertaining".[55]It was on his 1977 tour forForeign Affairsthat he started employing props as part of his routine;[91]one recurring prop was a megaphone through which he would shout at the audience.[283]
Over the years, Waits has collaborated with various artists he admires. He toured with the saxophonistTeddy Edwardsand played on his albumMississippi Lad(1991).Bruce Springsteenperformed"Jersey Girl"with Waits on August 24, 1981, and included it on his retrospective "Live/1975–85".[378]In 1987, he joined Springsteen,Elvis Costello,k. d. langand others in a tribute toRoy Orbisonat Los Angeles's Ambassador Hotel, filmed asRoy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night.[379]Waits and Brennan wrote "Strange Weather" forMarianne Faithfull, which she sang on her albumStrange Weatherin 1987.[380]Keith Richardsplayed onRain Dogs,Bone MachineandBad as Me, and Waits and Richards recorded"Shenandoah"forSon of Rogues Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs & Chanteys(2013). Richards said of Waits: “Tom’s music is so American. Probably more folk-American than anything, but somehow modern. He’s a weird mixture of stuff; a great bunch of guys!"[381]Waits wrote a poem, "Burnt Toast to Keith", for Richards's 80th birthday.[382]Waits coveredKurt Weill’s "What Keeps Mankind Alive?" fromThe Threepenny OperaforHal Willner's Weill tribute albumLost in the Stars(1985) and "Heigh Ho" for hisDisney-themedStay Awake(1988).[383]In 1991, he lent his voice to "Tommy the Cat" byPrimus, and they appeared onBone MachineandMule Variations. Waits and Primus performedJack Kerouac's song "On the Road" onJack Kerouac Reads On the Road(1999).[384]The English composerGavin Bryarsvisited Waits in 1993, and he added vocals to a re-release of Bryars'sJesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet,[385]which was nominated for theMercury Music Award.[386]He sang withRamblin' Jack Elliotton "Louise (Tell It To Me)" on his albumFriends of Mine(1998). That year, Waits produced and fundedChuck E. Weiss's albumExtremely Coolas a favor to his old friend.[387]He producedJohn P. Hammond'sWicked Grin(2001) which consisted largely of covers of Waits songs, some written for the project.[388]He covered "Return of Jackie & Judy" forWe're a Happy Family: A Tribute to Ramones(2003).[389]He appeared onLos Lobos'sThe Ride(2004),Eels'sBlinking Lights and Other Revelations(2005)[390]andSparklehorse'sDreamt for Light Years in the Belly of a Mountain(2006).[391]Ken Nordine, whose "word jazz" influenced Waits, performed "Circus" for a video with animation byJoe Coleman.[392]Waits was one of many guests onDan Hicks'sBeatin' the Heat(2000). Hicks recalled: "I made a list of people I thought were in a mutual admiration society. Most of the people, I found their phone numbers and called them. Tom Waits said he didn't want to miss out on something like this. That was a pretty good compliment."[393]
Bowman writes that "At the dawn of the second decade of the 21st century, Waits’s influence can be seen in the work of many of the most forward-thinking contemporary artists, includingBeck,PJ Harvey, andRadiohead’sThom Yorke.”[100]Other musicians who have expressed admiration for Waits's work includeElvis Costello,[394]Bruce Springsteen,[394]Nanci Griffith,[394]Joe Strummerofthe Clash,[395]Michael StipeofR.E.M.,[394]Frank BlackofPixies[396]andJames HetfieldofMetallica.[395]Bob Dylan, a major influence on the young Waits, called Waits one of his "secret heroes".[397]Humphries described him as "one of America's finest post-Dylan singer-songwriters" and, along withEdward Hopper, "one of the two great depicters of American isolation."[398]Hoskyns called him "as important an American artist as anyone the twentieth century has produced."[399][400]He notes that by the end of the twentieth century, "Waits was an iconic alternative figure, not just to the fans who'd grown up with him but to subsequent generations of music geeks",[401]coming to be "universally acknowledged as an elder statesman of 'alternative' rock.'"[402]Karen Schoemer ofNewsweeksaid that "to the postboomer generation, he's more Dylan than Dylan. [His] melting-pot approach toAmericana, his brilliant narratives and his hardiness against commercial trends have made him the ultimate icon for the alternative-minded."[401]Steve Vaisaid: "Tom Waits is my favorite artist now. I completely resonate deeply with his music, his voice and his lyrics; I buy everything he ever does. He's one of those guys who are totally at one with the creative element with no excuses or concerns about what's going on around him – totally uncompromising."[403]When asked which song she wished she had written,Florence WelchofFlorence and the Machinesaid: “‘Green Grass’ by Tom Waits.... Really, anything by Tom Waits. I wish I was Tom Waits. His songs are so visceral and bloody. I just love his use of imagery."[404]Bones Howesays: "I do a lot of seminars. Occasionally I'll do something for songwriters. They all say the same thing to me. 'All the great lyrics are done.' And I say, 'I'm going to give you a lyric that you never heard before'", the following from "Tom Traubert's Blues": "A battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace / And a wound that will never heal." Howe calls this "the work of an extremely talented lyricist, poet, whatever you want to say. That is brilliant, brilliant work. And he never mentions the person, but you see the person."[405]
He was included onRolling Stone's lists of 100 Greatest Singers[406]and100 Greatest Songwriters. In 2006, Waits and Brennan were ranked fourth onPaste's list of the hundred greatest living songwriters.[407]In 2016, Waits and Brennan, along withJohn Prine, were honored withThe Song Lyrics of Literary Excellence AwardfromPEN New England.[408]Colum McCannpresented the honor to Waits and Brennan, saying “They find out what others have not quite fathomed yet. They catch the ordinary so that it can be sung extraordinarily in the future.”[409]
I've seen him standing in a bunch of dust, and I thought I saw sparkly things coming off of him. I looked at him when he was singing and I said, "Is my vision going? I'm seeing three, maybe four people up there?" And they all seem to be waiting for the other one to finish so that they come in. And then this other one would justwhistleat me. And then one would speak in a kind of speaking-in-tongues kind of voice. And then The Eagles covered it.
Various artists have covered his songs. In 1973,Tim Buckleycovered "Martha", just likeMeat Loafdid in 1995.The Eaglescovered "Ol' 55" andDioncovered "Heart of Saturday Night" and "San Diego Serenade".[410]Rod Stewarthad success with covers of "Downtown Train" and "Tom Traubert's Blues";[411]Bob Segercovered "Blind Love", "New Coat of Paint", and "Downtown Train".[412][413][414]Paul Youngcovered "Soldier's Things" onThe Secret of Association(1985) and theRamonescovered "I Don't Wanna Grow Up" on their final album,¡Adios Amigos!(1995).[389]Johnny Cashsang "Down There by the Train", which Waits wrote for him, onAmerican Recordings(1994), calling Waits "a very special writer, my kind of writer."[415]Tori Amoscovered"Time"onStrange Little Girls(2001); she performed it on theLate Show With David Letterman, the first musical performance on the show after9/11.[416]Willie Nelsoncovered "Picture in a Frame" onIt Always Will Be(2004).Holly Colereleased an album of Waits covers,Temptation(1995),[417]as didScarlett JohanssonwithAnywhere I Lay My Head(2008).[418]Neko Caseperformed "Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis" on the tribute albumNew Coat of Paint(2000).[419]Norah Jonesincluded a song Waits wrote for her, "Long Way Home", on her albumFeels Like Home(2004).[413][420]Joan Baezcovered his songs onDay After Tomorrow(2008) andWhistle Down the Wind(2018).Rosanne Cash,Aimee Mann,Phoebe Bridgersand others contributed toCome On Up to the House: Women Sing Waits(2019).[421]
Waits has influenced artists in other fields.Kazuo Ishigurorecalls how Waits influenced his novelThe Remains of the Day:
I thought I’d finishedRemains, but then one evening heard Tom Waits singing his song "Ruby’s Arms". It’s a ballad about a soldier leaving his lover sleeping in the early hours to go away on a train. Nothing unusual in that. But the song is sung in the voice of a rough American hobo type utterly unaccustomed to wearing his emotions on his sleeve. And there comes a moment, when the singer declares his heart is breaking, that’s almost unbearably moving because of the tension between the sentiment itself and the huge resistance that’s obviously been overcome to utter it. Waits sings the line with cathartic magnificence, and you feel a lifetime of tough-guy stoicism crumbling in the face of overwhelming sadness. I heard this and reversed a decision I’d made, that Stevens would remain emotionally buttoned up right to the bitter end. I decided that at just one point – which I’d have to choose very carefully – his rigid defence would crack, and a hitherto concealed tragic romanticism would be glimpsed.[422]
Another author who notes Waits's influence isIan Rankin:
I already knew Tom Waits’s music, those soulful communications from the louche underbelly of the American dream, but nothing had prepared me forSwordfishtrombones.I first heard it on a friend’s stereo system, the pair of us transfixed by what was happening in front of our ears. It felt to me as if a vaudeville show was taking place in a scrapyard, the music whirling and clanging, Waits presiding over it all like a bruised but keen-eyed master of ceremonies.Rain Dogsadded extra textures and refinements, laying its (marked) cards on the table with its opening track, "Singapore", a novel contained within two and a half minutes of controlled musical mayhem. By the time of its release I had left university and was trying to shape myself into a writer. I admired Waits’s lyrical vision and concision – the man was a born storyteller, stopping travellers who had wandered into the wrong part of town and compelling them with his words.[423]
His songs have been used in film, television and theater. When the actorRobert Carlyleformed a theatre, he named it the Rain Dog Theatre after Waits's album.[396]Cabaretshows have been set to his songs, among them Robert Berdahl'sWarm Beer, Cold Womenand Stewart D'Arrietta'sBelly of a Drunken Piano.[402]In addition to scoring films for Bell, Coppola and Jarmusch, Waits has written songs for soundtracks: "Never Let Go" forAmerican Heart; "Walk Away" and "The Fall of Troy" forDead Man Walkingand "Little Drop of Poison" forThe End of Violence, which later appeared inShrek 2. "Temptation" and "Cold Cold Ground" appear inLéolo;"Innocent When You Dream"inSmoke; "Goin' Out West" inFight Club;[424]"All The World is Green" and "Green Grass" inThe Diving Bell and the Butterfly.[425]Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Roomfeatures "What's He Building?", "Straight to the Top (Vegas)", "Temptation" and "God's Away on Business".[426]The titles of the filmsRomeo Is BleedingandBlue Valentineare derived from Waits songs. "Hold On" and "I Don't Wanna Grow Up" were sung byBeth Greene(Emily Kinney) inThe Walking Deadepisodes "I Ain't a Judas" and "Infected", respectively.[427][428]The Wireused "Way Down in the Hole" as its opening theme; each season featured a different rendition, includingthe Blind Boys of Alabama, Waits,the Neville Brothers, DoMaJe andSteve Earle. The season four rendition was arranged and recorded for the show and is performed by five Baltimore teenagers: Ivan Ashford, Markel Steele, Cameron Brown, Tariq Al-Sabir and Avery Bargasse.[429]In 2014,Aaron Posnerand the magicianTellerdirected a production ofShakespeare'sThe Tempestfeaturing songs by Waits and Brennan.[430][431][432]

Pulgasariis an epicmonster filmdirected and produced byShin Sang-ok(pictured)duringhis abduction in North Korea. Filmed in 1985 as a co-production between North Korea, Japan, and China, it is supposedly a remake ofa lost 1962 South Korean film.

Intended to capitalize on the success ofThe Return of Godzilla(1984),Pulgasariwas Shin's seventh and final film forKim Jong Il, whose agents kidnapped Shin andChoi Eun-heein 1978.
