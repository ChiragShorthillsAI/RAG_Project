In the fictional city of Bulwark, recentparoleeHenry Johns chastises his mother for returning to prostitution and taking drugs, before reuniting with his handicapped younger brother Ethan.
Three weeks later, police detectives Brett Ridgeman and Anthony Lurasetti are suspended without pay by the police department after a video surfaced revealing them committingpolice brutalityon a drug dealer. Both detectives are desperate for money, with Ridgeman needing cash to move to a safer neighborhood for his family, while Lurasetti stalls in proposing to his girlfriend Denise. On a tip from Friedrich, a wealthy businessman with criminal connections, Ridgeman recruits Lurasetti to help him surveil and rob Lorentz Vogelmann, a professional thief.
Vogelmann commits a series of violent robberies to pay for a customized bulletproof van. Henry and his childhood friend Biscuit are then hired by Vogelmann asgetaway driversfor a bank robbery in which Vogelmann and his crew - Grey Gloves and Black Gloves - take employees and customers as hostages. A bank employee, Kelly Summer, who came back to work from hermaternity leave, is executed by the bank robbers after preventing a colleague from notifying the police via email. The thievescastratethe bank manager and then escape with thebullionand a hostage, Cheryl, while being tailed by Ridgeman and Lurasetti, which Henry notices. Unsettled by Vogelmann and his henchmen's brutality, Henry and Biscuit are then forced to surrender their weapons. Realizing they may be killed, Henry chooses not to reveal to Biscuit or the thieves that they are being followed by the detectives. Lurasetti learns of the atrocities committed by the thieves and berates Ridgeman for not intervening sooner or notifying the authorities, but Ridgeman asserts that law enforcement would be too late, and only the two of them can deal with the thieves. Lurasetti opts against delaying his marriage proposal to Denise and leaves her a voicemail guiding her to the engagement ring.
Arriving at a garage in the countryside, Biscuit leaps out of the van and is shot, as Henry wounds Grey Gloves with a hidden gun. Mortally wounded, Biscuit swallows the van's key, imploring Henry to take care of his mother, and is shot dead by the thieves. Cheryl is sent to pull Biscuit's body into the van and Black Gloves cuts the key out of Biscuit's stomach, as Ridgeman and Lurasetti arrive and ram the van, knocking it over. Cheryl is coerced by Vogelmann into faking an escape that lets her shoot Lurasetti, and she is executed by Ridgeman in turn. Ridgeman then quickly kills Black Gloves as he exits the van. Ridgeman hands the dying Lurasetti his phone and Lurasetti listens to a voicemail from Denise, declining his proposal, before he succumbs to his wounds.
Ridgeman fills the van withtear gas, and kills Grey Gloves just as he surrenders. Before Ridgeman can torch the van, Henry fires a warning shot and insists that the valuable contents of the van be spared. Ridgeman climbs on top of the van and kills Vogelmann before the latter can shoot him through the retractable slit. Henry shoots Ridgeman in the foot and reveals that he has recorded the entire incident on his cellphone and identifies Ridgeman as a detective. Disarming Henry, Ridgeman proposes they split the score, and together they load the bodies and the bullion in the getaway car. After towing Lurasetti's car to a dump site, Ridgeman reveals a hidden firearm and threatens Henry to get him to delete the video. Henry and Ridgeman both shoot at each other, with Henry mortally wounding Ridgeman. Henry agrees with the dying Ridgeman to bury Lurasetti and take care of Ridgeman's family, and later buries all the bodies, promising the deceased Biscuit that he will return and give a proper burial to his friend and the two detectives.
Eleven months later, Henry lives in a lavish mansion with his mother and brother. He sends Ridgeman's family a package containing a share of the gold bullion.
On February 1, 2017, right after finishing production of his previous filmBrawl in Cell Block 99,S. Craig Zahlersigned to directDragged Across Concrete, a crime thriller based onpolice brutality, from a screenplay he had written.[11][12]The script is 162 pages long and remained unchanged at the time of filming, and was Zahler's favorite screenplay to write.[11]The story is influenced from the filmThe Killingdirected byStanley Kubrickand the filmsDog Day AfternoonandPrince of the Citydirected bySidney Lumet,Prince of the Citybeing one of Zahler's favorite films.[11]
Zahler states: "I’m aware there are lines and moments in my films and books and future movies that will land poorly for some people or get people to hate me. That is your right. I have a right to do my own vision and hope it’s enough to get me to the next one."[5]In an interview withThe Daily Beast, Zahler states that the intent of the film is not to address societal ills or invoke a provocation, but to explore "splitting hairs in terms of what the difference is" between the societal issues.[13]Zahler exemplifies Brett Ridgeman, one of the characters in the film, is "an embittered guy, not really happy with his station in life, and with a heavy hand, and doing some stuff that he shouldn’t be doing, and he’s suspended" and trying to get himself out of the hole that he dug with all of these mistakes.[13]Vince Vaughn, who plays Brett's partner Anthony Lurasetti, states thatDragged Across Concreteis "not an agenda movie" but a morality tale.[14]
Dragged Across Concretehasslice of lifescenes not related to the plot progression, such asJennifer Carpenter'scharacter Kelly Summer not wanting to leave her child for work, Vince Vaughn's character Anthony Lurasetti eating a sandwich in a car, andTory Kittles'character Henry Johns talking toMichael Jai White'scharacter "Biscuit" about their childhoods, and are some of Zahler's favorite scenes in the film.[11]Despite these scenes taking a lot of the running time in the film, Zahler believes that coupled with the atmosphere and the subsequent twists, the scenes result in the characters becoming more interesting than the plot.[11]
Keith Kjarval of Unified Pictures produced the film along with Zahler andDallas SonnierofCinestate, Assemble Media's Jack Heller, and Sefton Fincham of Look to the Sky Films, with Kjarval's Unified Film Fund financing.[12]The project sought a distributor at the European Film Market at the67th Berlin International Film Festivalin February 2017.[7]In May 2017,Lionsgateacquired the US distribution rights to the film, and would release it through its subsidiary,Summit Entertainment.[15]
Vince Vaughn starred in S. Craig Zahler's previous filmBrawl in Cell Block 99as the lead character Bradley Thomas. Vaughn gave the script ofDragged Across ConcretetoMel Gibson, who worked with Vaughn in the 2016 filmHacksaw Ridgeas the film director, asking him to star in the film and recommended him to watchBrawl in Cell Block 99.[14]Zahler was able to contact Gibson through Vaughn and hoped that he would star in the film.[12][16]On February 1, 2017, Gibson signed on to the film, with he and Vaughn starring as police officers that are suspended due to committingpolice brutality.[8]
On August 2, 2017,Jennifer CarpenterandDon Johnson, who had worked with Zahler inBrawl in Cell Block 99, signed onto the film, followed byTory Kittles,Michael Jai White,Tattiawna Jones, andLaurie Holden.[8]Since Vaughn and Gibson are both well-knownconservativesin Hollywood,The Daily Beastclaimed this may hinder the financing of the film. However, Zahler believes they are the perfect match for their respective roles, and the studio was willing to fund the film's production after Vaughn and Gibson's casting.[13]Zahler praised Gibson for his collaboration and acting in the film. Gibson previously played a police sergeant in theLethal Weaponfranchise but the films had no bearing on the script nor the casting changes ofDragged Across Concrete.[13]
Principal photographyon the film began inVancouver, British Columbia on July 17, 2017[15][17][18]and wrapped on September 16, 2017.[19]Zahler wantedDragged Across Concreteto be seen as realistic by the audience, filming an actual car collision on set for one of the scenes rather than supplemented in the editing room.[20]Shooting of the film was extremely challenging due to complex and dangerous stunts when filming a broken window, a car crash, or someone being shot.[20]Dragged Across Concreteis less violent than Zahler's previous filmsBone TomahawkandBrawl in Cell Block 99due to the difference in weapons and fighting styles utilized by the characters.[8]
The film's soundtrack was composed byS. Craig Zahlerand his friend Jeff Herriott, having previously worked together inBone TomahawkandBrawl in Cell Block 99. The duo wrote severalsoulpieces and recruiting therhythm and bluesgroupThe O'Jaysto sing the songs.[21][22]Zahler was influenced by jazz musicians such asCharles MingusandJohn Coltranein creating the soundtrack.[21]
Lakeshore Recordsreleased the soundtrack on March 22, 2019, inCD,digital, andvinylformats, which coincided with the release date of the film.[23]Pat Padua ofThe Washington Postcalled some of the music pieces "slightly jarring, but they contribute to a sense of reality that is at once familiar and unsettling."[21]
In May 2017,Lionsgate Filmsacquired the US distribution rights to the film, and would release it through its subsidiary,Summit Entertainment.[15]The film'sworld premierewas at the75th Venice International Film Festivalon September 3, 2018.[24]Dragged Across Concretewas then given a theatrical andvideo on demandrelease in the United States on March 22, 2019.[5][25][26]
Dragged Across Concretewas released ondigital download,DVDandBlu-raydisc in the United States underLionsgate Filmson April 30, 2019, including two special features, a short featurette titled "Moral Conflict: Creating Cinema That Challenges" and a forty-minute 3-part featurette, "Elements of a Crime".[27][28]Studio Canalreleased it in the UK on August 19, 2019, across all three formats.[29]
Dragged Across Concretereceived positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, with praise directed towards Gibson's performance, worldbuilding, and the dark themes and criticism directed towards the runtime and excessive violence. Reception was more polarized on the film's treatment of racism and police brutality.[11][3][30][31]
Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes,Dragged Across Concreteholds an approval rating of 76% based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website's consensus reads, "As grim and grinding as its title,Dragged Across Concreteopts for slow-burning drama instead of high-speed thrills — and has just the right cast to make it work."[32]OnMetacritic, the film has an average score of 60 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[33]
Kevin MaherofThe Timesgave the film four out of five stars, writing: "in this new, bleak and often unexpectedly grand genre movie (it’s essentially abuddy copflick, but with operatic ambitions), the thread out of place, both irritably scratching and strangely arresting, is Mel Gibson."[34]
Peter BradshawofThe Guardianalso ratedDragged Across Concretefour out of five stars, stating: "this is a long film, but there is something so horribly compelling about its unhurried slouch towards the precipice."[35]
David Fear ofRolling Stoneawarded the film a three and a half out of five stars, praising Gibson's performance and the world-building: "Dragged Across Concreteis apt to send crime-film fanatics, especially ones who prefer their pulp nasty, brutish and incredibly long, into frothing fits of glee."[36]
Kieran Fisher ofFilm School Rejectspraised the dialogue interactions between the detectives, Kittles' performance, and Zahler's intention to challenge the moral position of the audience, while acknowledging that the film will attract controversy: "Still, if you just want to see a great crime epic that cares more about telling a great story than promoting an agenda, you’ll want to check outDragged Across Concrete. It’s going to be a contender for the best of 2019 when it’s all said and done, even if some viewers will feel guilty about enjoying it so much."[37]
Armond WhiteofNational Reviewpraised it as a conservative action film, writing that it "vividly conveys the feeling of suffering, bitterness, and struggle";[38]later rating it among the 20best films of the decade.[39]
At the40th Golden Raspberry Awards,Dragged Across Concretewas nominated in a new category, "Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property."[40][41]WhatCulturecriticized the nomination, saying that it "feels  as though voters just wanted to nominateJokerfor the enormous social media publicity it would generate, and then shaped a dubious awards category around it.Dragged Across Concreteis an even weirder pick, though, both because of its low-budget nature and the fact that there's not that much carnage in it.Michael Bay's6 Undergroundis clearly a far worthier nominee than either of those films, given how much obvious human collateral damage is racked up amid the chaotic action sequences."[42]
