When a cocaine shipment is compromised to the dismay of the business's masterminds, a chain of events is set in motion to understand the root of the problem. The Cook and The Man are entrusted with the mission to track the supply chain and identify the point of failure.
As they trace the journey of the drugs, moving from the fields to the processing facilities, and then crossing borders to reach the distributors, they encounter numerous obstacles. The Cook, known for his meticulous nature, is a high-ranking operative, while The Man, a veteran trafficker, brings his streetwise tactics to the operation. Along the way, they cross paths with a host of characters representing different facets of the drug trade – from farmers to brokers, and from dealers to enforcers.
As they move closer to discovering the truth, the duo finds themselves navigating a world filled with greed, betrayal, and extreme danger. The labyrinthine network of the drug trade exposes them to the harsh realities of this underground world, where loyalty is scarce and life is cheap.
The DEA, under the charge of Agent in Charge and her right hand known as The Sniper, are concurrently conducting an operation to bring down this drug cartel. This puts them on a collision course with The Cook and The Man, setting the stage for a tense and potentially explosive confrontation.
As the net tightens around the various players involved in the drug trade, a tale of survival unfolds, with individuals caught in the crossfire attempting to protect their own interests. In a world where lines between good and evil are often blurred, a race against time ensues, with everyone trying to salvage what they can before the inevitable showdown.
