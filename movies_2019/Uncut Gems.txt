The film was chosen by theNational Board of Reviewas one of thetop ten films of 2019.
In May 2012, Howard Ratner runs the KMH jewelry store in New York City'sDiamond District. Although Howard has a well-paying job, his habits are even more expensive. He has agambling addiction, a fancy house onLong Islandfor his wife Dinah, apied-à-terreapartment inManhattanfor his mistress Julia, and a swimming pool that needs resurfacing. Dinah is fed up with his antics and plans to divorce him afterPassover.
Howard has borrowed $100,000 from Arno, aloan shark, which he has used to purchase a 600-caratblack opalfrom Ethiopia'sWelomine, which he has smuggled to America. Arno sends two hired goons, Phil and Nico, to accost him at his shop over the money owed to him. Howard attempts to extend Arno's deadline to Monday, when the opal is set for auction, as Howard believes it can be sold for as high as $1 million.
Howard's business associate Demany brings basketball starKevin Garnettto KMH. Garnett becomes enamored by the opal and believes it will bring him good luck at hisplayoff game that night. He promises to give the opal back that night, giving Howard his2008NBA Championship ringas collateral. Howard quickly pawns the ring to feed his gambling addiction. He places a six-wayparlayworth $600,000, betting that Garnett will play well.[a]Garnett dominates. However, he angers Howard by keeping the opal.
The following evening, Howard is ambushed at his daughter's school play by Arno, Phil, and Nico. Arno tells him that he stopped the bet and lectures him about his reckless spending. The loan sharks strip Howard naked and lock him in the trunk of his car, forcing him to call Dinah for help.
Howard meets Demany at a nightclub party hosted by R&B singerthe Weekndto retrieve the opal, only to find that Garnett still has it. Howard catches Julia with the Weeknd in the club bathroom and believes they were having sex. He fights the Weeknd and orders Julia to leave his apartment.
Garnett returns the opal to Howard and resolves to buy it at the upcoming auction. He asks for his ring back, but Howard lies that he left it at home. Later, Howard berates Demany for allowing Garnett to hold onto the opal for so long. Enraged, Demany trashes Howard's office and poisons his fish tank. After an awkward Passover family dinner, where it is revealed that Arno is Howard's brother-in-law, Dinah rejects Howard's plea to give their marriage another chance.
The auction house shocks Howard by valuing the opal at just $155,000. To salvage the situation, Howard tries to scam Garnett by recruiting his father-in-law Gooey to submit fake bids to drive up the price. Gooey bids up Garnett to $180,000, but Howard greedily pushes for more, prompting Garnett to back out. Enraged by Howard's bungling, Arno, Phil, and Nico assault him outside the auction house.
Howard returns to KMH, bloody, hopeless, and in tears. Julia comforts him and they reconcile. He retrieves Garnett's ring from the pawn shop but is late, and forced to exchange his prized1973 Knicksring for it. Garnett visits KMH to pick up the ring and confront Howard about his auction scheme. Howard explains that he has an emotional need to chase the next big score. He is already planning his next big bet, and uses the confrontation to motivate Garnett to dominate the next game.
Garnett pays Howard $165,000 for the opal, but once again, Howard gambles the money on a speculative Garnett-focused parlay instead of clearing his debts.[b]To prevent the bet, Arno, Phil, and Nico visit KMH to threaten Howard. Howard recruits Julia to sneak out the cash and place the bet at theMohegan Suncasino.[c]He then traps the loan sharks inside the store'ssecurity doorsand forces them to watch the game with him.
Garnett comes through again, earning Howard $1.2 million. Ecstatic, Howard frees Arno and his men, but an enraged Phil kills Howard and Arno, and begins looting the store with Nico. Julia collects Howard's winnings, while Dinah calls the police, suspecting something is amiss.
John Amos,Ca$h Out, andTrinidad Jamesappear as themselves, with Amos appearing as Howard's neighbor and the others as acquaintances of Demany.[9]Tilda SwintonandNatasha Lyonnehave vocal cameos as the auction manager and a Celtics staff member, respectively.[10]Celtics head coachDoc Riverswrote and delivered a voiceover pep talk for the film.[11]Pom Klementieffhas a brief cameo as Lexis, a friend of Julia who greets Howard outside his Manhattan apartment during the opening credits.
Josh and Benny Safdiecame up with the idea of a Diamond District movie in 2009, influenced by their father's stories of working as a diamond salesman.[12][13][14]Co-writerRonald Bronsteincame from a similar background, as his father worked in theGarment District.[15]Their shared Jewish upbringing was essential to their crafting of the film. The Safdies explained that "the film is about belonging," but it is also "about cheating God."[14]Slatecalled the film "the most Jewish movie in years."[16]IndieWire's David Ehrlich quipped that "Uncut Gemsis the movie that Jews were promised in the Torah.Uncut Gemsis gonna be the theme of my son's bar mitzvah."[17]
The question that everyone had about this movie before it even came out is whether it’s antisemitic to make a movie about a crooked Jewish diamond dealer. The assumption built into that question is that the diamond dealer is a symbol of the wealthy Jew. But what we see in this movie is that he’s a symbol of the working-class Jew, the desperate Jew. Maybe he’s not meaningfully working-class in terms of his place in the American economy, but he is culturally marked as working-class, and that is what’s actually embarrassing about it.
— Ari Brostoff[18]
When creating the character of Howard, the Safdies were heavily influenced by Jewish humor and actors from the 20th century. Howard has been likened to aschlimazel, a stock Jewish humor character marked by his poor luck,[19][20]or aschlemiel, marked by his ineptitude and clumsiness,[18][21]although theVillage Voice'sJ. Hobermanargued that Howard's shamelessness precludes the latter comparison.[22]Indeed, the Safdies wanted Howard to encompass Jewish stereotypes proudly and to treat them as a "superpower," adding that "it was very important to make Howard a strong guy who doesn't back down."[16]Josh Safdie explained that one of his goals was to "prov[e] that people can look beyond a flaw. ... That's why the movie is called 'Uncut Gems.' Uncut gems are rough things that are considered ugly by most people, but when you scope them out and get underneath you can find the beauty and value in them."[23]
The Jewish concept of "learning through suffering" was also important for the character throughout the story.[16]In a round-table hosted byJewish Currents, David Klion argued that "the overriding effect that the movie seems to have on virtually everyone who sees it is one of intense anxiety, which feels like a very Jewish theme."[18]Arielle Angelnoted that Howard embodies a combination of "insecurity plus power," and that Howard's Jewishness leaves him "white enough to have access," while still leaving him "with this immigrant hustler mentality."[18]
The Safdies designed Howard's character to channel Jewish "stereotypes that were forced onto us in the Middle Ages, when ... [Jews'] only way of accruing status as an individual, as a person who was considered a human being, was through material consumption."[16]Production designer Sam Lisenco worked with the Safdies to draw a picture of a new-money striver who, despite his wealth, retains the trashy tastes of his childhood. Lisenco noted that Howard insists on buying expensive-but-dated items that he could not afford when he was younger, like theSony Trinitrontelevision in his Manhattan apartment, floor-to-ceiling mirrors, and large fish tanks.The Ringer's Katie Baker described the overall effect as "a study in tackymidtownishentropy."[15]
In May 2016, it was announced that the Safdies were going to direct the film from a screenplay they wrote alongside Bronstein,[24]and that the Safdies' companyElara Picturesand RT Features would produce, withEmma Tillinger KoskoffandMartin Scorseseserving as executive producers.[24]In May 2017, the Safdies announced thatScott Rudin,Eli Bush, and Sebastian Bear-McClard would produce the film, andA24would distribute it.[1]Netflixacquired the international distribution rights.[25]
The Safdies initially approachedAdam Sandlerto star in 2010 and 2015,[14][26]but Sandler's manager rejected the script before Sandler got a chance to read it.[27]Once Scorsese agreed to executive produce the film, actors started taking the film more seriously.[14][26]Jonah Hillwas cast as Howard in May 2017, but dropped out to directMid90s.[27]In April 2018, Sandler finally agreed to play Howard after watching the Safdies' filmGood Time.[26][28]Other actors considered for the role includedSacha Baron Cohen,Harvey Keitel, andJames Caan.[26][29]
Eric Bogosian,Judd Hirsch,LaKeith Stanfield, andIdina Menzeljoined the project in August and September 2018.[30][31][25][32]Three hundred actresses auditioned for the role of Julia, and the names ofLady Gaga,Jennifer Lawrence,Scarlett Johansson, andKim Kardashianwere thrown around; but the role eventually went toJulia Fox.[33]
For the role of the basketball player,Kevin Garnettwas cast in September 2018.[34]Kobe Bryant,Amar'e Stoudemire, andJoel Embiidwere also considered for Garnett's role.[34]The Safdies had originally written the part with Bryant in mind, and planned to focus the game on the day that Bryant broke theMadison Square Gardensingle-game scoring record.[11][35]However, Bryant's agent said that Bryant was only interested in directing.[36]They were also drawn to Stoudemire due to his joint black and Jewish heritage, as well as his years starring with theNew York Knicks, the Safdies' favorite basketball team.[16][37](Josh Safdie joked that "There's a strong correlation with Judaism and Knicks basketball ... it has to do with suffering and trying to understand your life."[37]) However, Stoudemire refused to shave his head to mirror his Knicks-era look.[26]Embiid initially agreed to join the film, but he was forced to drop out when the Safdies moved filming to the basketball season.[37]The Safdies began to look at retired players, and settled on Garnett, even though Garnett's Celtics and the Knicks havea historic rivalry.[38]
In October 2018, it was revealed thatthe Weeknd,Trinidad James, andPom Klementieffhad joined the cast.[39]The Weeknd specifically requested to play the role as an egotistical punk, admitting that that was how he treated people in 2012.[7]Klementieff's scenes, apart from a brief cameo during the opening credits, were removed from the final film.
Principal photographybegan on September 25, 2018, inNew York City,[40]and concluded on November 15.[41]The film was shot byDarius Khondji, primarily on35 mm film, using vintageanamorphicprime andlongzoom lenses. Night sequences were filmed using theArri Alexa Minicamera outfitted with the same pairing of lens types.[42][43]O'Kiep,South Africadoubled as the Welo mine in Ethiopia, but real Ethiopians were cast as extras.[16]For verisimilitude, the filmmakers borrowed real footage from Garnett's NBA games, assuming that it qualified asfair use.[11]
The opening and closing sequences were inspired by the gemologicalphotomicrographyofEduard Gübelinand Danny J. Sanchez.[44][45]
Daniel Lopatincomposed the film'soriginal score.[46]He also recorded several songs withthe Weekndfor the film, but they went unused; however, he has production credits on the Weeknd's 2020 album,After Hours.[47]Asoundtrack albumof Lopatin's music for the film was released on December 13, 2019, onCD,vinyl, and digital streaming services.[48]

The Criterion Collectionacquired the rights to distribute the film on home video, and issued a physical release in 2021.[55]Although Criterion normally re-releases classic films, it sometimes acquires contemporary works. The Safdie brothers rented andrippedCriterion discs from Netflix growing up; Josh Safdie said that being acquired by Criterion felt like sneaking into a museum.[56]

OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 351 reviews, with an average score of 8.4/10; the site's "critics consensus" reads: "Uncut Gemsreaffirms the Safdies as masters of anxiety-inducing cinema—and proves Adam Sandler remains a formidable dramatic actor when given the right material."[63]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted averagescore of 93 out of 100 based on reviews by 56 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[64]Audiences polled byCinemaScoreduring the film's limited release gave it an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale. However, when CinemaScore re-polled audiences following the film's wide release, its score declined to "C+", and the film received an average score of 2 out of 5 stars onPostTrak.[57][60]
Sandler's performance received critical acclaim, with some commentators calling it the best of his career.[65][66][67][68]Todd McCarthyofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote that "Many will agree that this is Sandler's best performance, and the Safdies will finally move from the fringes of the commercial film scene to somewhere closer to the center."[69]Sandler was talked up as a possibleAcademy Award for Best Actornominee.[70]OnThe Howard Stern Show, he joked that if he did not win an Oscar, he would make the "worst movie ever ... so bad on purpose just to make you all pay."[71]After learning that he had not been nominated, he congratulatedKathy Bates—his former co-star inThe Waterboy(1998)—on herBest Supporting Actressnomination, and joked that he finally "can stop wearing suits."[70]
Eric Kohn ofIndieWiregave the film a grade of "A", calling it "a riveting high-wire act, pairing cosmic visuals with the gritty energy of a dark psychological thriller and sudden bursts of frantic comedy".[72]Jake Cole ofSlant Magazinegave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing: "As inGood Time,Uncut Gemsfinds the Safdies working in a genre rooted in the grimy, character-oriented crime films of the '70s."[73]Radheyan Simonpillai ofNowcommented that "there's so much propulsive, forward momentum even when the characters never get anywhere."[74]In her round-up of the2019 Toronto International Film Festival, Wendy Ide ofThe GuardianrankedUncut Gemsas one of the best films of the year, calling it "Audacious, thrilling and exhausting", describing Sandler's "remarkable performance" as one of the best performances of the year, and praising the cinematography.[75]
Justin Changof theLos Angeles Timessaid: "Directed with relentless tension and diamond-hard intelligence by Josh and Benny Safdie (who earlier this month won directing honors from theNew York Film Critics Circle),Uncut Gemsis a thriller and a character study, a tragedy and a blast."[68]Peter BradshawofThe Guardiancalled the film "a cinema of pure energy and grungy voltage, and the Safdies make it look very easy. This will be the year's most exciting film."[76]
The soundtrack and sound editing were acclaimed.Jon Caramanicaof theNew York Timeswrote that "there is no opportunity for sonic escape in 'Uncut Gems,' a film that often sounds like it is itself taking in three movies at once. The thrum of the thing is massive, varied and thick — the noise of the city, a paranoid score, and sometimes you even hear the dialogue."[77]
Kevin Garnett's performance was also praised,[78][79]with Brady Langmann ofEsquirecalling it the year's best breakout performance, and Alan Siegel writing onThe Ringerthat it was "one of the best acting performances by an athlete ever."[80][81]

Uncut Gemswas a large influence on developing the visual language and camera work in thePixarfilmInside Out 2, and many of its elements were used in the film. The film's main characters are personifications of the feelings of Riley, a teenage girl, andUncut Gemsinfluenced the framing of Anxiety's scenes, particularly when Anxiety takes charge of Riley's brain.[98][99]
The film received praise from Diamond District workers for its accurate portrayal of the industry and the high-stress setting, although various workers noted that certain aspects of Howard's character were exaggerated for dramatic effect, including his gambling addiction, his large debts, and his willingness to evade anti-smuggling laws.[100][101][102][103]Several real-life industry figures received cameos in the film.[104]
Uncut Gemswas the last feature film by the Safdie brothers before they dissolved their partnership in 2024,[105]although the brothers also collaborated with Sandler on the short filmGoldman v. Silverman(2020).[106]The brothers had previously been working on a follow-up film that also starred Sandler, but Benny dropped out. He emphasized that Josh would continue to work on the film and that he had not made significant contributions during pre-production.[107]Following the split, Josh turned his attention to a different project,Marty Supreme, starringTimothée Chalamet,[105]and shot a Netflix comedy special with Sandler.[106]

According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal.

After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner.

UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

Club, Linda Holmes ofNPR, and MaryAnn Sleasman ofTV Guideeach found Menzel's acting adequate but lacking the conviction and humor Midler brought to the role, resulting in a less compelling version of the same character.[136][139][141]
In 2019, she starred oppositeAdam Sandlerin the crime thrillerUncut Gems, playing his character's estranged and frustrated wife Dinah Ratner.[142]The role was considered a stark departure for Menzel, who longed to be involved in a project that differed from thefamily-friendlymaterial she had become synonymous with.[143]DirectorsJosh and Benny Safdiecast her based on her performance as a similar character inSkintight, and Menzel drew upon personal experience for the role, having grown up around confident women like Dinah in New York.[143]She described Dinah as "the voice for how the audience feels as they're going through this roller-coaster ride" and avoided devolving her into merely a stereotype.[144]The film and Menzel's performance drew critical acclaim.[145][144]Writing forThe Post and Courier, Jocelyn Noveck found Menzel "compelling in the rare role that doesn't make use of her famous singing voice",[146]while Johnny Oleksinski of theNew York Postcalled her "delightfully abrasive".[147]
In 2021, Menzel co-starred alongsideCamila Cabello,Billy Porter, andJames CordeninKay Cannon'sjukebox musicaladaptationof theCinderellafairy tale, playing Cinderella's (Cabello) unkind stepmother Vivian.[148]Despite admiring actresses who had played the villainous role prior, Menzel wanted to eschew "the archetypal kind of idea of the straight-ahead evil nemesis" in order to uncover the trauma behind the character's cruel nature.[149]In addition to performing several covers for the film,[150]Menzel wrote and recorded an original song for her character entitled "Dream Girl",[151]which was shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.[152]Cinderellareceived mixed reviews,[153]but Menzel's performance was praised:IndieWire's Kristen Lopez said she played the character "deliciously",[154]whileRichard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesdescribed Menzel as "her usual spectacular self" and "arguably the most nuanced and empathetic 'evil' stepmother in 'Cinderella' history".[155]Michael Calleri of theNiagara Gazettesaid Menzel delivers the film's best performance.[156]
In 2022, Menzel reprised her role as Nancy in theEnchantedsequelDisenchanted.[157]Now the Queen of Anadalasia as Edward's (James Marsden) wife,[158]Menzel's character sings for the first time,[159][160]in addition to serving as the film's "voice of reason".[161]A pop version of Menzel's song, "Love Power", was released as thesoundtrack's lead single in November 2022.Disenchantedreceived mixed reviews; most critics appreciated hearing Menzel sing,[161][162][163]while others found her role brief and her song unmemorable.[164][165]Marya E. Gates ofRogerEbert.comcalled Menzel's performance "one of the few that manages to transcend beyond the subpar trappings of" the film, lamenting that she is "relegated to only a handful of scenes".[166]She also starred in an episode of theHGTVshowCelebrity I.O.U.with theProperty BrothersDrewandJonathan Scott.[167]In this episode, she helped the brothers renovate a garage for her friend James.[168][169]

But whypigeonholesomeone so intriguingly offbeat?"[185]Eberson observed that she "interprets songs as much as an actress as a singer," believing, "therein lies her connection to the music and her fans."[185]Describing Menzel as a loud soprano similar to Broadway actressEthel Merman,Stephen HoldenofThe New York Timeswrote "The sound she creates when she belts ... is a primal cry embedded in her being that insists that we listen and pay attention."[185]Holden observed that her voice can alternate between "babyish and demanding, or it can sound grand and imperial" depending on the song choice.[186]According to Andrew Gans ofPlaybill, Menzel has "one of the most unique voices of her generation, a pliablealtothat can be sweet and girlish in its middle register and then easily soar to pop-influenced top notes way abovehigh C."[23]FrozensongwriterKristen Anderson-Lopezdescribed Menzel's voice as "a warm hug" with "this warmth and this vulnerability down low. And then, as you bring her higher and higher, she gets stronger and stronger, and more powerful. She just reaches into your soul when she's singing these big, giant songs."[105]
Menzel is known for her signature high belting style; theKennedy Centerwebsite cites Menzel as a prime example of a "Broadway Belter" who uses the technique to her advantage.[187]Theater criticCharles Isherwoodsaid the singer "has a voice that is very much her own," describing it as "totally distinctive" with "a great belt and a great range."[188]Describing Menzel's voice as "husky ... which sometimes veers toward shrieking until she effortlessly reins herself in or, amazingly, kicks it up another notch," Melissa Ruggieri ofThe Atlanta Journal-Constitutionbelieves she possesses "a superior instrument" both live and in-studio.[189]Explaining her own technique, Menzel said she avoids moving her shoulders while singing and prefers "to take a smaller breath for a bigger, longer note because there's less air that will come pummeling out."[190]She also maintains her voice by constantly steaming and practicingvocal warm ups,[188]describing her routine as "very ritualistic" and "disciplined".[191]Despite her live vocals earning consistent acclaim,[180][192]some critics have criticized Menzel's belting for sounding "screechy".[193]Schuyler Velasco ofThe Christian Science Monitorobserved that the singer "made a career out of belting notes that would fry the vocal chords of mere mortals", but felt the emotion of her performances sometimes suffers at the hands of her vocal proficiency.[65]Velasco cited her rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" atSuper Bowl XLIXas an example of Menzel sacrificing excitement and inspiration for technique, yet delivering an adequate performance nonetheless.[65]Menzel addressed such criticisms during a 2014 concert, explaining that she wishes to sing loud, proud and "from the heart" like her idols Merman and Aretha Franklin.[193]Tim Smith ofThe Baltimore Sunwrote that Menzel's "high-wattage vocal cords and intense phrasing ... [make] a mark whenever she sings."[188]Menzel admits that she finds some of her most famous songs challenging, namely songs from theFrozenfilms, which "push her to vocal extremes" and require constant warming up and sometimes lowering the key for live performances.[105]The term "powerhouse" has often been used in the media to describe Menzel's vocal ability.[194][195][196][197][198]
Menzel's vocal style has drawn comparisons to singerBarbra Streisand, whose song "Don't Rain on My Parade" she often covers, including in tribute to her at the 2008 Kennedy Center Honors.[180][199]Menzel said she had long aspired to have a career as successful as Streisand to whose Jewish upbringing Menzel has also been compared, with fans deeming her "the next big Jewish icon in music".[180]Menzel was particularly inspired by Streisand's performance in the filmA Star is Born(1976),[200]and cites singers Franklin,Billie Holiday,Etta James,Chaka KhanandSarah Vaughanamong her vocal idols.[20][201][202]Despite emulating her inspirations, Menzel claims she maintains the importance of "finding [her] own voice."[20]Some critics have dubbed Menzel "the Streisand of her generation".[181][182][203]Similar comparisons have been drawn between Menzel and singerBette Midler.[180]
Professionally trained as a classical singer from age eight, Menzel decided to pursue different genres such asR&Bandjazzonce she began high school.[204]Upon becoming a wedding singer, Menzel was eventually exposed to a wide variety of musical genres, ranging from jazz to rock andMotown,[204]and would often experiment with new arrangements of traditional songs.[191]She credits her wedding singer background with training her to improvise new vocal arrangements, which in turn helps herad-libalternative versions of songs when she is feeling unwell or her voice is tired.[191]Her set lists tend to incorporate an eclectic combination of original material and covers of popular pop, rock, musical theatre and film songs,[205]selecting an assortment of songs she expects fans want to hear and feels inspired to attempt new interpretations of.[206]Jay Handelman of theSarasota Herald-Tribuneopined that Menzel's song choices "reinforce her own offbeat personality."[205]According to Menzel, her song selections usually indicate a milestone, choosing to convey a stories and memories about her life using music.[195]Menzel often opts to perform barefoot in concert, which has become a trademark of her live performances.[193]She also enjoys conversing with audience members in-between musical performances.[182]In addition to her vocal prowess, Menzel has been noted for her charming and witty banter;[182][127]Smith described her as "a pro at delivering stage banter and as quick on the draw with one-liners as seasoned stand-up comedians."[188]On her stage presence,The Denver Postcritic Ray Mark Rinaldi wrote that Menzel delivers "the kind of self-assurance that can only come from beating out Kristin Chenoweth for a Tony. She comes out on stage, dressed like she doesn't care, acting a little dizzy, but knowing all along she's gonna hit the right notes."[207]
Menzel has become closely associated with songs about self-empowerment,[206][208]specifically herSignature Songs"Defying Gravity" and "Let it Go".[209]Discussing Disneyauthor Amy M. Davis believes Menzel's voice "has become associated with rebellion for Broadway fans."[209]However, the artist claims such themes have made her feel fraudulent at times because she herself does not always feel empowered.[20]Subsequently, she began incorporating more emotional material into her sets, such asRadiohead's "Creep".[20][206]Although Menzel co-writes most of her own material as a singer-songwriter,[151][210][211][212]she considers herself a collaborator rather than a songwriter, explaining that she prefers working with professional songwriters or producers: "They start playing some music, and I like to sing… I can sing melodies, I come up with titles and lyrical ideas, but I'm really not good at making decisions."[191]She has frequently collaborated with songwriter and producerGlen Ballard, and tends to draw upon lyrics from her personal diary and melodies from a tape recorder.[201]Menzel claims she has never completed writing a song entirely on her own, finding the process to be too stressful: "I never had a good song that I wrote, so to ... act like I'm this great songwriter, I would be just a fraud. But, I'm good at bringing myself to it—being a good collaborator in the room."[191]She citesJoni MitchellandAnnie Lennoxamong her musical influences, describing them as "singer-songwriters who had these amazing voices but also were incredible storytellers and lyricists", while expressing admiration for musiciansBono,StingandSeal.[201]The Ithacan's Preston Arment observed that "what Menzel may lack in songwriting ability, she makes up for with stunning vocals that remind us why listeners will never stop loving her."[213]AllMusicbiographer Marcy Donelson described Menzel's studio albums as a combination ofAdult Alternative,vocal, andcontemporary popmusic.[214]Menzel's fifth studio album, which she considers to be her most personal to-date, contains a combination of ballads and upbeat tracks that explore themes about home, personal loss, empowerment,[213]relationships and starting over, much of which was inspired by her divorce from Taye Diggs.[211][197]Bailey Flynn ofThe Heightsbelieves the album demonstrates several trademarks for which Menzel has become known: "power balladsthat give her huge vocal range and mind-blowing control all the chance they need to show off."[197]
Menzel described performing her own songs live as "scarier" than singing covers or songs from established shows because "You're a little bit more transparent. There's no costume or character I'm hiding behind ... yet sometimes it's more rewarding because of that", describing the feeling of hearing fans sing songs she has written herself as "incredible".[201]
Menzel has been called one of Broadway's greatest performers.[20][215][216][217][218][219]Tim Beedle ofDC.comdeclared her "arguably the most widely recognized Broadway star in the country".[220]Several media publications havenicknamedher the "Queen of Broadway" due to her success and impact on the genre.[221][222][223][224][225][226][227][228]Often described as one of the defining singing voices of her generation,[229][230]Apple Musicreferred to her as "one of the 21st century's premier vocalists".[231]Jenny Singer ofGlamourdeclared Menzel one of history's greatest musical theatre vocalists,[232]while Valerie Complex ofDeadline Hollywoodcalled her an influential performer who has "left an indelible mark on the industry".[233]TheToronto Sun's Jim Slotek dubbed her "this generation's Broadway icon".[234]In a 2020retrospective,Cleveland.com's Troy L. Smith named Menzel the best vocalist of 2013, claiming the success of that year's "Let it Go" only cemented her legacy as "one of Broadway's greatest stars of all time".[215]The previous year,BroadwayWorldrecognized Menzel as one of the decade's 10 most influential Broadway stars.[235]Time Outranked Menzel the 19th greatest female Broadway actress of all time, observing that she established a "stratospheric reputation" largely based on the popularity of only two roles:RentandWicked.[236]Vulture's Jackson McHenry attributed the popularity and endurance of "Defying Gravity" to Menzel, believing few singers can service the song as successfully as she has.[237]In 2018,NPRnamed "Let it Go" one of the 200 greatest female-performed songs of the 21st century, at number 182.[238]
Menzel's successfulcrossoverfrom stage actor to television, film, and music star have been discussed at length,[128]withRedbookdubbing her "One of [Broadway's] biggest crossover success stories".[239]Menzel's biography onStarzdescribed her as the kind of stage-to-screen star Broadway seldom produces anymore.[184]Marty Hughley ofThe Oregonianshared a similar sentiment, writing in 2012 that although Broadway does not guarantee global superstardom as often as it used to, Menzel is "a notable exception to the rule of Broadway’s declining clout".[240]Original Broadway cast recordings ofRentandIf/Then, both albums prominently featuring Menzel as a soloist, debuted within the top-20 of theBillboard 200.[110]In a 2014 article,Billboardtheorized that Menzel's crossover success "bodes well for Broadway's would-be stars", believing "Let it Go" "kicked open the door for future composers of stage and screen".[241]When Menzel returned to Broadway in 2014 shortly after the success ofFrozen, Suzy Evans ofBillboardobserved that audience reception was more akin to that of a "rock star" than a musical theatre performer.[242]Menzel's fanbase has nicknamed themselves "Fanzels".[242]In addition to her perceived authenticity, Isherwood attributes the artist's large following to the successes ofRentandWicked: "two era-defying, hugely successful Broadway musicals".[188]Toronto Startheatre criticRichard Ouzouniancredits the same two shows with solidifying her reputation as one of the industry's "most dynamic musical theatre stars".[243]She has been described as "Broadway royalty", due to a combination of her successful stage career and playing royalty in several Disney projects.[244][245]
According to Akiva Gottlieb of theLos Angeles Times, Menzel's public persona is largely defined by her performances inFrozenandWicked, and recording Christmas albums.[143]As an actress, Menzel has earned a reputation for playing misunderstood characters both on stage and in film,[151]admitting she gravitates towards complex roles.[149][246]She cited power and vulnerability as common traits among characters she has played.[247]According to theIrish Independent, Menzel has become "a go-to actress for producers looking for a feisty female lead",[248]whileThe Globe and Mail's Courtney Shea said she "forged her career playing strong and sensational females".[247]Menzel believes Broadway has always offered compelling roles for women of all ages, whereas she considers Hollywood to be more susceptible toageismandsexism.[248]Menzel is revered as arole modelfor young women, particularly due to her role as Elsa which has contributed her a large following among predominantly femaleFrozenfans.[249]Although she takes her responsibility as a role model seriously,[249]she has stated that she does not always feel like a role model in her personal life and feels uncomfortable bearing the responsibility at times.[248][250]Menzel has a prominent gay following,[251][252]dating back to the 1990s when she starred inRent.[228][253]Rentwas also one of the first Broadway shows to show a lesbian relationship.[227]The performer attributes this to playing several repressed characters who are "hiding something within them that they’re afraid to let people see, and then finally they embrace it".[253]Michael Heaton, a critic forThe Plain Dealer, noted that some parents have expressed concerns about the "blue humor" Menzel uses in her typical concerts in an attempt to appeal to both her adult gay and young fans.[252]
Diana Bunici ofEvoke.iedubbed Menzel "the voice of the new generation".[194]In 2014, Menzel was awarded "Breakthrough Artist" byBillboard.[202]In 2019, Menzel and actressKristen Bell, who plays her sister inFrozen, received neighboring stars—Menzel's was the 2682nd and Bell's was the 2681st—on theHollywood Walk of Fame.[254][255]Menzel was inducted into the live theatre category.[256]Menzel is also among the wealthiest Broadway performers, due in part to her television, film and music careers.[257]In 2022, Menzel was announced as a recipient of aDisney Legends Awardfor her outstanding contributions tothe Walt Disney Company,[258]with herD23entry reading "Whether on stage or screen, Idina Menzel’s unequivocal signature talents have shone through countless projects across her almost 30-year career".[259]In October 2024, PresidentJoe Bidenawarded Menzel with theNational Medal of Arts.[260]
