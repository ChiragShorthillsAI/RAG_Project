Noelleis a 2019 AmericanChristmasfantasy comedyfilm written and directed byMarc Lawrence, produced byWalt Disney Picturesand distributed byWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The film starsAnna Kendrick,Bill Hader,Kingsley Ben-Adir,Billy Eichner,Julie Hagerty, andShirley MacLainewith supporting roles done byDiana Maria Riva, Maceo Smedley,Jason Antoon,Michael Gross, and Billy Griffith. The film tells the story of the daughter of Santa Claus who goes to look for her brother who is next in line to become the new Santa Claus when he doesn't return from a week off and enlists a private investigator to help find him. She must find her brother and bring him back in time for Christmas. It was filmed from October 2017 to January 2018 inBritish ColumbiaandWoodstock, Georgia.
Noellewas released on November 12, 2019 onDisney+. It received generally mixed reviews from critics.
At the North Pole, preparations for the upcoming Christmas are quickly taking place. After the currentSanta Claus's death five months prior, his son Nick Kringle is having difficulties trying to complete his training to become the next Santa. His younger sister Noelle who has been placed in charge of distributing and maintaining Christmas spirit, continues to support him, and even suggests taking the weekend off to avoid the stress and relax before the big day. Complying, Nick takes off overnight with the reindeer.
When the reindeer return the following weekend without Nick and Noelle admits to giving him controversial advice, theChristmas elvesget disappointed in her and Nick'spuffinfriends get angry at her. The elf elders forcibly appoint her cousin Gabriel who works as the Kringles' tech support to become the new Santa. Guilt-stricken and forlorn, Noelle deduces that Nick fled toPhoenix, Arizona, and takes off with the sleigh and reindeer with her childhood nanny Polly.
They set down in theDesert Ridge Marketplace. With the permission of manager Helen Rojas and the customers' support and belief that it was a Christmas exhibit, Noelle sets out into the city to find Nick, leaving Polly to tend to the sleigh and reindeer. She meets and hires Jake Hapman, a private investigator as well as a recently divorced dad, to track down Nick. Noelle also interacts with Jake's enthusiastic son Alex and several other people, discovering that she can understand and communicate in other languages (includingAmerican Sign Language) as well as tell the naughty from the nice.
Jake tracks Nick down to a yoga studio where Nick is enthusiastic to see Noelle yet refuses to return north and become Santa. After a heated argument, Noelle leaves the building. She returns to the mall where her reindeer friend Snowcone arrives with a letter from Mrs. Claus informing her about the situation back home and ordering her to find and bring Nick back home. During Noelle's time away, Gabriel uses an algorithm to determine that there are only 2,837 "nice" children in the world, much to the horror of the elves and Mrs. Claus.
With help from Snowcone, Noelle tracks down Nick to a yoga retreat at theDesert Botanical Garden, and convinces him to return. Meeting up with her and Polly at the mall the next day, Noelle has him continue to train by being a mall Santa. While Nick sees the text message being sent to children from Gabriel, Jake discovers that Noelle told Alex about his Christmas wish, something that he finds awkward as his ex-wife remarried. Noelle reveals that she is Santa's daughter, causing him to leave. When Nick is accosted by the actual mall Santa, Noelle intervenes and accidentally hurts a police officer, resulting in her arrest and later hospitalization for psychological evaluation. Everyone present gets a heads up text from Gabriel about how they behaved this year.
After a visit from Polly, who reveals her identity as an elf, Jake removes Noelle from the hospital and she makes her way back to the North Pole with Nick, Polly, and the reindeer before Christmas Eve.
Back home after a meeting with the elders, Nick nominates Noelle as the next Santa. This stirs up controversy throughout the town, but unanimously gains agreement from the elders when they determine that there is no rule against a female Santa and they are convinced she naturally has the skills. After a few mishaps including a visit to a Jewish family, Noelle successfully delivers the presents across the world and drops Jake off at his ex-wife's house to spend time with Alex.
Noelle is celebrated at the North Pole as Gabriel happily returns to tech support, Nick opens up a yoga studio, and Polly becomes an elf elder. Noelle admits that she is proud to continue her father's legacy for being the 24th-generation Santa and that Christmas will go on.
On January 11, 2017, it was announced thatAnna Kendrickwould play the titular role of Santa Claus's daughter in the film, then titledNicole, which would be written and directed byMarc Lawrenceand produced bySuzanne ToddforWalt Disney Pictures.[1]In July 2017,Bill Haderjoined the cast.[2]In September 2017,Billy EichnerandShirley MacLainejoined the cast.[3][4]In October 2017,Julie Hagertyand Maceo Smedley joined the cast.[5]In November 2017,Michael Grossjoined the cast.[6]
Principal photographybegan in late-October 2017 inVancouver,British Columbia, and later moved toWhistler Olympic Parkin early-January 2018, where filming continued until January 19, 2018. The exterior for the shelter in Phoenix wasSt. James Anglican Church—the church's name can be seen in the Christmas Eve shot. Additional photography also took place inWoodstock, Georgia.[7][8][9]Cody Fitzgerald andClyde Lawrencecomposed the film's score.[10]
The film was originally scheduled to be theatrically released on November 8, 2019, byWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.[11][12]On February 8, 2018, it was revealed that the film, which had been retitled fromNicoletoNoelle, would be released onDisney+instead.[13]It was released on November 12, 2019, four days after its original theatrical release date.[14]It was released in the United Kingdom and Latin America on November 27, 2020.[15]
TheReview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoesreports an approval rating of 55% based on 42 reviews with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "The always charming Anna Kendrick does her best, butNoelle's progressive take on a timeless tale is unfortunately subdued."[16]Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[17]
Nick Allen ofRoger Ebert.comgave the film a grade of three out of four stars, writing, "Noellehas more going for it than just being one of the easiest ways for Disney+ to make a good first impression. [...]Noellehas plenty of charm—the kind that makes a Christmas story not just simply amiable, but worth a look."[18]Jennifer Green ofCommon Sense Mediarated the movie a three out of five stars and wrote, "Noelleis appropriate for the whole family but will likely appeal most to grade-schoolers, who are likely to feel the most connection with its holiday-spirit messages, storylines, and humor, as well as with star Anna Kendrick. [...] The subplots of kids being deemed naughty or nice and families seeking togetherness and well-being over material possessions offer positive messages for all ages."[19]Tim Robey ofThe Telegraphgave the film three out of five stars and stated, "It isn't exactly cinema's salvation, with a story that's a near-shameless retread of Jon Favreau's Elf, this time sticking Anna Kendrick in Will Ferrell's pointy shoes. But it's likeable stay-at-home fluff – the kind of thing you could stick on as mood music while you get the decorations out."[20]
Matt Fowler ofIGNrated the film 6.7 out of 10, indicating, "Noelleis a bouncy-yet-benign Christmas caper that, despite fun performances, falls short of instant greatness."[21]Gwen Ihnat ofThe A.V Clubrated the movie C+ and said: "Noellehas a few of those peppermint hot chocolate moments, but thanks to its bizarre warm-weather detour and wasting of a stellar cast, it just barely makes the nice list."[22]
Emily St. James ofVoxgraded the movie 2.5 out of 5, stating, "Noellefrequently feels like it's running in place, frantically throwing shiny objects in your face in the hope you don't lose interest. But for fans of movie depictions of Christmas, there are worse options. The production design and costumes are sprightly and colorful, and Lawrence is terrific at keeping the story moving, even when it doesn't seem like it has any reason to keep going."[23]Kate Erbland ofIndieWiregave the film a C− rating and claimed, "Kendrick is delightful, but this Christmas comedy is a cheap holiday tchotchke with no staying power."[24]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle. Its first film appearance was with the release ofStrange World.[60]The logo received widespread praise from critics and audiences and won Gold in the "Theatrical | Film: Design" medium at the 2023Clio Entertainment Awardsin November 2023. The standard version of the logo premiered theatrically withThe Beach Boys.[61]

Hader grew up with writer Duffy Boudreau, with whom he later collaborated. He says he "had a hard time focusing in class" and "was always joking around". Feeling he did not fit in, Hader filled his time watching movies and reading. He appreciatedMonty Python,British comedy, and the films ofWoody AllenandMel Brooks, much of which his father showed him.[11]He made short films with friends and starred in a school production ofThe Glass Menagerie.[12]He was unable to gain admission to top film schools because of his "abysmal" grades, so he enrolled atThe Art Institute of Phoenix,[13]and laterScottsdale Community College.[11]Hader's first job was as a Christmas tree salesman.

Hader's aspirations of becoming a filmmaker eventually led him to drop out of college and move to Los Angeles in 1999.[7][11]His parents supported his decision, and let him use the money they had saved for his education for his living expenses.[12]He found work as a production assistant (PA) while scouring the back pages ofThe Hollywood Reporter,[18]and hoped to become anassistant director.[18]He spent much of his life as a young man "lonely and underemployed" and large amounts of his time watching movies.[18]He regularly worked 18-hour days as a PA, leaving little time to pursue his creative ambitions.[12]He was a PA on the documentaryEmpire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy(2004) and the feature filmsJames Dean(2001),Spider-Man(2002) andCollateral Damage(2002).[7][19]He was also a post-production assistant on theVH1reality showThe Surreal Life(2003–2006).[20]He was briefly a PA and stage manager onPlayboy TV's sexual fantasy showNight Calls,[21][22][23]but soon quit as he feared it would disappoint his parents.[15]He eventually quit being a PA altogether after a bad experience while shootingThe Scorpion King(2002).[18]
Hader subsequently got a job as a night-time assistant editor at the post-production facility Triage Entertainment.[12][18]He invested money in his own short film, but was too embarrassed to release it. Shortly thereafter, he and his then-longtime girlfriend broke up.[24]Desperate for a change, he began attending comedy classes with friends atimprovisational comedyenterprisethe Second Cityin March 2003.[13]He quickly realized that comedy was the creative outlet he had been looking for,[12]and soon he, his new comedy compatriot Matt Offerman, and their two friends and fellow humor enthusiasts Eric Filipkowski and Mel Cowan formed a sketch comedy group,[25]which they called Animals from the Future, and performed frequently for small audiences at backyard shows in Van Nuys.[18]Matt's brother, actorNick Offerman, told his wife,Megan Mullally, about them.[26][27]After attending one of their backyard shows, Mullally told Hader she wanted to discuss him withLorne MichaelsofSaturday Night Live(SNL).

Named after child actressShirley Temple, who was six years old at the time, Shirley MacLean Beaty was born on April 24, 1934, inRichmond, Virginia. Her father, Ira Owens Beaty,[3]was a professor of psychology, public school administrator, and a real estate agent. Her Canadian mother, Kathlyn Corinne (née MacLean), was a drama teacher fromWolfville, Nova Scotia. MacLaine's younger brother is the actor, writer, and directorWarren Beatty, who changed the spelling of his surname for his career.[4]Both were raised by their parents asBaptists.[5]Her mother's brother-in-law wasA. A. MacLeod, aCommunistmember of theOntarioprovincial legislature in the 1940s.[6][7]
While MacLaine was still a child, Ira Beaty moved the family from Richmond toNorfolk, and then toArlington, then toWaverly, and then back to Arlington, where he worked at Thomas Jefferson Junior High School in Arlington, in 1945. MacLaine played baseball on a boys team, holding the record for most home runs, which earned her the nickname "Powerhouse". During the 1950s, the family resided in theDominion Hillssection of Arlington.[8]
As a toddler, she had weak ankles and fell over with the slightest misstep, so her mother decided to enroll her in ballet class at the Washington School of Ballet at the age of three.[9]This was the beginning of her interest in performing. Strongly motivated by ballet, she never missed a class. In classical romantic pieces such asRomeo and JulietandThe Sleeping Beauty, she always played the boys' roles because she was the tallest in the groups of girls. MacLaine eventually was cast in a substantial female role as the fairy godmother inCinderellaand while warming up backstage, broke her ankle. She tightened the ribbons on her toe shoes and completed the entire performance before calling for an ambulance.

MacLaine, however, did receive positive notices from critics.Vincent Canbywrote in hisThe New York Timesreview that the film "exhibits no sense of humor and no appreciation for the ridiculous ... the screenplay [is] often dreadful ... the only appealing performance is Miss MacLaine's, and she's too good to be true.A Change of Seasonsdoes prove one thing, though. A farce about characters who've been freed of their conventional obligations quickly becomes aimless."[29]
