The company was originally established byWalt Disneyin 1953 asBuena Vista Film Distribution Company Inc.(later renamedBuena Vista Distribution Inc.andBuena Vista Pictures Distribution Inc.). It took on its current name in late 2007.[7][8]
Before in 1953, Disney's productions were previously distributed by:
A dispute withRKO Picturesin 1953 over the distribution ofThe Living Desert, Disney's first full-length film in theTrue-Life Adventuresseries,[9]led Walt and his older brotherRoy O. Disneyto form its wholly owned subsidiary, the Buena Vista Film Distribution Company, Inc. (BVDC), to handle North American distribution of their own products.[7]RKO refused to distribute the film.[9]The name "Buena Vista" came from the eponymous street in Burbank, California, where theWalt Disney Studioswas located (and remains to this day). Buena Vista's first release was theAcademy Award-winning live-action featureThe Living Deserton November 10, 1953, along withToot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, Buena Vista's first animated release.[10]Notable subsequent releases included the Austrian filmVictoria in Dover, the JapaneseDaieifilmPrincess Yang Kwei Fei(Most Noble Lady), released in US theaters in September 1956,[11][12][13]The Missouri Travelerin March 1958,[10]andThe Big Fishermanin July 1959 (the first third-party production financed by Disney).[10]
By July 5, 1957,RKO Japan, Ltd.was sold to Disney Productions and British Commonwealth Film Corporation. In allocating the foreign film licenses to the company, Disney would use 5 and Commonwealth 8.[14]
In April 1960, the company dropped "Film" from its name.[8]In 1961, Disney incorporated Buena Vista International (BVI),[15]distributing its first PG-rated film,Take Down, in January 1979.[10]The low-budget movie was not produced by the Disney studios and was acquired from an independent studio, makingThe Black Holethe first PG-rated Disney film.[16]In late July 1990, Buena Vista changed its name to Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc. (BVPD).[8]
In the 1980s, Disney purchased a controlling stake in one ofPacific Theatres' chains[17]leading to Disney's Buena Vista Theaters and Pacific to renovate theEl Capitan Theatreand theCrestby 1989.[18]The Crest was finished first while El Capitan opened with the premiere ofThe Rocketeerfilm on June 19, 1991.[19]
In 1992, Buena Vista made production loans totaling $5.6 million toCinergi Picturesfor its filmMedicine Manand its 1994 filmsRenaissance ManandColor of Nightand were distributing Cinergi's films. The corporation purchased a 12.8% share in Cinergi with its initial public offering in 1994.[20]Soon, BVPD signed a 25 picture distribution deal with Cinergi.[21][22]
Gaumontand Disney formed Gaumont Buena Vista International, a joint venture in French distribution, in 1993.[23]In August 1996, Disney andTokuma ShotenPublishing agreed that Disney would distributeStudio Ghiblianimated films and provide 10% of the production cost of the studio's current in-production film,Spirited Away.[24][25][26]Disney would go on to produce the English dubs and distribute 15 of Ghibli's films, through theWalt Disney Pictures,Buena Vista Home Video,MiramaxandTouchstone Picturesbanners.[27]
In September 1996, following Disney's acquisition ofCapital Cities/ABC, Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc. was merged[8]into ABC, Inc.,[28]the parent company of that group.
For the November 1995 premiere ofToy Story, Disney rented theHollywood Masonic Temple—adjacent to the El Capitan Theatre—forTotally Toy Story, a multimediafunhouseand a promotional event for the movie.[29]On July 17, 1998, Buena Vista Pictures Distribution purchased theHollywood Masonic Templebuilding to continue using it as a promotional venue.[30]
By 1997, BVPD's share in Cinergi dropped to 5%. After nine films were delivered under the agreement, Cinergi sold on November 22, 1997 all of its 12-film library with the exception ofDie Hard with a Vengeanceto Disney, plus $20 million in exchange for Disney's Cinergi share holdings, production advances of $35.4 million and other loans.[22]In 2002, Disney signed a four animated film deal withVanguard Animation;[31]however,only one filmwas released under that negotiation.[32]
In 2004, BVI and Gaumont dissolved their French distribution joint venture, Gaumont Buena Vista International.[23]Buena Vista International agreed to a distribution deal with MegaStar Joint Venture Company Limited in April 2006 for the Vietnam market.[33]
On April 25, 2007, Disney discontinued the usage of theBuena Vistabrand in its distribution branding.[7]
In early 2009, Disney entered a distribution agreement with a reorganizedDreamWorks; the deal called for an estimated 30 films over a five-year period from DreamWorks and they would be released through the Touchstone banner.[34]In 2011,GKIDSacquired the North American theatrical distribution rights of the Ghibli films, withWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainmentretaining the home video rights until July 2017 whenShout! Factorytook over the home video rights. However, Disney only handles home video distribution of the company's films in Japan and formerly Taiwan and China.[35][36]
Disney's distribution deal with DreamWorks expired in August 2016, after the two studios decided to not renew their agreement on December 16, 2015, withUniversal Picturesreplacing Disney as DreamWorks' distributor.[37][38]By the end of the deal, Disney had distributed 14 of DreamWorks's original 30-picture agreement; thirteen through Touchstone and one throughWalt Disney Pictures.[39][40]Disney took complete ownership rights of those 14 DreamWorks films fromAmblin Partnersin exchange for loans made to that company.[41]The Light Between Oceans, the final film in that distribution deal, was also the last film released under Touchstone.
On December 14, 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced plans topurchase 21st Century Fox, which included20th Century FoxandFox Searchlight Pictures. On March 20, 2019, the acquisition of 21st Century Fox was completed.[42]Following the reorganization and renaming of the acquired film units, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures began distributing20th Century Studiosfilms in the United States, while Searchlight continued to operate their autonomous distribution unit.[43][6]
In late 2020 and early 2021, Disney reorganized the studio, placing it under theDisney Media and Entertainment Distributionunit which also oversees distribution toDisney+.[44]Under this structure, the Theatrical Distribution unit oversaw the domestic and international films produced by all the studios within the Walt Disney Studios umbrella.[45]In February 2023, returning CEO Bob Iger reversed this decision and reorganized the studio again, returning it as a division under the purview ofThe Walt Disney Studios.
Walt Disney Studios has produced or distributed 36 films that have received nominations for theAcademy Award for Best Picture: fifteen from its formerMiramaxdivision,[46]six from bothTouchstone PicturesandSearchlight Pictures,[a]four fromWalt Disney Pictures, three from20th Century Studios,[b]two fromHollywood Pictures, and one fromMarvel Studios.[46][48][49][50]Of those nominated films, five films—Miramax'sThe English Patient,Shakespeare in Love,Chicago,No Country for Old Men, and Searchlight'sNomadland—have won Best Picture.[46][51][52]

In 1992, Disney opted to end their joint venture with Warner Bros. to start autonomously distributing their films in these aforementioned overseas markets beginning withAladdin, inspiring Warner Bros. to establish theFamily Entertainmentlabel to self-distribute family-friendly films under the Warner umbrella at the same period.
