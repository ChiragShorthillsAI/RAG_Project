Replicasis a 2018 Americanscience fictionthriller filmdirected byJeffrey Nachmanoff, and written by Chad St. John, from a story by Stephen Hamel. The film tells the story of aneuroscientistwho violates the law andbioethicsto bring his family members back to life after they die in a car accident. It starsKeanu Reeves,Alice EveandThomas Middleditch.
It was shown at theNight Visions International Film FestivalatFinlandin November 2018, and was theatrically released in theUnited Stateson January 11, 2019, byEntertainment Studios Motion Pictures. The film received negative reviews from critics, who criticized the writing,plot holes, CGI and acting; it also became abox-office bomb.
William Foster and Ed Whittle are biomedical research scientists working for Bionyne Corporation inPuerto Rico, attempting to transfer the mind of a dead soldier into anandroidwith superhuman strength, codenamed Subject 345. Foster specializes in synthetic biology and mapping of the mind's neural pathways, while Whittle's specialty is reproductivehuman cloning. Foster successfully captures the soldier's neural map and transfers it into the android's synthetic brain, but the experiment fails when the soldier recoils in horror at the android body and destroys it, killing himself again. Foster's boss Jones warns him that if he cannot get Subject 345 to work, the company's shareholders will shut the project down.
Foster takes his wife Mona and three children Sophie, Matt, and Zoe, on a boating trip, but on the way all except Foster are killed in a car crash. Determined to resurrect his family, he coaxes Ed to bring him the Bionyne equipment necessary to extract his family's neural maps and to clone replacement bodies for them. He successfully extracts their neural maps and tells Whittle to dispose of the bodies, but the first major obstacle to his plan presents itself: only three cloning pods are available, forcing him to choose one to sacrifice. He chooses Zoe, the youngest, and erases her memory from the neural maps of the other three. Whittle starts the seventeen-day cycle required to create mature replacement clones for Foster's family, and tells him he has only that long to solve the problem of integrating the neural maps into the cloned bodies, or else they will start to deteriorate by aging at an abnormally fast rate. Integrating the mind into a biological clone was phase two of the research project, to be solved after android transfer. Foster is forced to keep this secret, since he and Whittle have stolen millions of dollars of Bionyne equipment and are breakingbioethics. He spends the seventeen days removing evidence of Zoe's existence from his home, and creating cover stories of illness to explain his family's absence from work, school, and social media contact.
When Foster notices his wife's central nervous system reacting to his touch, he realizes that Subject 345 failed because the mind expects connection to a biological body with heartbeat and respiration, rather than a synthetic one. He knows now that transfer into the clones will not be a problem, and the failure of android transfer can be solved by programming a simulated mind-body interface to make the android body appear biological. He successfully transfers the minds of his loved ones into the cloned bodies, then goes back to work creating a synthetic mind-body interface. When the next dead body he receives has suffered too much brain damage to be viable, Foster resorts to recording his own mind for the android transfer. Meanwhile, Sophie has a nightmare of her mother's death, and Mona catches Foster erasing her memory of the event. He confesses that they died in a car crash and that he resurrected them. The family soon discovers evidence of Zoe's existence that he missed, and he admits that he couldn't save Zoe and erased their memories of her.
Jones confronts Foster and reveals that he is aware of what Foster and Whittle have done. He tells him the research is not actually intended for medical purposes, but is being financed by theU.S. governmentto provide a military weapon, and that Foster's family are loose ends to be eliminated. Foster destroys the mind-body interface, incapacitates Jones, and flees, attempting to escape by boat. Jones' henchmen capture Foster's family. He pursues them to Bionyne, where it is clear that Whittle has sold them out. Jones kills Whittle and forces Foster to finish Subject 345. Foster uploads his own mind into Subject 345, who kills the henchmen and mortally wounds Jones. The two Fosters make a deal with Jones: he can live in a cloned body and become rich by working with Foster-345, selling clone transfers to wealthy people looking for a second life. Meanwhile, Foster is able to retire in peace with his family, including the newly cloned Zoe.

Allen Media Group, alternately known by its former name ofEntertainment Studios, Inc.is an American media and entertainment company based inLos Angeles. Owned and founded in 1993 by businessmanByron Allen, the company was initially involved in the production and distribution of first-run television series forU.S.television syndication. Under theEntertainment Studios Networksdivision, it also operates a group ofdigital cableandsatellitechannels, which broadcast a mix of original programs and the company's syndicated content.
In the late 2010s, the company made several major expansions to its operations, including entering thefilm distributionmarket; acquiringThe Weather ChannelfromNBCUniversalandBain Capital; partnering withSinclair Broadcast Groupto operate theregional sports networkchainBally SportsviaDiamond Sports Group; and its acquisition of television stations from another minority-owned media group,Bayou City Broadcasting.
With television experience as being a former co-host of theNBCseriesReal Peoplefrom 1979 until 1984,stand-up comedianByron Allen launched his own weekly syndicatedlate-night talk show,The Byron Allen Show, in 1989. It was produced by his BYCA Productions andAllbritton Communications, and distributed by Genesis Entertainment.[5]
By 1991, Allen had created BYCA Television Distribution to take over distribution of his talk show as well as syndicate other programs.[6]By early 1993, Allen's talk show, which became a weeknightstripthe previous fall,[7]had been cancelled, and BYCA Television Distribution had been embroiled in a lawsuit filed by former employees who claimed they hadn't been paid by Allen.[8]Amidst the legal and financial issues, creditors forced BYCA intoChapter 7 bankruptcy.[9]The same year, Allen foundedCF Entertainment.[10][11]Following a similar business model to BYCA, Allen was able to succeed where he had failed before by focusing on producing low-cost, syndicated non-fiction programming, including interview series andcourt shows(largely scripted from actual testimony). Allen served as host for some of these programs.[12]In December 2003, CF became Entertainment Studios.[11]Entertainment Studiosgreen-litits first film and stage projects in December 2011, when it acquired the rights to develop abiographical filmandtheatrical playon the life ofSammy Davis Jr.from his daughter,Tracey Davis.[13]
The company ventured into scripted programming in 2012, with the third-quarter launch of the sitcomsMr. Box OfficeandThe First Family.[14]Both were set for 104 episodes[14]over two years under a model of accelerated production similar toDebmar-Mercury's10-90 Model.[15]The two half-hour shows were picked up as a two-hour weekend primetimeprogramming blockwith two episodes of each show back to back byTribune,WeigelandCBS Television Stationgroups.[14]
The company launched its eighth cable channel and first ad-supported service, Justice Central.TV, on December 10, 2012.[16]
In 2015, the company separately suedAT&T,Comcast, andCharter Communicationsfor racial discrimination in being biased against minority-run entertainment companies in not carrying its cable channels. AT&T settled in December with the addition of 7 of Entertainment Studios' channels added to AT&T'sDirecTVlineup. Entertainment Studios added similar suits against Charter and the FCC.[17]The Comcast case, though initially dismissed at the district court, was allowed to go forward by the Ninth Circuit; Comcast was able to successfully petition theSupreme Courtto hear its case inComcast v. National Association of African-American-Owned Mediain November 2019.
In October 2015, Entertainment Studios acquiredFreestyle Releasingfor an undisclosed amount "said to be sealed for high-eight figures". Freestyle also had an output deal withNetflix.[10]The Freestyle purchase was used to bolster an expansion intofilm distribution, via its new Entertainment Studios Motion Pictures division.[18][19]Its first release,47 Meters Down, took in $44 million in box office revenue.[12]
In June 2016, Entertainment Studios acquiredTheGrio, a news website focusing on stories of interest to African Americans.[20]
In mid-September 2017, the company announced plans to launch anover the topsports streaming service known as Sports.tv.[21]
On March 22, 2018, Entertainment Studios announced its intent to acquireThe Weather Channel's television assets from anNBCUniversal/Bain Capital/Blackstone Inc.partnership. The actual value was undisclosed, but was reported to be around $300 million; the channel'snon-television assets, which were separately sold to IBM two years prior, were not included in the sale.[3]In September 2018, Entertainment Studios announced that it had arranged $500 million worth ofcredit facilitiesthroughDeutsche BankSecurities,Jefferies Financial Group, Brightwood Capital Advisors andComerica. Allen explained that these funds were to be used for further "large-scale" acquisitions, productions, and other general expenses.[12][22]In an interview withVariety, Allen stated that he was "not a seller", and that he was "one or two acquisitions away from being a fairly large company".[12]
On May 3, 2019, it was announced that, under the subsidiary Diamond Sports Group, Entertainment Studios would be an equity and content partner inSinclair Broadcast Group's acquisition ofFox Sports Networks(now known asBally Sports).[23]On May 6, 2019, Entertainment Studios announced that it would expand into television station ownership by establishing the new unit, Allen Media Broadcasting. In June 2020, Comcast agreed to carry Entertainment Studios' Comedy.TV, JusticeCentral.TV, Recipe.TV, and The Weather Channel, and to retransmission consent for the Allen Media Broadcasting television stations, as part of a settlement of the Supreme Court racial discrimination lawsuit.[24]
In May 2021, Allen sued fast food chainMcDonald'sfor $10 billion, alleging that the company "intentionally discriminated against Entertainment Studios and Weather Group through a pattern of racial stereotyping and refusals to contract" for advertising across its properties.[25][26]
In July 2022, Allen Media Group acquiredBlack News Channelout of bankruptcy fromShahid Khanfor $11 million;[27]it was discontinued as a separate service, with its carriage merged into TheGrio.TV.[28][29]
Beginning in late April 2024, Allen Media Group laid off about 300 employees, or around 12 percent of its staff, throughout all of its operating divisions. The company's explanation for the staff reduction is to better position themselves for further growth.[30]Further layoffs took place in January 2025, with announced plans to lay off nearly all meteorologists from its local television stations in favor of centralizing weather coverage at The Weather Channel.[31][32]However, due to public feedback, Allen Media Group quickly changed its plan and will retain some local meteorology teams.[33]
Entertainment Studios has historically been known for itssyndicatedprograms, which are distributed using abarteredmodel that does not require stations to pay a rights fee. The company sells national advertising inventory guaranteeing an audience in aggregate across all of its programs, andshares the revenuewith stations.[34]Allen explained toBloombergin 2013 that this business model was attractive to stations that cannot afford to acquire programs from the syndication market, and that "we offer, across all our television shows, probably 20 million to 25 million viewers a week".[34]
The company has employed various cost-cutting techniques, including using non-union staff, and streamlining productions to reduce their complexity—a technique that also allows it to produce programming at an accelerated pace.[34]A prominent example of these practices are present in the company'scourt shows, which are dramatized with actors rather thanarbitration-basedlike other popular entries in the genre; Allen explained that with this model, "we don't have the cost of airfare, hotels, security; we don't have the costs of the claims, the settlements."[34]The studio's first production—Entertainers with Byron Allen—bypassed budget constraints by filming interviews atpress junkets, using equipment that was provided byfilm studiosfor use by the media.[35]
These practices have allowed some of Entertainment Studios programs to bring in sizable amounts of advertising revenue, even with clearances inlesser-viewed time slotssuch aslate night, or without having produced new episodes in an extended period.[34]

In January of that year, on his film distribution model, Allen said:[19]
We're chasing the studio crumbs. They don't want movies that do $40 million to $60 million. We totally will be good with those numbers, and that is what we're pursuing. Our thing is we are really big on slow roll-outs and small releases. Our philosophy—we believe in wide releases. We like to have movies that are 1,500–4,000 screens and we are chasing what the studios don't want. They're chasing much bigger. And we're going to take their crumbs and make a gourmet meal. And then eventually we'll move on to chasing more than their crumbs. But today we're chasing the crumbs.
