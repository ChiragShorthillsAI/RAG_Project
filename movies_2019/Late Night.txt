Late Nightis a 2019 Americancomedy-dramafilm directed byNisha Ganatraand written byMindy Kaling. It starsEmma Thompsonas a popular TV host who hires a new writer (played by Kaling) to keep from getting replaced.Max Casella,Hugh Dancy,John Lithgow,Denis O'Hare,Reid Scott, andAmy Ryanalso star.
The project was first announced in 2016, withFox 2000 Picturesset to produce Kaling's script andPaul Feigsigned on to direct. In August 2017, Ganatra replaced Feig and the film was picked up byFilmNation Entertainment. Much of the cast joined in April 2018 and filming began later that month inNew York City. Following its premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 25, 2019,Amazon Studiosbought the domestic distribution rights for a record $13 million.
Late Nightwas theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its social satire and commentary, screenplay, as well as Thompson's performance.[4]For her performance, Thompson received a nomination at the77th Golden Globe AwardsforBest Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.
Katherine Newbury, aBritishcomedienne, is an acclaimedlate-night talk showhost with an extensive career in comedy, but her show's ratings have seen a steady decline over the past decade. The network's president, Caroline Morton, tells Katherine to fix up her show or she will be replaced.
In an attempt to revamp the show, Katherine has Molly Patel hired to her writing staff, mainly on the basis that she is anIndian-Americanwoman while all remaining writers are white men. Although Molly has little experience in comedy and initially struggles, she proves her worth by giving Katherine good material to work with on her show as well as ideas on how to reach out to a bigger audience. The results prove successful.
Katherine learns that Caroline wants to pick young, popular comedian Daniel Tennant to replace her as the new host. Katherine resists, as Daniel's comedy is vulgar and misogynistic. With backup from her writers, Katherine defies the network's demands and decides on air to continue her career.
An email from one of the writers, Charlie, gets leaked, in which it is revealed that Katherine had an affair with him after her husband Walter was initially diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. In the midst of the drama, Katherine fires Molly after she criticizes her for her response to the news. 
Eventually, Katherine makes amends with Walter and the other writers and admits her affair to her audience. Her sincerity and passion for the show convinces Caroline to let her stick around, and Katherine later apologizes to Molly, hiring her back. The show continues to stay on air.
One year later, the show's team has diversified, Molly is promoted to co-lead monologue writer, and there is a hint of romantic relationship with co-writer Tom. Katherine's show is more successful than ever.

Late Nighthad its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 25, 2019.[15]Shortly after,Amazon Studiosacquired U.S. distribution rights to the film for $13 million, the largest sum paid for U.S.-only distribution at the festival.[16]
The film began its U.S. theatrical play with a limited release on June 7, 2019,[17]in Los Angeles and New York City, and expanded to the rest of the US the following weekend.[18]Amazon's marketing budget for the film amounted to roughly $35 million.[19]
Late Nightgrossed $15.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $6.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $22.4 million.[3]In June 2019, the film was estimated to have lost Amazon $40 million due to the cost of acquisition and marketing.[20][21]
In its limited opening weekend, the film made $249,694 from four theaters, for a per-venue average of $62,414, the second-best of 2019.[22]The film expanded on June 14, opposite the openings ofMen in Black: InternationalandShaft, and was projected to gross $5 million from 2,218 theaters over the weekend.[23]It ended up making $5.1 million, finishing ninth. While in-line with projections, the opening was viewed as disappointing given the positive critical reception and the studio's cost of acquisition. However,Deadline Hollywoodnoted the film was essentially an advertisement for streaming onAmazon Prime, and audiences may have been waiting to see it later.[19]It made $2.6 million the following weekend, dropping 51% to 12th.[24]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 80% of 300 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.80/10.

A.O. ScottofThe New York Timesdescribed the film's humor as "sharp" yet "cruelty-free", and wrote, "[Late Night] argues that entertainment benefits from the presence of different faces and voices not by preaching but by example."[27]Owen GleibermanofVarietymagazinecalled the film "lively yet scattershot" and praised Thompson's performance, saying "Thompson truly seems like a born talk-show host. Even when she's just riffing, she groundsLate Nightin something real."[28]
Anthony Kaufman ofScreenDailyalso praised Thompson for "a memorable performance as the abrasive 'cold witch,' as someone describes her, perhaps even outdoing Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly inThe Devil Wears Pradaas a delightfully wicked woman of power."[29]Leah Greenblatt ofEntertainment Weeklyalso praised Thompson's performance, saying her "gravitas holds the center," and that "the best scenes inLate Nightare consistently the ones where the movie's main stars spar and banter and intermittently connect." Greenblatt praised director Nisha Ganatra for refreshing classic romantic comedy tropes, but added that the tone is at times "scattershot and sometimes too sitcom-ish."[30]
Alissa Wilkinson ofVoxsaid "Late Nightis a workplace comedy that feels like a cousin ofThe Devil Wears Prada, and its greatest strength is its two lead characters." She also wrote, "Late Nightfeels underwritten in some spots, but it's surprising in others—an unfussy, entertaining comedy with some serious matters on its mind."[31]Richard LawsonofVanity Fairdescribed it as "a genial, funny movie, not a mile-a-minute behind-the-cameras gag-fest (hyphens!) like30 Rock, but an amiable workplace comedy that finds personal definition in its influences."[32]Sheila O'Malley ofRogerEbert.comrated the film three and a half out of four stars, specifying that is "an earnest and funny comedy, with very sharp teeth."[33]

Nisha Ganatra(born June 25, 1974)[1]is a Canadian-American film director, screenwriter, producer, and actress of Indian descent. She wrote, directed, and produced the independent comedy dramaChutney Popcorn(1999) and later directed the independent filmCosmopolitan(2003) and the romantic-comedyCake(2005). Ganatra has directed for numerous television shows, includingThe Real World,Transparent,You Me Her,Better Things,andBrooklyn Nine-Nine. She also directed thecomedy-dramasLate Night(2019) andThe High Note(2020). Ganatra served as a consulting producer on the first season ofTransparent,[2]for which she was nominated for the 2015Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series.[3]
Ganatra explored her interest in film through acting and then decided to make the switch to pursue film-making as she wanted to effect cultural change.[1]
Ganatra began her film-making journey by studying atThe University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).Though she wasn't studying film, she explored her interest by sneaking into screenwriting classes which eventually led her to creating short films.[1]
She moved toNew York Cityto pursue a film degree atNew York University Film School (NYU).During her time there, she created a short filmJunky Punky Girlz(1997) which won NYU's Tisch Fellowship[1]and most outstanding short film fromPBS.[1]Ganatra graduated from theNew York University(NYU)Tisch School of the Arts.[4]
While in film school, Ganatra directed several episodes of MTV's long-running television seriesThe Real Worldin 2001.[5]Prior to this she had written and directed two shorts and her critically acclaimed independent filmChutney Popcorn(1999).[5]
Ganatra is part of a mentorship program with NBC which seeks to provide talented female directors with the same opportunities as their male counterparts. This program selects female directors to be given the opportunity to shadow up to three episodes of an NBC series. The participants will then be able to direct at least one episode of the series in which she has been shadowing.[6]
When Ganatra was on the hunt for a cinematographer, she began to notice that the men's reels were far superior compared to the women's reels.[7]As a female director herself, she was accustomed to being overlooked in the hiring process in favor of men. She realized that the men had better reels not because they were more talented, but instead, because they had been given bigger budgets, better equipment, larger crews, and elaborate productions.[7]This motivated Ganatra to hire a female cinematographer and strive to hire female crews. In 2020, it was reported thatABChad put into development a single-camera matchmaking comedy written, directed, and produced by Ganatra.[8]
Ganatra is out and identifies as a lesbian.[9][10]
