Years later, Peggy and Socket are gone while the now teenage Darlin' has developed aferalpersonality while sporting mid-thigh lengthcopperhair while the Woman has calf-length hair. She and the Woman are walking through the forest naked despite the wintry conditions. One day at the insistence of the Woman, Darlin' arrives outside a hospital and accidentally gets struck by an ambulance. After being treated at the hospital, she is sent to a Catholicboarding schoolcalled St. Philomena's, where the staff and other students attempt to civilize her.
A nurse named Tony who was the first to find and befriend her at the hospital tries to look out for her, but is repeatedly turned away by the school for beinggay. Though she has forgotten how to speak, she is renamed Darlin' after the name on her bracelet. She slowly regains her ability to speak, her hair is cut to mid-back length, and she befriends some of the other students, especially a trouble-makingtomboynamed Billy, but has trouble adjusting to modern life and is disturbed by the school's teachings about theDevil.

A few months ago, she and the Woman captured a skier and Darlin' mated with him before the Woman killed him. The Woman made her go to civilization so that she could deliver the baby safely. However, due to the school's teachings and what happened to Peggy, Darlin' believes the baby inside her is the Devil and repeatedly pleads with God to save her.
When Darlin' is about to receive herFirst Communion, she attempts eithersuicideor to induce amiscarriageby drinkingbleach, but all it does is make her sick. During the ceremony, Sister Jennifer plays a recording of the bishop confessing his crimes which makes several people walk out in disgust. Darlin' bites a chunk out of his hand, but suddenly goes intolabor. The Woman and the homeless prostitutes storm the church and the Woman kills the bishop while the prostitutes escape.
Tony, his boyfriend Robert, Sister Jennifer, and Billy help deliver Darlin's child which is a girl. Darlin' tells the Woman to take the baby far away.
