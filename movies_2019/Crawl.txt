He rose to international stardom for his 2003 horror filmHaute Tension(known asHigh Tensionin the US andSwitchblade Romancein the UK). He has also directed the filmsThe Hills Have Eyes(2006),Mirrors(2008),Piranha 3D(2010),Horns(2013) andCrawl(2019).
Aja's pseudonymous surname is formed from the initial letter of each of the three parts of his real name. He was born in Paris, France, and is the son of Jewish Frenchpied-noirdirectorAlexandre Arcadyand French cinema critic Marie-Jo Jouan.[citation needed]
Aja acted at a very young age in minor roles in his father's films such asLe Grand Carnaval[fr], and the twoLe Grand Pardon[fr]films.
He made his directorial debut at the age of eighteen with the short filmOver the Rainbow, which received aCannes Film FestivalGolden Palm Awardnomination for best short film.

FromFuriaand his next features, he frequently works withGrégory Levasseuras writers such as inThe Hills Have Eyes,Mirrors,P2, andPiranha 3D. Levasseur also made his works as production designer too.
Aja directedHaute Tension, which released in 2003 in France and in 2005 in the US, and placed Aja on the map of thehorror moviegenre. The French slasher, though sticking to horror conventions, pushed the envelope of gore and tension. The film is an unauthorized reinterpretation of the novel "Intensity", byDean Koontz. Favouring make-up effects over computer-generated imagery, the film quickly found respect among horror fans. It was released in the US asHigh Tension, after some editing. The film was nominated for the grand prize at theAmsterdam Fantastic Film Festival, and earned Aja awards for Best Direction and Best Fantasy Film at theSitges Film Festival.
After seeingHigh Tension, American directorWes Cravenasked Aja to come up with a concept for the remake of his 1977 filmThe Hills Have Eyes. Craven subsequently asked Aja to direct the movie, which was released with an R rating in the US after extensive editing.[1][failed verification]
His next project was a horror film entitledMirrors, about a mysterious mirror that brings out the worst aspects of people whenever they look at themselves in it. The film is a remake of theK-HorrorfilmInto the Mirror. Aja directedPiranha 3D, a horror movie about prehistoric piranhas in Arizona.[2]It is a remake of the 1978 filmPiranha.[3]
Because Aja was working onMirrors, he did not directThe Hills Have Eyes 2, which was released on 10 March 2007.[4][failed verification]
In 2004, Aja was named byVarietyon the Ten Directors to Watch list. He is a member of the so-calledSplat Pack, a term coined by film historianAlan JonesinTotal Filmmagazine for a new wave of directors making brutally violent horror films.
