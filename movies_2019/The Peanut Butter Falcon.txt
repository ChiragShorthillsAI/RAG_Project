The film went on to become asleeper hit, grossing over $23 million, making it the highest grossing independent film of the year, and received praise from critics.[5]
Zak, a young man withDown syndrome, escapes from a state-run care facility with the help of his elderly roommate, to train as a professional wrestler under the tutelage of his hero, the Salt Water Redneck. Meanwhile, Tyler, a man fired for bringing in illegal crab catches, burns the gear of his rivals, Duncan and Ratboy, and flees himself.
While on the run, Zak and Tyler meet, and embark on a journey to the Salt Water Redneck's wrestling school in North Carolina. Zak's caretaker at the nursing home, Eleanor, sets out to find Zak and return him safely to the facility. Zak and Tyler become friends while traveling. Tyler teaches Zak various life skills, including how to use a shotgun, and eventually takes on the role of his coach, getting him in shape for his wrestling endeavors. They build a raft and begin traveling by water. Eleanor soon finds them, but after learning her boss intends to send Zak to a more severe form of confinement, joins them to travel south. That night, Duncan and Ratboy catch up with the trio, and Zak defends them with a shotgun.
When they reachAyden, North Carolina, Tyler learns that the Salt Water Redneck has retired and closed the school, but convinces him to resurrect his alter ego for Zak. Salt Water trains Zak as a wrestler, and quickly puts Zak on a local fight card, which he believes he has rigged for Zak's safety and success. However, when the fight happens, Zak's opponent, Sam, does not hold back, and proceeds to beat him. As Tyler attempts to intervene, Duncan and Ratboy arrive, and Duncan hits Tyler on the head with a tire iron, knocking him unconscious right as Zak manages to lift Sam overhead and throw him forcefully out of the ring, something Salt Water had told him was impossible. The film ends with Tyler healing from the injury, as Eleanor drives him and Zak to Florida, implying the start of a new life for the three of them as a family.
The film is a modern retelling of theHuckleberry Finnstory, which takes Gottsagen's own desire to be an actor and changes it into a quest to become a wrestler.[6]Nilson and Schwartz met Gottsagen at a camp for actors with disabilities around 2011 inVenice, California, and he expressed interest in them making a film with him. After shooting a $20,000 proof-of-concept video, with producer David Thies, the duo received funding for the film to star Gottsagen.[7]Shia LaBeouf,Dakota JohnsonandBruce Dernjoined the cast for the film in June 2017.[8]In July 2017, production began inGeorgia.[9]Later that month,John Hawkes,Jon Bernthal,Thomas Haden Church,Mick Foley,Jake RobertsandYelawolfjoined the cast of the film.[9]

The soundtrack brings together bluegrass, folk songs, and spirituals, for a mix of contemporary and timeless. The soundtrack contains original music composed byZach Dawes, Jonathan Sadoff ofThenewno2, andNoam PikelnyandGabe WitcherofPunch Brothers, as well as new and classic songs fromSara Watkins,Colter Wall, Chance McCoy ofOld Crow Medicine Show,Gregory Alan Isakov,Ola Belle Reed, andthe Staple Singers.

Peter Debruge ofVarietypraised the performances, saying "In Gottsagen, we get a performer who appears to be playing an earnest, unfiltered version of himself, while in LaBeouf, there are layers at play. Oddly enough, both approaches result in a kind of spontaneous unpredictability." He called the film "a feel-good niche indie with its priorities in the right place."[20]Sheri Linden ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote, "[Gottsagen's] sensibility infuses the modern-day fable with an engaging forthrightness. But the unequivocal material often sticks close to the surface, and the film built around him, for all its physical sweep, can feel constricted by obviousness."[21]
David Ehrlich ofIndieWirecalled it "a warm (if somewhat overcooked)dramedy" while David Fear ofRolling Stonefelt that the climax veered close tomagical realism.[22][23]
The film won twenty awards and received sixteen nominations:
