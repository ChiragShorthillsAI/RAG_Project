The Kitchenis a 2019 Americancrime filmwritten and directed byAndrea Berloffin her directorial debut. It is based on theDC/Vertigo Comicslimited seriesof the same name by Ollie Masters andMing Doyle. The film starsMelissa McCarthy,Tiffany Haddish, andElisabeth Mossas the wives of Irish American mobsters who take over organized crime operations in New York'sHell's Kitchenin the late 1970s, after theFBIarrests their husbands. The film also featuresDomhnall Gleeson,James Badge Dale,Brian d'Arcy James,Jeremy Bobb,Margo Martindale,Common, andBill Campin supporting roles.
Produced byNew Line Cinema,Bron Creative, and Michael De Luca Productions, the film was theatrically released in the United States on August 9, 2019, byWarner Bros. Pictures. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, who criticized the convoluted plot, and grossed $16 million against its $38 million budget, making the film abox-office bomb.
InHell's Kitchen1978, three women are married to members of theO'Carroll crime family. Kathy is married to Jimmy, a kind man who is increasingly disillusioned with the mob; Ruby is married to Kevin, the son of boss Helen O'Carroll; and Claire is married to Rob, who frequently beats and abuses her.
One night, the men are arrested in a sting by FBI agents and are each sentenced to three years in prison. Jack "Little Jackie" Quinn assumes Kevin's role in the family and assures the wives that they'll be cared for, but provides them barely enough to live on. When the women discover that many of the businesses that pay the family protection money are upset with Little Jackie forcing them to pay more, they persuade the owners to start paying them instead and provide other favors for their neighbors, making a profit and earning the respect of the community. Jackie finds out and confronts the women, but is subsequently assassinated by Gabriel O'Malley, a disgraced Irish mob enforcer called in by Ruby. With Jackie out of the way and Gabriel backing them up, the women effectively control the family, while Gabriel and Claire begin a relationship.
After successfully "persuading" the local Jewish community to only hire Irish American Union workers to construct their buildings, the women are ordered to meet with Alfonso Coretti, the head of Brooklyn'sItalian Mafiawho is furious with Irish Americans encroaching on his territory. He insists that they start dealing with him and reveals that their husbands are set to be released in four months, which they hadn't realized. Knowing that they are in a precarious position, Coretti says he'll support them and split control of the city in return for Italian Americans getting construction jobs in Hell's Kitchen. The women agree knowing they have no other choice. Ruby subsequently kills Helen in a rage when she learns that her mother-in-law disapproves of her being married to Kevin and would almost certainly force him to divorce her when he returns.
Four months pass and the husbands are released; Kevin is determined to reassert his power as Helen's heir, Jimmy pressures Kathy to help him leave their life of crime and start over, and Rob is furious that Claire has left him for Gabriel. When Rob strikes Claire for refusing to take him back, she pulls a gun from under her pillow and kills him. Coretti then contacts the women and warns them that Kevin, backed by other members of the family, has ordered them to be whacked for the deaths of Helen and Rob. Ruby then pays the Coretti family to have her husband and his friends murdered, but Kathy makes her drop Colin, whom she is fond of, from the list. The hit goes through, but Claire is then killed by Colin in an act of revenge.
After Claire's funeral, Kathy realizes that Ruby has been secretly keeping an FBI agent on the family's payroll. Ruby explains that she set up their husbands to be arrested, as Kevin refused to let her have a role in the family. Kathy later finds that Jimmy is being sheltered by the Coretti family and taken their children with him out of anger for Kathy not respecting his wishes and not treating him as an equal in their relationship. Feeling betrayed, Kathy informs Coretti that her husband no longer has the family's protection, and Jimmy is whacked.
Ruby asks Kathy to meet her so they can discuss what to do next. When Kathy arrives, she finds that Ruby is waiting with Gabriel to kill her so she can take over as sole boss. Having anticipated this, Kathy reconciles with the O'Carroll family and brings all of their muscle as backup to the meeting. Gabriel admits that with Claire dead, he no longer has any ties to the mob and deserts Ruby. Kathy tells Ruby that from now on, they will share the responsibility of leading the family. The film ends with Kathy and Ruby making plans to expand their territory to Uptown.

Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chroniclewrote: "Speaking of female gangsters, no review ofThe Kitchenshould overlook Margo Martindale, who steals every scene she's in as a mob matriarch – a gravelly voiced monster with a gutter mouth and a big photo of John F. Kennedy on her wall. Martindale gets to be evil and has as much fun onscreen as she can without smiling."[27]

It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros.

Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]

He made hisBroadwayacting debut on the playBetween Riverside and Crazy(2023), which won aPulitzer Prize for Drama.[14]
Common was born on March 13, 1972, at the Chicago Osteopathic Hospital in Chicago'sHyde Parkneighborhood. He is the son of educator and former principal ofJohn Hope College PreparatoryHigh School, Mahalia Ann Hines, and formerABAbasketball player turned youth counselorLonnie Lynn.[15]Lynn shares the same first name as his father, grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather.[16]He is known by his middle name, Rashid, to his family and friends.[17]Lynn's godfather is basketball playerSpencer Haywoodwho was a teammate of his father on theDenver Rockets.[16]
Lynn was raised in theCalumet Heightsneighborhood.[18][19][20][21]His father left the family because of his drug and alcohol addictions while Lynn was young.[16]When he was aged two, Lynn's father attempted to take him and his mother to Seattle where he had arranged a tryout with theSeattle SuperSonics.[16]His father was arrested when the family stopped at a motel in Wisconsin and charged with false imprisonment.[22]
Lynn's parents divorced when he was six years old, resulting in his father moving toDenver, Colorado. This left Lynn to be raised by his mother; however, his father remained active in his life, and was able to get him a job with theChicago Bullsas a teenager. Lynn attendedFlorida A&M Universityfor two years under a scholarship and majored inbusiness administration.[23]
Lynn began rapping in the late 1980s, while a student atLuther High School Southin Chicago, when he, along with two of his friends, formed C.D.R., a rap trio that opened for acts such asN.W.AandBig Daddy Kane.[24]When C.D.R dissolved by 1991, Lynn began a solo career under the stage name ofCommon Sense. After being featured in theUnsigned Hypecolumn ofThe Sourcemagazine, he debuted as a solo artist in 1992 with the single "Take It EZ", followed by the albumCan I Borrow a Dollar?.
With the 1994 release ofResurrection, Common Sense achieved a much larger degree of critical acclaim which extended beyond the Chicago music scene. The album sold relatively well and received a strong positive reaction amongalternativeandunderground hip hopfans at the time.Resurrectionwas Common Sense's last album produced almost entirely by his long-time production partner,No I.D., who would later become a mentor to a youngKanye West.
In 1996, Common Sense appeared on theRed Hot Organization's compilation CD,America Is Dying Slowly(A.I.D.S.), alongsideBiz Markie,Wu-Tang Clan, andFat Joe, among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as "a masterpiece" byThe Sourcemagazine. He would later also contribute to theRed Hot Organization'sFela Kutitribute album,Red Hot and Riotin 2002. He collaborated withDjelimady Tounkaraon a remake of Kuti's track, "Years of Tears and Sorrow".
The song "I Used to Love H.E.R." fromResurrectionignited afeudwithWest Coast rap groupWestside Connection. The lyrics of the song criticized the path hip hop music was taking, utilizing a metaphor of a woman to convey hip hop[25]and were interpreted by some as directing blame towards the popularity of West Coastgangsta rap. Westside Connection first responded with the 1995 song "Westside Slaughterhouse," with the lyrics "Used to love H.E.R., mad cause I f*cked her". "Westside Slaughterhouse" also mentioned Common Sense by name, prompting the rapper to respond with the scathingPete Rock-produced attack song "The Bitch in Yoo". Common Sense and Westside Connection continued to insult each other back and forth before finally meeting withLouis Farrakhanand setting aside their dispute. Following the popularity ofResurrection, Common Sense was sued by anOrange County-basedreggaeband with thesame name, and was forced to shorten his moniker to simply Common.[26]
Initially scheduled for an October 1996 release, Common released his third album,One Day It'll All Make Sense, in September 1997. The album took a total of two years to complete and included collaborations with artists such asLauryn Hill,De La Soul,Q-Tip,Canibus,Black Thought,Chantay Savage, andQuestlove– a future fellow member of theSoulquariansoutfit. The album, which made a point of eschewing any gangsterism (in response to questions about his musical integrity), was critically acclaimed and led to amajor labelcontract withMCA Records. In addition to releasingOne Day, Common's first child, daughter Omoye Assata Lynn, was born shortly after the release of the album.
As documented by hip-hop journalist Raquel Cepeda, in the liner notes for the album, this event had a profound spiritual and mental effect on Common and enabled him to grow musically while becoming more responsible as an artist. She writes:
Common addresses family ethics several times onOne Day..., and the album sleeve is decorated with old family photos, illustrating the rapper's childhood, as well a quote from1 Corinthians 13:11, which summarizes the path to manhood:
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.
FollowingOne Day..., Common signed a major label record deal withMCA Recordsand relocated from Chicago to New York City in 1999. He began recording almost exclusively with a loose collective of musicians and artists (dubbed the "Soulquarians" by central figureQuestlove) throughout 1999, and made a few sporadic guest appearances onThe Roots'Things Fall Apart, and theRawkus Recordscompilation,Soundbombing 2.
In 2000, his fourth album,Like Water for Chocolate, was released to mass critical acclaim.Executive producedby Questlove and featuring significant contributions byJ Dilla, (who helmed every track except – "Cold Blooded", "Geto Heaven Part II", "A Song For Assata", "Pop's Rap Part 3...All My Children" & theDJ Premier-produced track "The 6th Sense"),Like Water for Chocolatetranspired to be a considerable commercial breakthrough for Common, earning the rapper his firstgoldrecord, and greatly expanding his fanbase among critics and listeners alike.
With both artists hailing from theGreat Lakes regionof the United States (Chicago and Detroit, respectively), Common andJ Dillaestablished their chemistry early on. Both became members of theSoulquarianscollective, and collaborated on numerous projects together, even placing one song, "Thelonius", on both theSlum VillagealbumFantastic, Vol. 2, and Common'sLike Water for Chocolate. As Dilla's health began to decline from the effects ofLupus Nephritis, he relocated to Los Angeles, and asked Common to make the move with him as a roommate (Dilla would later lose his battle with the rare disease).[27]
This album saw Common exploring themes (musically and lyrically), which were uncommon for a hip-hop record, as he does on the song "Time Travelin' (A Tribute To Fela)"; a homage toNigerianmusic legend, and political activistFela Kuti. The most popular single from the album "The Light" was nominated for aGrammy Award.
In 2002, Common released his fifth album,Electric Circus. The album was highly anticipated and praised by many critics for its ambitious vision. However, it was not as commercially successful as his previous album,Like Water for Chocolate, selling under 300,000 copies. An eclectic album,Electric Circusfeatured fusions of several genres such as hip hop, pop, rock, electronic, and neo-soul. The album's style tended to divide critics; some praised its ambitious vision while others criticized it for the same reason. Most of the criticism tended to revolve around the album's experimental nature; some felt Common had strayed too far from his previous sound. This was Common's second and last album for MCA, and the label's final release prior to its absorption into Geffen Records.
Around this time, Common appeared as a guest performer on singer and fellow SoulquarianBilal'sLove for Salealbum, recording a remake of the 1977Fela Kutisong "Sorrow, Tears & Blood".[28]Bilal also featured onElectric Circus, the first of many future collaborations with Common.[29]
In early 2004, Common made an appearance on fellow Chicagoan Kanye West's multi-platinum debut album,The College Dropout(on the song "Get Em High"), and announced his signing to West's then-newfound labelGOOD Music. West had been a longtime fan of Common and the two even participated in a friendly on-air MC battle, where West took jabs at his lyrical idol for "going soft" and wearing crochet pants (as he does for his appearance in the video for theMary J. Bligesong "Dance for Me"). The pair worked together on Common's next album,Be, almost entirely produced by Kanye West, with some help from Common's longtime collaboratorJames Yancey(J Dilla) – also a favorite of West. The album was released in May 2005, and performed very well, boosted by Kanye's involvement and the singles "The Corner", and "Go".Beearned Common the second gold record of his career, with sales topping out at around 800,000 copies.The Sourcemagazine gave it a near-perfect 4.5 mic rating,XXLmagazine gave it their highest rating of "XXL", and AllHipHop gave the album 4 stars. The album was also nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2006.
Following the release ofBein 2005, several mixed-race artists from the UK hip-hop scene took exception to Common's comments about interracial relationships on the song "Real People."Yungun,Doc Brownand Rising Son recorded a track over an instrumental version of "The Corner" named "Dear Common (The Corner Dub)." Common states that he has heard of the track but never actually taken the time to listen to it, and has not retaliated in song.[30]
Common's seventh LP titledFinding Foreverwas released on July 31, 2007. For this album, he continued his work withKanye West, as well as other producers such asWill.i.am,Devo Springsteen,Derrick Hodge, andKarriem Riggins, as well as the onlyJ Dilla-produced track, "So Far To Go". The album features guest spots from artists such asDwele,Bilal,D'Angelo, and UK pop starletLily Allen. The first single from the album was "The People" b/w "The Game". West predicted thatFinding Foreverwould win the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.[31]The album was nominated for Best Rap Album, but did not win, losing to West'sGraduation; however, Common did win his second Grammy for "Southside," which won the 2008 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by Duo or Group.
On July 31, 2007, Common performed a free concert in Santa Monica, California, on the 3rd Street Promenade to promote the release ofFinding Forever. Common explained to the audience that the title "Finding Forever" represented his quest to find an eternal place in hip-hop and also his wishes to be an artist for the rest of his life. The album debuted at #1 on the nationalBillboard200charts.
In an August 2007 interview withXXL, rapperQ-Tipof the groupA Tribe Called Queststated that he and Common were forming a group called 'The Standard', and were planning to record an album to be produced by Q-Tip; however, this never came to fruition.[32]
Common was instrumental in bridging the trans-Atlantic gap by signing UK's Mr. Wong and J2K to Kanye West's Getting Out Our Dreams recording outfit. Common met the pair during his tour in the UK earlier on in the year. It is speculated that the deal is not only to bring the UK and US hip hop genres together but that to rival Syco Music's cross-Atlantic success with Leona Lewis. He also has a deal with Zune mp3 players. In 2008 Common made an estimated 12 million dollars, making him equal in earnings toEminemandAkon, tied for the 13th highest grossing Hip-Hop artist.[citation needed]
The eighth album from Chicago hip-hop artist Common was originally scheduled to be released on June 24, 2008, under the nameInvincible Summer, but he announced at aTemple Universityconcert that he would change it toUniversal Mind Control.[33]The release date was pushed back to September 30, 2008, due to Common filmingWanted. The release date was set for November 11, 2008, however, it was once again pushed back to December 9, 2008.
The album'seponymouslead single"Universal Mind Control", was officially released on July 1, 2008, via the US iTunes Store as part ofThe Announcement EP(sold asUniversal Mind Control EPin the UK). The song features Pharrell, who also produced the track.The Announcement EPincluded an additional track titled "Announcement", also featuring Pharrell. The video for the lead single was filmed in September by director Hype Williams. In 2009, Common was prominently featured throughout his GOOD Music label-mateKid Cudi's debut albumMan on the Moon: The End of Day, as a narrator and featured artist. In late 2009, it was revealed Common was nominated for twoGrammysat the52nd Annual Grammy Awards, includingBest Rap Performance by a Duo or Groupfor "Make Her Say", alongside Kid Cudi and Kanye West, as well asBest Rap AlbumforUniversal Mind Control.
American producerNo I.D., stated that he andKanye Westwould be producing Common's albumThe Dreamer/The Believer.[34]In July 2011, it was announced that No I.D. would be the album's sole producer.[35]Common made an appearance onThe Jonas Brothers' most recent album,Lines, Vines and Trying Timesas a guest rapper for the group's 2009 song, "Don't Charge Me for the Crime."[36]
On July 6, 2011, Common released his first single, titled "Ghetto Dreams", from his next album. A second single, "Blue Sky", was released on October 4, 2011. On December 20, 2011, Common released his ninth solo album, titledThe Dreamer, The Believer. Although he left GOOD Music in 2011, Common was featured on the label's first compilation album, 2012'sCruel Summer. Common released a song entitled "Sweet", fromThe Dreamer/The Believer, which included lyrics critical of rappers who sing, although this criticism was not aimed specifically at Canadian recording artistDrake.[37]Drake took offense and responded by releasing "Stay Schemin'", a song withRick RossandFrench Montana.[38]Common fans only had to wait two-and-a-half days for him to respond to Drake'sdiss track. On February 13, 2012, Common commented on the feud by saying "It's over. But it was all in the art of hip hop. He said some things to me so I had to say some things back...I wouldn't say [he started it] but I know I heard something that I felt was directed to me so I addressed it. That's all. But you know, thank God we were able to move forward from it and all is good."[39]
After a quiet 2012, Common announced he would release anextended play(EP) in January 2013, and his firstmixtapein April.[40]In February 2013, Common announced his tenth solo studio album would be released in September 2013 and will featureKanye Westand production from Kanye West andNo I.D.[40]Later on September 8, 2013, he gave an update to his projects saying the previously announced EP would be released soon, and would feature a song with new Def Jam signeeVince Staples. He also told HipHopDX, his tenth solo studio album would be released in early 2014.[41]
On January 6, 2014, Common announced his tenth studio album to be titledNobody's Smilingand would be produced entirely by longtime collaborator 'No I.D.'.
