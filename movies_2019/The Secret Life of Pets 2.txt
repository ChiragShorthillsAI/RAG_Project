With help from Norman, she unintentionally causes the cats to hail her as their "queen", allowing her to retrieve Busy Bee.

He also voiced theMinionsin the first two films in theDespicable Mefranchise and Norman inThe Secret Life of Petsfranchise, the former which he co-created with Coffin. Renaud received nominations for twoAcademy Awardsfor theIce Ageshort filmNo Time for Nuts(2006) andDespicable Me 2(2013).
Chris Renaud was born in 1966 inBaltimore. At age 15, he moved toBethlehem, Pennsylvaniawhen his father, who worked forBethlehem Steel, was transferred to their corporate headquarters.[2]Renaud has said he had mixed feelings with the move, saying it upset him but it was also one of the best things in his life because it showed him "that there was a great, big world out there". He was the artist for the high school yearbooks and newspaper and had aspirations of creating comic books.[2]He graduatedParkland High SchoolinAllentown, Pennsylvaniain 1985 and attendedBaum School of Artin Allentown, where he received a $1,000 scholarship.[3]
After graduating fromSyracuse Universitywith an illustration degree in 1989,[4]Renaud began work as agraphic designer[5]in the sports entertainment industry. He has createdlogosandmascotsfor NFL Properties, the NBA, and Foot Locker. After working as a designer and illustrator for a variety of publications and agencies, Chris began drawing and writingcomic books. Working for bothMarvel ComicsandDC Comics, his projects included illustrating Marvel'sStarfleet Academyand pitching the story concept that evolved intoBatman: Cataclysm[6]which depicted a devastating earthquake hitting Gotham City. This yearlong tale across all Batman-related comics resulted in increased sales and visibility for the renowned character and set up the acclaimed "No Man's Land" storyline that followed.
As the production designer on the Disney Channel'sThe Book of Pooh, Renaud transitioned into the world of children's television. Since that groundbreaking project, he has been able to design virtual sets and puppet characters forBear in the Big Blue House,LazyTown, Curious Pictures andSony Pictures Animation. WithIt's a Big Big World, which aired from 2006 to 2010 onPBS, he took the lead in visual development and design of every aspect of this Emmy-nominated children's program.[citation needed]
Renaud worked forBlue Sky Studiosas a story artist on the filmsRobots,Ice Age: The Meltdown, and the Dr. Seuss adaptationHorton Hears a Who!. He wrote and co-directed the animated shortNo Time for Nuts, which received anAnnie Awardand a 2007 Oscar nomination for animated short film.[7]It was also included in theAnimation Show of Showsin 2006.
Renaud moved toParisto work forIllumination Entertainment.[8]While directingDespicable Me(2010), Renaud, along with his directing partnerPierre Coffin, began to develop Gru's famous henchmen, the Minions. Initially, there were discussions about making the creatures robots.[9]Then Renaud hit upon the notion that they could be mole people and slapped goggles on them. "I did a very rough, ugly, little sketch combining some elements into a mole person and sent it to Pierre, who then discussed it with Eric Guillon, who was the art director and final designer of the Minions, and they took some of those ideas and together we came up with what the Minions look like". The more the filmmakers worked on the little guys, the more yellow and more cylindrical they became. "Eric continued to refine the idea and made [the Minions] closer to children. He made them funnier and simpler and a brighter color". Among the inspirations for the Minions were theOompa-LoompasfromWilly Wonkaand theJawasfromStar Wars, as well as silent screen starsBuster KeatonandCharlie Chaplin, and Warner Bros. cartoon characters.[10]
In a four-picture directing deal,[11]he directedDespicable Me(2010),Dr. Seuss' The Lorax(2012),Despicable Me 2(2013),[12]andThe Secret Life of Pets(2016), in which two pet dogs, Max and Duke, have to put their quarrels behind when they find out that a bunny, Snowball, is building an army of abandoned pets to take revenge on all pet owners and their pets.[13]Renaud signed a new contract with Illumination Entertainment in 2013, saying: "I love working with Illumination. They've given me an unparalleled opportunity to keep directing one movie after another. Very often animation directors make one movie and then spend the next five years developing another one. But I'm in the unique position of being able to keep working and keep making movies... So I feel very fortunate."[8]
In a 2012 interview, he mentioned that he readDr. Seussbooks as a child, which influenced his work with films such asThe Lorax.[14]When asked if he would shift towards live-action movies, he said that he has thought about it and it may happen in the future but he feels comfortable with animation for now.[6]
Renaud executive-producedMinionsin 2015,Despicable Me 3in 2017, andThe Grinchin 2018, and producedMinions: The Rise of Gruin 2022. He returned to direct the sequelsThe Secret Life of Pets 2in 2019 andDespicable Me 4in 2024.[15]

Carvey was a finalist for the hosting role on theNickelodeonTV game showDouble Dare. He ultimately withdrew his name from consideration after he was cast onSaturday Night Live. The job would go toMarc Summers.[18]
In 1986, Carvey became a household name when he joined the cast ofNBC'sSaturday Night Live. He, along with newcomersPhil Hartman,Kevin Nealon,Jan Hooks, andVictoria Jackson, helped to reverse the show's declining popularity and madeSNL"must-see" TV once again. An important part of the show's revival was Carvey's breakout character,the Church Lady, the uptight, smug, and pious host ofChurch Chat.[19]Carvey said he based the character on women he knew from church while growing up, who would keep track of other churchgoers' attendance. He became so associated with the character that later cast members such asChris Farleyreferred to Carvey simply as "The Lady". The Church Lady's discontinuation was mentioned in a sketch which satirized the filmMiserywith hostRoseanne Barrplaying the role ofAnnie Wilkes.[20]
Carvey's other original characters included Garth Algar (fromWayne's World), who was based on his brother;[21]Hans (from "Hans and Franz"); the Grumpy Old Man (fromWeekend Updateappearances); and Ching Chang, a Chinese poultry store owner.

I go into this bar to get a phone charger for an Uber. He follows me into the bar, and told me I'm too drunk to go inside. [...] 'If I can't be on the street, where do you want me to be?' I ask him.
