Isabel Andersen, co-founder of an orphanage inIndia, must travel toNew Yorkto meet a potential benefactor, millionaire CEO Theresa Young. Isabel is unwilling to travel due to her responsibilities at the orphanage and because she does not want to leave Jai, a boy whom she found on the street when he was a year old. He is the closest child in the orphanage to Isabel, and doesn't want Isabel to leave, but Theresa insists on an in-person meeting. Reluctantly, Isabel agrees and goes to the meeting, which takes place the day before the wedding of Theresa's daughter Grace. Theresa invites Isabel to the wedding as a courtesy and Isabel feels obliged to attend.
At the wedding, Isabel is surprised to see Theresa's husband is her teenage sweetheart Oscar Carlson, now a renowned visual artist. During Grace's wedding toast, she discovers that Grace is not Theresa's biological daughter, but is Oscar's. Isabel soon realizes that Grace is in fact her birth daughter by Oscar, whom they had placed for adoption as teenagers. Isabel returns to the house the day after the wedding to confront Oscar and learns that after placing the baby for adoption, he changed his mind within the 30-day grace period and reclaimed the infant Grace without informing her. Isabel then forces Oscar and Theresa to also inform Grace, who had always been told her biological mother had died.
Theresa encourages Isabel to get to know Grace and reconnect with Oscar, and eventually decides to dramatically increase her donation to the orphanage, thereby forcing Isabel to extend her stay in New York. Eventually, Theresa makes her donation, as well as a newly established fund in Isabel and Grace's name, contingent on Isabel moving to New York permanently.
Mistrustful of Theresa's real motives, Isabel angrily confronts her and learns that Theresa is dying. Theresa admits she has known about Isabel's link to Oscar and Grace all along and arranged the whole charade to install Isabel as a new mother figure to both Grace and Theresa's own eight-year-old twin boys. Oscar discovers his wife's illness around the same time and eventually tells Grace, who is already struggling with doubts about her recent marriage and the news that Isabel is her biological mother.
Theresa dies soon after and the family scatter her ashes. Isabel then returns to India for a visit to the orphanage and Jai. The film ends with Jai and his friends playing football in the orphanage.

Variety's Peter Debruge wrote: "This sensitive remake of Susanne Bier's overcooked Danish Oscar nominee has shrewdly been flipped from a male-driven meller to an emotional showcase for Michelle Williams and Julianne Moore." Debruge praises the film for its subtlety, as it "strips away anything excessive, allowing subtext to surface in the quiet spaces between dialogue."[14]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "Bart Freundlich's American remake of the Bier film flips the gender of the main characters, yielding predictably strong performances from Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams but otherwise removing the teeth from a melodrama that grows increasingly preposterous as it crawls toward its weepy conclusion."[15]Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film 2 out of 4, and wrote: "It's a morose and slow-paced and off-putting drama, in which even the joyous moments seem brittle and draped in melancholy."[16]David Fear ofRolling Stonegave the film a mixed review but praised Williams: "This is Williams' spotlight, and it's worth slogging through some of the soapier-to-sludgier aspects to watch her ply her craft."[17]

Freundlich has been in a relationship with actressJulianne Mooresince 1996, when they met on the set ofThe Myth of Fingerprints(1997).
When casting Moore's character, Mia, Freundlich explains that he "was looking for someone who had a lot of complication, a lot of sadness under the surface, and portrayed very, very little of it in her face." During filming, Freundlich recalls seeing Moore standing outside, exposed to the elements without a coat: "I came up to her and stood with my back to the wind. I didn't want her to be cold, and I also didn't want to put my arm around her, or smother her, because I didn't know her that well...Even though I couldn't have articulated it then, I understood that I could keep her warm up to a point. But then the rest was going to be for her to do. We connected in that moment on an unspoken level, where she knew I saw that flame in her, and understood it, and was willing not to suffocate it but to protect it."[8]
Moore and Freundlich married on August 23, 2003.[9]The couple have a son and a daughter.[9]Moore has appeared in all of Freundlich's feature films with the exception ofCatch That Kid(2004),The Rebound(2009), andWolves(2016).
