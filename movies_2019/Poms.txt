The film follows a group of women from a retirement community who decide to start a cheerleading squad. It was theatrically released in North America on May 10, 2019, bySTX Entertainment.
Martha, a woman dying ofcancer, decides to forego further treatment, and relocates from her apartment inNew Yorkto aretirement communitycalled Sun Springs inGeorgia. When Martha arrives at Sun Springs, she meets community supervisor Vicki, who gives Martha a tour of the community, where she explains that every resident must belong to one of the community's clubs.
Martha moves into her new house and promptly meets her next door neighbor Sheryl. Later at night, Martha is unable to sleep due to loud noise coming from Sheryl's house, forcing her to call the community's security chief Carl to stop the noise. But Sheryl and her party sneak into Martha's house to evade Carl, where she convinces a reluctant Martha to allow them to hide there. From that night on, Sheryl becomes interested in being Martha's friend and invites her to various activities, but Martha resists.
Martha watches a television program aboutfireworksbeing used forfunerals, and makes plans to use fireworks for her own funeral. A few days later, she accepts Sheryl as a friend, and while getting to know each other, Sheryl learns that Martha was acheerleader, where she had to quit before her first game to care for her ailing mother. Sheryl says that Martha should try to be a cheerleader again. After thinking about it, Martha goes to see Sheryl at a high school where she works as a substitute teacher and convinces Sheryl to help her start up a cheerleading club in Sun Springs.
After convincing Vicki to allow them to start the club and to recruit the minimum requirement of eight members, Martha and Sheryl holdtryouts. Six women join: Olive, Alice, Ruby, Evelyn, Phyllis and Helen. Martha hires Sheryl's teenage grandson Ben to be theirDJ. As the group commences practicing, it quickly becomes difficult for them due to their age and physical conditions. When Vicki tells them they have to find a new place to practice, Sheryl reacts by getting them a spot at apep rallyat the high school. In the locker room before the rally, they get teased by a group of younger cheerleaders, particularly Chloe, one of Sheryl's students. During the pep rally, Martha's group performs okay until Helen hurts her ankle. When Helen is taken to the hospital, they discover from Ben that a video of them at the pep rally has gone viral. In addition with Helen's overbearing son Tom threatening the group with alawsuitdue to her injury, Vicki and other members of the community vote unanimously to disband the club.
With the group going back to their routine lives, Martha invites Sheryl to her house for a drink. When Sheryl watches the video of them, she hears a girl's voice and recognizes it as Chloe, leading her and Martha to blame Chloe for posting the video. They go to Chloe's house and berate her, but Chloe, who has become sympathetic for them, starts crying because she didn't know that her friends would post the video. When Chloe apologizes, Martha and Sheryl forgive her and tell her that they're reassembling the cheerleading squad and need Chloe's help. Chloe agrees to become theirchoreographerand theircoach. Back at Sun Springs, Martha inspires her teammates to come back together so they can prove everybody wrong and show that they can be a team if they work together.
With Chloe coaching them, the group improves greatly as they prepare for an upcomingcheerleading competition. Meanwhile, Martha's cancer, which she has kept secret from the group, has progressed. After leaving a group party, she collapses while walking home. In the hospital, she tells Sheryl that she's not going to the competition and isscared about dying. Sheryl urges Martha to continue her cheerleading despite her suffering.
The next day, Martha and the group rescue Helen from Tom by springing her from her bedroom and escapes from a pursuing Vicki and a sympathetic Chief Carl as they make their way to the competition. Many men from the community, including Chief Carl, gladly attend the competition. The group performs successfully and wins the audience and the other cheerleading teams over. The next scene shows a firework going off, indicating that Martha has died and had her funeral.
A year later, the group has added new members to their squad. They get ready to perform in another cheerleading competition, both as acharity benefitfor cancer and in memory of Martha. During the end credits, video clips show other people doing the same kind of dancing that Martha and the group have done.

In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014 (the "S" standing for Simonds, the company's founder; the "T" standing forTPG Growth, whose managing partner McGlashan helped launch the company; and the "X" standing for "secret project"),[2]with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[3][4]Investors in the company includedHony Capital,Tencent,PCCW, TPG Growth,RTL GroupandLiberty Global. Individual investors includeGigi Pritzker,Beau Wrigley, andDominic Ng.[5][6][7]

Keaton is a 1963 graduate ofSanta Ana High SchoolinSanta Ana, California.[13]During her time there, she participated in singing and acting clubs at school, and starred asBlanche DuBoisin a school production ofA Streetcar Named Desire. After graduation, she attendedSanta Ana College, and laterOrange Coast Collegeas an acting student, but dropped out after a year to pursue an entertainment career inManhattan.[14]Upon joining theActors' Equity Association, she changed her surname to Keaton, which was her mother's maiden name, as there was already an actress registered under the name of Diane Hall.[15]For a brief time she also moonlighted at nightclubs with a singing act.[16]She revisited her nightclub act inAnnie Hall(1977),And So It Goes(2014), and a cameo inRadio Days(1987).

As opposed to going it on my own and forging my path to create a wonderful performance without the help of anyone. I always need the help of everyone!"[16]According to fellow actorJack Nicholson, "She approaches a script sort of like a play in that she has the entire script memorized before you start doing the movie, which I don't know any other actors doing that."[17]
In 1968, Keaton became an understudy for the part of Sheila in the original Broadway production ofHair.[18]She gained some notoriety for her refusal to disrobe at the end of Act I when the cast performs nude, even thoughnudityin the production was optional for actors (those who performed nude received a $50 bonus).[11][19]After acting inHairfor nine months, she auditioned for a part inWoody Allen's production ofPlay It Again, Sam. After nearly being passed over for being too tall (at 5 ft 8 in (173 cm), she is 2 inches (5 cm) taller than Allen), she won the part.[4]She went on to receive aTony Awardnomination for aBest Featured Actress in a Playfor her performance inPlay It Again, Sam.
The next year, Keaton made her film debut inLovers and Other Strangers. She followed with guest roles on the television seriesLove, American Style,Night Gallery, andMannix. Between films, Keaton appeared in a series ofdeodorantcommercials.
Keaton's breakthrough role came two years later when she was cast asKay Adams, the girlfriend and eventual wife ofMichael Corleone(played byAl Pacino) inFrancis Ford Coppola's 1972 filmThe Godfather. Coppola noted that he first noticed Keaton inLovers and Other Strangers, and cast her because of her reputation foreccentricitythat he wanted her to bring to the role[20](Keaton claims that at the time she was commonly referred to as "the kooky actress" of the film industry).[11]Her performance in the film was loosely based on her real-life experience of making the film, both of which she has described as being "the woman in a world of men."[11]The Godfatherwas an unparalleled critical and financial success, becoming the highest-grossing film of the year and winning the1972Academy Award for Best Picture.
Two years later, she reprised her role as Kay Adams inThe Godfather Part II. She was initially reluctant, saying, "At first, I was skeptical about playing Kay again in theGodfathersequel. But when I read the script, the character seemed much more substantial than in the first film."[14]InPart II, her character changed dramatically, becoming more embittered about her husband's criminal empire. Even though Keaton received widespread exposure from the films, some critics felt that her character's importance was minimal.Timewrote that she was "invisible inThe Godfatherand pallid inThe Godfather Part II, but according toEmpiremagazine, Keaton "proves the quiet lynchpin which is no mean feat in [the] necessarily male dominated films."[21][22]
Keaton's other notable films of the 1970s included many collaborations with Woody Allen. She played many eccentric characters in several of his comic and dramatic films, includingSleeper,Love and Death,Interiors,Manhattan,Manhattan Murder Mysteryand the film version ofPlay It Again, Sam, directed byHerbert Ross. Allen has credited Keaton as his muse during his early film career.[23]
In 1977, Keaton won theAcademy Award for Best Actressfor Allen'sromantic comedy-dramaAnnie Hall, one of her most famous roles.Annie Hall, written by Allen andMarshall Brickmanand directed by Allen, was believed by many to be an autobiographical exploration of his relationship with Keaton. Allen based the character of Annie Hall loosely on Keaton ("Annie" is a nickname of hers, and "Hall" is her original surname). Many of Keaton's mannerisms and her self-deprecating sense of humor were added into the role by Allen. (DirectorNancy Meyershas claimed: "Diane's the most self-deprecating person alive."[24]) Keaton has also said that Allen wrote the character as an "idealized version" of herself.[25]The two starred as a frequentlyon-again, off-againcouple living in New York City. Her acting was later summed up byCNNas "awkward, self-deprecating, speaking in endearing little whirlwinds of semi-logic",[26]and by Allen as a "nervous breakdown in slow motion."[27]Annie Hallemerged as a major critical and commercial success and won theAcademy Award for Best Picture. Of Keaton's performance, feminist film criticMolly Haskellwrote, "Keaton took me by surprise inAnnie Hall. Here she blossomed into something more than just another kooky dame—she put the finishing touches on a type, the anti-goddess, the goldenshiksafrom the provinces who looks cool and together, who looks as if she must have a date on Saturday night, but has only to open her mouth or gulp or dart spastically sideways to reveal herself as the insecure bungler she is, as complete a social disaster in her own way as Allen's horny West Side intellectual is in his."[28]In 2006,Premieremagazine ranked Keaton inAnnie Hall60th on its list of the "100 Greatest Performances of All Time", and noted:
It's hard to play ditzy. ... The genius of Annie is that despite her loopy backhand, awful driving, and nervous tics, she's also a complicated, intelligent woman. Keaton brilliantly displays this dichotomy of her character, especially when she yammers away on a first date with Alvy (Woody Allen), while the subtitle reads, 'He probably thinks I'm a yoyo.' Yo-yo? Hardly.[29]
Keaton's eccentric wardrobe inAnnie Hall, which consisted mainly of vintage men's clothing, including neckties, vests, baggy pants, andfedorahats, made her an unlikely fashion icon of the late 1970s. A small amount of the clothing seen in the film came from Keaton herself, who was already known for hertomboyishclothing style years beforeAnnie Hall, andRuth Morleydesigned the film's costumes.[30]Soon after the film's release, men's clothing and pantsuits became popular attire for women.[31]She is known to favor men'svintage clothing, and usually appears in public wearing gloves and conservative attire. (A 2005 profile in theSan Francisco Chronicledescribed her as "easy to find. Look for the only woman in sight dressed in a turtleneck. On a 90-degree afternoon in Pasadena.")[32]
Her photo byDouglas Kirklandappeared on the cover of the September 26, 1977, issue ofTimemagazine, with the story dubbing her "the funniest woman now working in films."[21]Later that year she departed from her usual lighthearted comic roles when she won the highly coveted lead role in the dramaLooking for Mr. Goodbar, based on thenovelbyJudith Rossner. In the film, she played aCatholicschoolteacher for deaf children who lives a double life, spending nights frequenting singles bars and engaging inpromiscuoussex. Keaton became interested in the role after seeing it as a "psychological case history."[33]The same issue ofTimecommended her role choice and criticized the restricted roles available for female actors in American films:
A male actor can fly a plane, fight a war, shoot a badman, pull off a sting, impersonate a big cheese in business or politics. Men are presumed to be interesting. A female can play a wife, play a whore, get pregnant, lose her baby, and, um, let's see ... Women are presumed to be dull. ... Now a determined trend spotter can point to a handful of new films whose makers think that women can bear the dramatic weight of a production alone, or virtually so. Then there is Diane Keaton inLooking for Mr. Goodbar. As Theresa Dunn, Keaton dominates this raunchy, risky, violent dramatization of Judith Rossner's 1975 novel about a schoolteacher who cruises singles bars.[21]
In addition to acting, Keaton has said she "had a lifelong ambition to be a singer."[34]She had a brief, unrealized career as a recording artist in the 1970s. Her first record was an original cast recording ofHair, in 1971. In 1977 she began recording tracks for a solo album, but the finished record never materialized.[4]
Keaton met with more success in the medium of still photography. Like her character inAnnie Hall, Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling in the late 1970s, she began exploring her avocation more seriously. "Rolling Stonehad asked me to take photographs for them, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, what I'm really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in these old hotels.' So I began shooting them", she recalled in 2003. "These places were deserted, and I could just sneak in anytime and nobody cared. It was so easy and I could do it myself. It was an adventure for me."Reservations, her collection of photos of hotel interiors, was published in book form in 1980.[35]
WithManhattan(1979), Keaton and Woody Allen ended their long working relationship; it was their last major collaboration until 1993. In 1978, she became romantically involved withWarren Beatty, and two years later he cast her opposite him in the epic historical dramaReds. In the film, she playedLouise Bryant, a journalist and feminist, who flees her husband to work with radical journalistJohn Reed(Beatty) and later enters Russia to find him as he chronicles theRussian Civil War. Beatty cast Keaton after seeing her inAnnie Hall, as he wanted to bring her natural nervousness and insecure attitude to the role. The production ofRedswas delayed several times following its conception in 1977, and Keaton almost left the project when she believed it would never be produced. Filming finally began two years later.
In a 2006Vanity Fairstory, Keaton described her role as "the everyman of that piece, as someone who wanted to be extraordinary but was probably more ordinary ... I knew what it felt like to be extremely insecure."Assistant directorSimon Relph later stated that Louise Bryant was one of Keaton's most difficult roles, and that "[she] almost got broken."[36]Redsopened to widespread critical acclaim, and Keaton's performance was highly praised in particular.The New York Timeswrote that Keaton was "nothing less than splendid as Louise Bryant– beautiful, selfish, funny and driven. It's the best work she has done to date."[37]Roger Ebertcalled Keaton "a particular surprise. I had somehow gotten into the habit of expecting her to be a touchy New Yorker, sweet, scared, and intellectual. Here, she is just what she needs to be: plucky, healthy, exasperated, loyal, and funny."[38]Keaton received her second Academy Award for Best Actress nomination for her performance.
The following year, Keaton starred in the domestic dramaShoot the MoonoppositeAlbert Finney. The film follows George (Finney) and Faith Dunlap (Keaton), whose deteriorating marriage, separation, and love affairs devastate their four children.Shoot the Moonreceived mostly positive reviews from critics and Keaton's performance was again praised. InThe New Yorker,Pauline Kaelwrote that the film was "perhaps the most revealing American movie of the era", and that Keaton "may be a star without vanity: she's so completely challenged by the role of Faith that all she cares about is getting the character right. Very few young American movie actresses have the strength and the instinct for the toughest dramatic roles—intelligent, sophisticated heroines.Jane Fondadid, around the time that she appeared inKluteandThey Shoot Horses, Don't They?, but that was more than ten years ago. There hasn't been anybody else until now. Diane Keaton acts on a different plane from that of her previous film roles; she brings the character a full measure of dread and awareness and does it in a special, intuitive way that's right for screen acting."[39]David DenbyofNew Yorkmagazine called Keaton "perfectly relaxed and self-assured", adding, "Keaton has always found it easy enough to bring out the anger that lies beneath the soft hesitancy of her surface manner, but she's never dug down and found this much pain before.[40]Keaton's performance garnered her a secondGolden Globenomination in a row forBest Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, followingReds.
1984 broughtThe Little Drummer Girl, Keaton's first excursion into the thriller and action genre.The Little Drummer Girlwas both a financial and critical failure, with critics claiming that Keaton was miscast for the genre, such as one review fromThe New Republicclaiming that "the title role, the pivotal role, is played by Diane Keaton, and around her the picture collapses in tatters. She is so feeble, so inappropriate."[41]But the same year, she received positive reviews for her performance inMrs. Soffel, a film based on the true story of a repressed prison warden's wife who falls in love with a convicted murderer and arranges for his escape. Two years later, she starred withJessica LangeandSissy SpacekinCrimes of the Heart, adapted fromBeth Henley's Pulitzer Prize-winning play into a moderately successful screen comedy. Keaton's performance was well received by critics, and Rita Kempley ofThe Washington Postwrote, "As the frumpy Lenny, Keaton eases smoothly from New York neurotic to southern eccentric, a reluctant wallflower stymied by, of all things, her shriveled ovary."[42]
In 1987, Keaton starred inBaby Boom, her first of four collaborations with writer-producerNancy Meyers. She played a Manhattan career woman who is suddenly forced to care for a toddler. A modest box-office success, Keaton's performance was singled out by Kael, who described it as "a glorious comedy performance that rides over many of the inanities in this picture. Keaton is smashing: the Tiger Lady's having all this drive is played for farce and Keaton keeps you alert to every shade of pride and panic the character feels. She's an ultra-feminine executive, a wide-eyed charmer, with a breathless ditziness that may remind you ofJean ArthurinThe More The Merrier."[43]That same year, Keaton made a cameo in Allen's filmRadio Daysas a nightclub singer. 1988'sThe Good Motherwas a financial disappointment (according to Keaton, the film was "a Big Failure. Like, BIG failure"),[44]and some critics panned her performance; according toThe Washington Post, "her acting degenerates into hype—as if she's trying to sell an idea she can't fully believe in."[45]
In 1987, Keaton directed and edited her first feature film,Heaven, a documentary about the possibility of anafterlife. It met with mixed critical reaction, withThe New York Timeslikening it to "a conceit imposed on its subjects."[46]Over the next four years, Keaton directed music videos for artists such asBelinda Carlisle, including the video for Carlisle's chart-topping hit "Heaven Is a Place on Earth," two television films starringPatricia Arquette, and episodes of the seriesChina BeachandTwin Peaks.
By the 1990s, Keaton had established herself as one of the most popular and versatile actors in Hollywood. She shifted to more mature roles, frequently playing matriarchs of middle-class families. Of her role choices and avoidance of becomingtypecast, she said: "Most often a particular role does you some good and Bang! You have loads of offers, all of them for similar roles ... I have tried to break away from the usual roles and have tried my hand at several things."[47]
Keaton began the decade withThe Lemon Sisters, a poorly-received comedy-drama that she starred in and produced, which was shelved for a year after its completion. In 1991 she starred withSteve Martinin the family comedyFather of the Bride. She was almost not cast in the film, asThe Good Mother's commercial failure had strained her relationship withWalt Disney Pictures, the studio of both films.[44]Father of the Bridewas Keaton's first major hit after four years of commercial disappointments. She reprised her role four years later in thesequel, as a woman who becomes pregnant in middle age at the same time as her daughter. ASan Francisco Examinerreview of the film was one of many in which Keaton was once again compared toKatharine Hepburn: "No longer relying on that stuttering uncertainty that seeped into all her characterizations of the 1970s, she has somehow become Katharine Hepburn with a deep maternal instinct, that is, she is a fine and intelligent actress who doesn't need to be tough and edgy in order to prove herfeminism."[48]
Keaton reprised her role of Kay Adams in 1990'sThe Godfather Part III, set 20 years after the end ofThe Godfather, Part II. In 1993 Keaton starred in black comedy mysteryManhattan Murder Mystery, her first major film role in a Woody Allen film since 1979. Her part was originally intended forMia Farrow, but Farrow dropped out of the project after breaking up with Allen.[49]Todd McCarthyofVarietycommended her performance, writing that she "nicely handles her sometimes buffoonish central comedic role".[50]David AnsenofNewsweekwrote, "On screen, Keaton and Allen have always been made for each other: they still strike wonderfully ditsy sparks".[51]For her performance, Keaton was nominated for theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.
In 1995, Keaton directedUnstrung Heroes, her first theatrically released narrative film. The film, adapted fromFranz Lidz's memoir, starred Nathan Watt as a boy in the 1960s whose mother (Andie MacDowell) is diagnosed with cancer. As her sickness advances and his inventor father (John Turturro) grows increasingly distant, the boy is sent to live with his two eccentric uncles (Maury ChaykinandMichael Richards). Keaton switched the story's setting from the New York of Lidz's book to the Southern California of her own childhood, and the four mad uncles were reduced to a whimsical odd couple.[52]In an essay forThe New York Times, Lidz said that the cinematic Selma had died not of cancer, but of "Old Movie Disease". "Someday somebody may find a cure for cancer, but the terminal sappiness of cancer movies is probably beyond remedy."[53]Unstrung Heroesplayed in a relatively limited release and made little impression at the box office, but the film and its direction were generally well-received critically.[54]
Keaton's most successful film of the decade was the 1996 comedyThe First Wives Club. She starred withGoldie HawnandBette Midleras a trio of "first wives": middle-aged women who had been divorced by their husbands in favor of younger women. Keaton claimed that making the film "saved [her] life."[55]The film was a major success, grossing US$105million at the North American box office,[56]and it developed acultfollowing among middle-aged women.[57]Its reviews were generally positive for Keaton and her co-stars, andThe San Francisco Chroniclecalled her "probably [one of] the best comic film actresses alive."[58]In 1997 Keaton, Hawn and Midler received theWomen in FilmCrystal Award, which honors "outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry."[59]
Also in 1996, Keaton starred as Bessie, a woman withleukemia, inMarvin's Room, an adaptation of the play by Scott McPherson.Meryl Streepplayed her estranged sister, Lee, and had also initially been considered for the role of Bessie. The film also starredLeonardo DiCaprioas Lee's rebellious son.Roger Ebertwrote, "Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems."[60]Keaton earned a third Academy Award nomination for the film, which was critically acclaimed. She said the role's biggest challenge was understanding the mentality of a person with a terminal illness.[11]Keaton next starred inThe Only Thrill(1997) opposite herBaby Boomco-starSam Shephard, and had a supporting role inThe Other Sister(1999).
In 1999, Keaton narrated the one-hour public radio documentary "If I Get Out Alive", the first to focus on the conditions and brutality young people face in the adult correctional system. The program, produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media, aired on public radio stations across the country and was honored with a First Place National Headliner Award and a Casey Medal for Meritorious Journalism.[61]
Keaton's first film of 2000 wasHanging Up, withMeg RyanandLisa Kudrow. She directed the film, despite claiming in a 1996 interview that she would never direct herself in a film, saying "as a director, you automatically have different goals. I can't think about directing when I'm acting."[44]A drama about three sisters coping with the senility and eventual death of their elderly father (Walter Matthau),Hanging Uprated poorly with critics and grossed a modest US$36million at the North American box office.[62]
In 2001, Keaton co-starred with Beatty inTown & Country, a critical and financial fiasco. Budgeted at an estimated US$90million, the film opened to little notice and grossed only US$7million in its North American theatrical run.[63]Peter TraversofRolling Stonewrote thatTown & Countrywas "less deserving of a review than it is an obituary....The corpse took with it the reputations of its starry cast, including Beatty and Keaton."[64]In 2001 and 2002, Keaton starred in four low-budget television films. She played a fanatical nun in the religious dramaSister Mary Explains It All, an impoverished mother in the dramaOn Thin Ice, and a bookkeeper in themobcomedyPlan B. InCrossed Over, she played Beverly Lowry, a woman who forms an unusual friendship with the only woman executed while on death row in Texas,Karla Faye Tucker.
Keaton's first major hit since 1996 came in 2003's romantic comedySomething's Gotta Give, directed byNancy Meyersand co-starringJack Nicholson. Nicholson and Keaton, aged 65 and 56 respectively, were seen as bold casting choices for leads in a romantic comedy.Twentieth Century Fox, the film's original studio, reportedly declined to produce the film, fearing that the lead characters were too old to be bankable. Keaton toldLadies' Home Journal, "Let's face it, people my age and Jack's age are much deeper, much more soulful, because they've seen a lot of life. They have a great deal of passion andhope—why shouldn't they fall in love? Why shouldn't movies show that?"[65]Keaton played a middle-agedplaywrightwho falls in love with her daughter's much older boyfriend. The film was a major success at the box office, grossing US$125million in North America.[66]Roger Ebertwrote, "Keaton and Nicholson bring so much experience, knowledge and humor to their characters that the film works in ways the screenplay might not have even hoped for."[67]Keaton received her fourth Academy Award nomination for her performance.
Keaton's only film between 2004 and 2006 was the comedyThe Family Stone(2005), starring anensemble cast. In the film, scripted and directed byThomas Bezucha, Keaton played abreast cancersurvivor and matriarch of a bigNew Englandfamily that reunites at the parents' home for its annual Christmas holidays.[68]The film released to moderate critical and commercial success,[69]and earned US$92.2million worldwide.[70]Keaton received her secondSatellite Awardnomination for her performance,[71]of which Peter Travers ofRolling Stonewrote, "Keaton, a sorceress at blending humor and heartbreak, honors the film with a grace that makes it stick in the memory."[72]
In 2007, Keaton starred in bothBecause I Said SoandMama's Boy. In the romantic comedyBecause I Said So, directed byMichael Lehmann, Keaton played a long-divorced mother of three daughters, determined to pair off her only single daughter, Milly (Mandy Moore).[73]Also starringStephen CollinsandGabriel Macht, the project opened to overwhelmingly negative reviews, withWesley MorrisofThe Boston Globecalling it "a sloppily made bowl of reheated chick-flick cliches", and was ranked among the worst-reviewed films of the year.[74][75][76]The following year Keaton received her first and onlyGolden Raspberry Awardnomination to date for the film.[71][unreliable source?]InMama's Boy, director Tim Hamilton's feature film debut, Keaton starred as the mother of a self-absorbed 29-year-old (Jon Heder) whose world turns upside down when she starts dating and considers kicking him out of the house. Distributed for a limited release to certain parts of the United States only, the independent comedy garnered largely negative reviews.[77]
In 2008, Keaton starred alongsideDax ShepardandLiv Tylerin Vince Di Meglio'sdramedySmother, playing the overbearing mother of an unemployed therapist, who decides to move in with him and his girlfriend after breaking up with her husband (Ken Howard). As withMama's Boy, the film received a limited release only, resulting in a gross of US$1.8million worldwide.[78]Critical reaction to the film was generally unfavorable.[79]Also in 2008, Keaton appeared alongsideKatie HolmesandQueen Latifahin the crime-comedy filmMad Money, directed byCallie Khouri. Based on the British television dramaHot Money(2001), the film revolves around three female employees of theFederal Reservewho scheme to steal money that is about to be destroyed.[80]
In 2010, Keaton starred alongsideRachel McAdamsandHarrison FordinRoger Michell's comedyMorning Glory, playing the veteran TV host of a fictionalmorning talk showthat desperately needs to boost its lagging ratings. Portraying a narcissistic character who will do anything to please the audience, Keaton described her role as "the kind of woman you love to hate."[81]Inspired byNeil Simon's 1972 Broadway playThe Sunshine Boys,[82]the film was a moderate success at the box office, taking a worldwide total of almost US$59million.[83]Keaton was generally praised for her performance, with James Berardinelli ofReelViewswriting, "Keaton is so good at her part that one can see her sliding effortlessly into an anchor's chair on a real morning show."[84]
In fall 2010, Keaton joined the production of the comedy-dramaDarling CompanionbyLawrence Kasdan, which was released in 2012. Co-starringKevin KlineandDianne Wiestand set inTelluride, Colorado,[85]the film follows a woman, played by Keaton, whose husband loses her much-beloved dog at a wedding held at their vacation home in theRocky Mountains, resulting in a search party to find the pet.[86]Kasdan's first film in nine years, the filmbombed at the US box office, where it scored about US$790,000 throughout its entire theatrical run.[87]Critics dismissed the film as "an overwritten, underplotted vanity project" but applauded Keaton's performance.[88][89]Ty Burr ofThe Boston Globewrote that the film "would be instantly forgettable if not for Keaton, who imbues [her role] with a sorrow, warmth,wisdom, and rage that feel earned [...] Her performance here is an extension of worn, resilient grace."[89]
Also in 2011, Keaton began production onJustin Zackham's 2013 ensemble family comedyThe Big Wedding, a remake of the 2006 French filmMon frère se mariein which she, along withRobert De Niro, played a long-divorced couple who, for the sake of their adopted son's wedding and his very religious biological mother, pretend they are still married.[90]The film received largely negative reviews.[91]
In 2014, Keaton starred inAnd So It Goesand5 Flights Up. InRob Reiner's romantic dramedyAnd So It Goes, Keaton portrayed a widowed lounge singer who finds autumnal love with abad boy(Michael Douglas).[92]The film received largely negative reviews. One critic wrote that "And So It Goesaims for comedy, but with two talented actors stuck in a half-hearted effort from a once-mighty filmmaker, it ends in unintentional tragedy."[93]Keaton co-starred withMorgan FreemaninRichard Loncraine's comedy-drama5 Flights Up, based onJill Ciment's novelHeroic Measures. They play a long-married couple who have an eventful weekend after they are forced to contemplate selling their belovedBrooklynapartment.[94][95]Shot in New York, the film premiered, under its former nameRuth & Alex, at the2014 Toronto International Film Festival.[96]The same year Keaton became the first woman to receive the Golden Lion Award at theZurich Film Festival.[97][98]
Keaton's only film of 2015 wasLove the Coopers, an ensemble comedy about a troubled family getting together for Christmas, for which she reunited withBecause I Said SowriterJessie Nelson.[99]Also starringJohn Goodman,Ed Helms, andMarisa Tomei, Keaton was attached for several years before the film went into production.[99]Her casting was instrumental in financing and recruiting most other actors, which led her to anexecutive producercredit in the film.[99]Love the Coopersreceived largely negative reviews from critics, who called it a "bittersweet blend of holiday cheer",[100]and became a moderate commercial success at a worldwide total of US$41.1million against a budget of US$17million.[101]Also in 2015Netflixannounced the comedyDivanation, for which Keaton was expected to reunite with herFirst Wives Clubco-stars Midler and Hawn to portray a former singing group, but the project failed to materialize.[102]
Keaton voicedamnesiacfish Dory's mother inDisneyandPixar'sFinding Dory(2016), the sequel to the 2003 Pixar animated filmFinding Nemo. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over US$1billion worldwide, the second Pixar film to cross this mark afterToy Story 3(2010). It also set numerous records, including thebiggest animated opening of all time in North America, emerging as the biggest animated film of all time in the US.[103][104]Keaton's other project of 2016 was theHBOeight-part seriesThe Young Pope, in which she plays a nun who raised the newly electedPope(Jude Law) and helped him reach the papacy.[105]The miniseries received two nominations for the69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first Italian TV series to be nominated forPrimetime Emmy Awards.[106]
In 2017, Keaton appeared oppositeBrendan Gleesonin the British dramedy filmHampstead.[107]Based on the life ofHarry Hallowes, it depicts an American widow (Keaton) who helps a local man defending his ramshackle hut and the life he has been leading onHampstead Heathfor 17 years.[108]The specialty release had a mixed reception from critics, who were unimpressed by the film's "deeply mediocre story",[109]but became a minor commercial success.[110]Keaton's only project of 2018 wasBook Club, in which she,Jane Fonda,Candice Bergen, andMary Steenburgenplay four friends who readFifty Shades of Greyas part of their monthlybook cluband subsequently begin to change how they view their personal relationships. The romantic comedy received mixed reviews from critics, who felt thatBook Clubonly "intermittently rises to the level of its impressiveveterancast,"[111][112]but with a worldwide gross of over $100 million, became Keaton's biggest commercial success in a non-voice role since 2003'sSomething's Gotta Give.[113]In 2019, Keaton starred in the comedyPomsas a woman dying of cancer who starts a cheerleading squad with other female residents of a retirement home. The film was a box office disappointment and was negatively received by critics.[114]
Keaton has had romantic associations with several entertainment industry personalities, starting with directorWoody Allenduring her role in the 1969 Broadway production ofPlay It Again, Sam. Their relationship turned romantic following a dinner after a late-night rehearsal. It was her sense of humor that attracted Allen.[115]They briefly lived together during the production, but by the time of the film release of the same name in 1972, their living arrangement became informal.[116]They worked together on eight films between 1971 and 1993, and Keaton has said that Allen remains one of her closest friends.[25]
Keaton also had a relationship with herGodfather TrilogycostarAl Pacino. Theiron-again, off-again relationshipended after the filming ofThe Godfather Part III. Keaton said of Pacino, "Al was simply the most entertaining man... To me, that's, that is the most beautiful face. I think Warren [Beatty] was gorgeous, very pretty, but Al's face is like whoa. Killer, killer face."[117]
Keaton was already datingWarren Beattyin 1979 when they co-starred in the filmReds(1981).[118]Beatty was a regular subject intabloidmagazines and media coverage, and Keaton became included, much to her bewilderment. In 1985,Vanity Faircalled her "the most reclusive star sinceGarbo."[15]This relationship ended shortly afterRedswrapped. Troubles with the production are thought to have strained the relationship, including numerous financial and scheduling problems.[36]Keaton remains friends with Beatty.[25]
In July 2001, Keaton said of being older and unmarried, "I don't think that because I'm not married it's made my life any less. That old maid myth is garbage."[119]Keaton has twoadoptedchildren, daughter Dexter (adopted 1996) and son Duke (adopted 2001). Her father's death made mortality more apparent to her, and she decided to become a mother at age 50.[55]She later said of having children, "Motherhood has completely changed me. It's just about like the most completely humbling experience that I've ever had."[120]
Keaton said she produced her 1987 documentaryHeavenbecause "I was always pretty religious as a kid ... I was primarily interested in religion because I wanted to go to heaven." When she grew up, she becameagnostic.[121]
Keaton has been avegetariansince around 1995.[122][123]She has continued to pursue photography. In 1987, she toldVanity Fair, "I have amassed a huge library of images—kissing scenes from movies, pictures I like.

Kennedywas assassinated. She is an enthusiast ofSpanish Colonial Revival architecture.[126]
Keaton has also been a real estate developer. She has resold several mansions inSouthern Californiaafter renovating and redesigning them. One of her clients wasMadonna, who purchased a $6.5million Beverly Hills mansion from Keaton in 2003.[127]
Keaton wrote her first memoir,Then Again, forRandom Housein November 2011.[128]Much of it relies on her mother's private journals, which include the line "Diane...is a mystery...At times, she's so basic, at others so wise, it frightens me."[129]In 2012, Keaton's audiobook recording ofJoan Didion'sSlouching Towards Bethlehemwas released onAudible.com.[130]Her performance was nominated for a 2013Audie Awardin the Short Stories/Collections category.
Keaton has been called "one of the great American actresses from the heyday of the 1970s", a style icon and a "treasure" with a personal and professional style that is "difficult to explicate and impossible to duplicate."[131][132][133]Many critics have pointed to her versatility in starring in both light comedies and acclaimed dramas.The New York Timesdescribed Keaton as "remarkably skilled" at portraying Woody Allen's "darling flustered muse" in his comedies, as well as "shy, self-conscious women overcome by the power of their own awakened eroticism" in dramatic films likeLooking for Mr. Goodbar,Reds,Shoot the MoonandMrs. Soffel.[134]It also noted Keaton's ability to consistently reinvent and challenge herself on screen, having transitioned from "Allen's ditzy foil" to a "gifted and erotically nuanced character actress" and later "an appealing maternal figure... a woman's woman with a sexy edge."[134][135]
Literary criticDaphne Merkinargued that Keaton remained more popular with audiences than her contemporaries because of her "friendly accessibility" and "charmingly self-effacing" persona, calling Keaton's most "steadfastly glamorous" asset her "megawatt personality, bursting out of her like an uncontrollable force of nature, a geyser of quirkily entertaining traits that fall on the air and lend everything around her a momentary sparkle."[134]InNew Yorkmagazine,Peter Rainerwrote, "In herAnnie Halldays, [Keaton] was famed for her thrown-together fashion sense, and her approach to acting is, in the best way, thrown-together, too. Audiences love her because they identify with the women she plays, who are never all of a piece. Nobody can be grave and goofy all at once like Diane Keaton. In these fractious times, it's the perfect combo for a modern heroine."[136]Famously self-deprecating, Keaton has been noted for her "wry sense of humor" and "eccentric gender-bending style."[137]
Analyzing her on-screen persona, Deborah C. Mitchell wrote that Keaton often played "a complex, modern American woman, a paradox of self-doubt and assurance", which became her trademark. Mitchell suggests that Keaton madeAnnie Halla "critical juncture for women in American culture. In this ism-infected age, Keaton became not just a star but an icon. Annie Hall, and with her Diane Keaton, presented all of the uncertainty and ambivalence of the new breed of women."[138]Likewise, Bruce Weber felt Keaton's eccentricity—"an amalgam of caginess and insecurity" and a "note of comic desperation... her round-cheeked Annie Hall dewiness"—was her gift as a screen comedian.[133]Keaton's Annie Hall is often cited among the greatest Oscar-winning performances in history:Entertainment Weeklyranked it 7th on its "25 greatest Best Actress Winners" list, praising her "loopy mannerisms, jazz-club serenades, and endlessly imitated fashion sense."[139]After seeing her performance inLooking for Mr. Goodbar,Andrew Sarrisremarked, "Keaton is clearly the most dynamic woman star in pictures. And any actress who can bring wit and humor to sex in an American movie has to be blessed with the most winning magic."[140]
When asked what made Keaton funny, Allen said: "My opinion is that with the exception ofJudy Holliday, she's the finest screen comedienne we've ever seen. It's in her intonation; you can't quantify it easily. WhenGroucho MarxorW.C. Fieldsor Holliday would say something, it's in the ring of their voices, and she has that. It's never line comedy with her. It's all character comedy."[133]Charles Shyer, who directed her inBaby Boom, said Keaton was "in the mold of the iconic comedic actressesCarole Lombard,Irene DunneandRosalind Russell."[141]In 2017 Keaton was chosen by the board of directors of theAmerican Film Instituteto receive theAFI Life Achievement Award, whichWoody Allenpresented.[142]
Keaton has received various awards, including anAcademy Award, and aGolden Globe Awardfor her performance inWoody Allen'sAnnie Hall(1977). She also received three more Academy Award nominations, forReds(1981),Marvin's Room(1996), andSomething's Gotta Give(2003).

Because of her father's military career, the family moved frequently during Grier's childhood. In 1956, they moved toSwindonwhere her father worked on an air force base.[8]By Grier's account, hers was one of the only Black families in town, though she recalled that they faced no racism or segregation compared to that in the United States: "They didn't care that I was Black since they hadn't been raised to hate Blacks. Instead, they'd been raised to hate Germans... In the U.S., especially in the South, we were never able to get buses to stop for us, we couldn't eat in certain restaurants, couldn't use certain bathrooms. Up until 1969, there were department stores in which my father and I weren't even allowed to try on clothing."[8][9]
The family returned to the United States in 1958, when Grier's father was transferred to California'sTravis Air Force Base, eventually settling inDenver, nearLowry Air Force Base.[10]Grier spent part of her upbringing on her maternal grandparents'sugar beetfarm in ruralWyoming, where their ancestors had homesteaded after fleeing west via theUnderground Railroadto escape slavery.[11]Grier attendedEast High Schoolin Denver, and appeared in a number of stage productions, as well as participating inbeauty conteststo raise money for collegetuitionatMetropolitan State College.

Her character was advertised in the trailer as the "baddest one-chick hit-squad that ever hit town!". The film, which was filled with sexual and violent elements typical of the genre, was a box-office hit.
