Honey Boyis a 2019 Americandramafilm directed byAlma Har'eland written byShia LaBeouf, loosely based on his childhood and his relationship with his father. The film stars LaBeouf,Lucas Hedges,Noah JupeandFKA Twigs.
LaBeouf originally wrote the script as a form of therapy while in rehab. The project was announced in March 2018, and the cast was filled out over the next two months. Filming took place in Los Angeles over the course of about three weeks.
Honey Boyhad its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 25, 2019, and was released on November 8, 2019, byAmazon Studios. The film received largely positive reviews from critics, who praised Har'el's direction as well as the performances of LaBeouf, Hedges and Jupe.
In 2005, Otis Lort is a movie star who suffers fromalcoholism. He crashes his car, gets into a drunken altercation with the police and is forced to go intorehabilitation.
Dr. Moreno, Otis' counselor, tells him that if he leaves the facility before they say he is ready, the court will send him to prison for his violent offenses. Moreno tells Otis that he hasPTSD, which he denies repeatedly, but she encourages him to look into his past throughexposure therapy.
Going back a decade earlier to 1995, Otis remembers working as achild actor, often accompanied on set by his father James, a formerrodeo clown. James is four years sober but clearly on edge,manicand aggressive. The two live in a meager motel complex where a shy young woman lives across from them. Otis is in theBig Brotherprogram at the behest of his mother, despite James's jealousy. Otis wants to go to abaseballgame with Tom from the program, and James agrees if Tom comes over for a barbecue.
In 2005, Otis is shown communicating with his roommate Percy and continues therapy. He resists the process, finding it unhelpful. Returning to his memories, Otis remembers Tom coming over for the barbecue, along with James throwing him into the pool and violently threatening him. When he is offered a part in a movie that will be shot in Canada, Otis calls his mother, who is unsure if James can accompany him because of his status as aregistered sex offender. This causes James to begin screaming at her via Otis, who has to relay both of his parents' arguments back to each other.
In the present, after resisting therapy yet again, Alec, another counselor, advises him to go into the woods and scream as loud as he can. James is then shown attending anAlcoholics Anonymousmeeting, where he talks about his abusive stepmother, how he got into substance abuse, and how, while he was blacked out, attempted to rape a woman, which got him registered as a sex offender. Alone in his room, Otis spends time with the Shy Girl, where the two cuddle and he gives her money.
James forces Otis to rehearse his scenes over and over again, and he stops to scream at the neighbors for being too loud. Otis asks him to stop and tells him that no one else would hire him due to his status as a sex offender, and that Otis is actually in charge since James is making money off of him. In 2005, Otis thanks Alec for the advice, and continues to work with Dr. Moreno on controlling his anger.
In 1995, Otis finally confronts James and tells him he needs to start being a better father. A furious James hits him, then leaves on his motorcycle to acquire drugs at a strip club. Alone, Otis spends time with the Shy Girl, and the two are caught waking up together the next morning by James. The Shy Girl slaps James and leaves, and James asks Otis how he thinks it would feel to be criticized by his own son, and to have to resort to accepting payment from him. Otis tells James that if he did not receive money, James would not be present.
James takes Otis to a patch ofmarijuanaplants he has been growing off the highway and smokescannabiswith him. Back in the present, Otis revisits the motel, and imagines himself finding his father there in his rodeo clown costume. He tells his father he intends to make a movie about him; James asks him to make him look good. The two ride away on James's motorcycle, which fades into Otis riding away alone.
LaBeouf based the script on his own life, with his character being based on his own father, and the title coming from his childhood nickname.[5][6]LaBeouf wrote the script as a part of his rehabilitation program in Connecticut, where he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and his therapist encouraged him to write about his upbringing.[7]
In March 2018, it was announced thatLucas Hedgesand LaBeouf had joined the cast of the film, withAlma Har'eldirecting from a screenplay written by LaBeouf himself. Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, Daniela Taplin Lundberg, Christopher Leggett would produce the film under their Automatik, Stay Gold Features and Delirio Films banners, respectively. Fred Berger would serve as an executive producer.[8]LaBeouf had shared the screenplay with Har'el, a friend and creative collaborator, who decided that she wanted to direct it.[7]In April 2018,Noah Jupejoined the cast of the film.[9]In May 2018,Clifton Collins Jr.,Maika Monroe,Natasha Lyonne,Martin Starr,Byron BowersandLaura San Giacomojoined the cast of the film.[10][11]In June 2018, it was announced thatFKA Twigshad joined the cast of the film.[12]
Asked about how making a film based on his own life affected his rehab, LaBeouf said:
"It is strange to fetishize your pain and make a product out of it and feel guilty about that. It felt very selfish. This whole thing felt very selfish. I never went into this thinking, 'Oh, I am going to fucking help people.' That wasn't my goal. I was falling apart."[7]
Production began in May 2018, inLos Angeles, California, lasting 19 days.[2][13]
In August 2022, LaBeouf revealed that he had taken creative liberties with the character portrayal of his father andHoney Boywas not an autobiographical depiction of his childhood. He indicated that he had regrets about the abusive nature of the father character toward him in the film, when he actually was "...so loving to me my whole life. Fractured, sure. Crooked, sure. Wonky, for sure. But never was not loving, never was not there. He was always there... and I'd done a world press tour about how fucked he was as a man." LaBeouf stated that he called his father after theHoney Boypremiere and "took accountability for all of that and knew very clearly that I couldn't take it back."[14]
The film had its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 25, 2019.[15]Shortly after,Amazon Studiosacquired distribution rights to the film[16]and eventually released it on November 8, 2019.[17]
Honey Boygrossed $3 million in the United States and Canada,[4]and $258,087 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $3.3 million, against a production budget of $3.5 million.[3][2]The film made $301,075 from four theaters in its opening weekend, considered a "strong" start.[18]It expanded to 17 theaters the following weekend, making $203,272.[19]
Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 235 reviews, and an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Honey Boyserves as an act of cinematic therapy for its screenwriter and subject – one whose unique perspective should strike a chord in audiences from all backgrounds."[20]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[21]
A. A. Dowd ofThe A.V. Clubwrote, "[A]s a glorified form of drama therapy,Honey Boyis fascinating".[22]
Lindsey Bahr ofAssociated PressincludedHoney Boyas number seven on her list of the top 10 motion pictures of 2019.[23]

Har'el is noted for her ability to artistically blur the lines between documentary and fiction. Stephan Holden ofThe New York Timeswrote about Har'el's filmBombay Beach: "[it] looks and feels like a fever dream about an alternate universe. Suffused with a sense of wonder, it hovers, dancing inside its own ethereal bubble".[7]

It's just because I'm mixed race. When I first released music and no one knew what I looked like, I would read comments like: 'I've never heard anything like this before, it's not in a genre.' And then my picture came out six months later, now she's an R&B singer. I share certain sonic threads withclassical music; my song 'Preface' is like ahymn. So let's talk about that. If I was white and blonde and said I went to church all the time, you'd be talking about the 'choral aspect'. But you're not talking about that because I'm a mixed-race girl fromsouth London.[110]
The first singers who influenced Barnett were Billie Holiday,Ella Fitzgerald, andMarvin Gaye.
