Serving as an alternateorigin storyofSanta Clausindependent from the historicalSaint Nicholas of Myraand using a fictional 19th-century setting, the plot revolves around a postman stationed in an island town to the Far North who befriends a reclusive toymaker (Klaus).

In 19th-centuryNorway,[6]the RoyalPostmaster Generalhas enrolled his son, Jesper Johansen, into the Royal Postman Academy. Jesper deliberately underperforms in his training, intending on returning to his privileged lifestyle. Jesper's father gives him an ultimatum, assigning him as the postman of the distant, northern island town ofSmeerensburgand tasking him with establishing a post office there and posting 6,000 letters within a year. If Jesper fails, he will be cut off from the family's fortune.
Jesper finds Smeerensburg comprised almost entirely by two feuding familial clans, the Ellingboes and the Krums, who have been in conflict with each other since the stone age. Desperately seeking letters from the townsfolk to no avail, Jesper finds an isolated house far outside of town, discovering it to be filled with handmade toys and inhabited by an elderly, reclusive woodsman named Klaus. Terrified by Klaus' imposing appearance, Jesper flees, leaving behind a drawing from one of Smeerensburg's Krum children. Klaus forces Jesper to enter the boy’s home to secretly deliver a toy, which delights the child.
Word of the toy delivery spreads to the other children, who go to Jesper the next day believing they will receive a toy if they send Klaus a letter. Jesper capitalizes on the idea to make progress on his goal and asks Klaus if he can donate his toys; Klaus reluctantly agrees, provided they operate at night and Jesper continues to deliver the toys in secret. The Krum boy's toy leads him to play with an Ellingboe girl, much to their clans’ outrage. As more children write letters to Klaus, Jesper tells a boy who had earlier ridiculed him that Klaus knows whenever any child misbehaves and only gives toys to good children. This prompts the children to perform acts of kindness, which gradually inspire the rest of the townsfolk to end their ancient dispute and make Smeerensburg a happy town. The children ask bitter teacher-turned-fishmonger Alva to teach them to read and write so they can send letters; her faith restored, she uses her escape savings to reopen her school.
Noticing that Klaus's toy supply is running out, Jesper tries persuading Klaus to make more toys in time for Christmas, but Klaus refuses; when Jasper happens upon a keepsake of Klaus's late wife Lydia, Klaus forces him away. Motivated by Márgu, aSámigirl who can't write or speak in Norwegian, Jesper works with Alva to help Márgu write a letter asking for a sled, which he then attempts to build alone. Seeing Jesper's effort, Klaus reconciles with him and the two finish the sled. Upon delivering it and seeing Márgu's joy, Jesper is genuinely moved. Klaus reveals he had made the toys for the children he and Lydia hoped to have butcould not conceivebefore she grew sick and died. He agrees to the Christmas plan, and Márgu arrives with the rest of her people to help. As the town and Jesper's relationship with Alva flourish, Jesper finds himself conflicted about whether to leave Smeerensburg.
Meanwhile, family elders Aksel Ellingboe and Tammy Krum form a temporary truce to stop Jesper and Klaus so the families can resume their feud. Together, they discover Jesper's initial motive and forge enough letters to meet well over his target. Jesper's father arrives on Christmas Eve to congratulate his son, inadvertently revealing Jesper's scheme to his friends. Just before they leave town, Jesper's father notices his son's remorse; after a private talk, he allows Jesper to stay. Jesper tries to stop the elders and their angry mob from destroying the Christmas toys, resulting in a chase during which Aksel's daughter Magdalone and Tammy's son Olaf fall in love. Tammy seemingly destroys the toys; however, Alva and Klaus had already replaced the toys withdecoysafter the town's children warned them of the mob's ambush. Still, Jesper's actions have redeemed him to Klaus and Alva, and they then deliver the Christmas presents to the town.
Magdalone and Olaf are married, ending their families' feud much to the elders' annoyance. Jesper marries Alva and they raise two children. He and Klaus continue to deliver presents in Smeerensburg and beyond for eleven years. On the twelfth year, Klaus mysteriously disappears. Every subsequent Christmas Eve, Jesper waits for Klaus, who returns every year to deliver toys across the world.

After setting up his animation studio inMadrid, Spain, director Sergio Pablos, who had worked onDisney Renaissancefilms such asThe Hunchback of Notre Dame,Hercules, andTarzan, decided to develop a newtraditionally-animatedfeature film. Pablos wanted to explore how the medium would have evolved had western animation film studios not switched to producing mostly computer animated films since the 1990s. For the film's look, the studio sought to overcome some of the technical limitations that traditional animation had, focusing on organic andvolumetric lightingand texturing to give the film a unique look, while maintaining a hand-crafted feel. Proprietary tools from Les films du Poisson Rouge, a French company in Angoulême, were used to allow the team to produce a variety of visual development styles, with the aim of getting away from the standardized style of "characters looking like stickers put on painted backgrounds."[7][8]Fellow Disney animatorsJames Baxter, known forBeauty and the Beast, andAndrew Chesworth[9]also worked on the film.[10]
The first teaser for the project was released in April 2012; at the time, the studio was seeking investment, co-production, and distribution partners. It was shopped around to various studios, but most studios rejected the movie viewing it as "too risky."[11]In November 2017,Netflixannounced that they had acquired the global rights toKlaus; at the same time, the casting of Schwartzman, Jones, Simmons, and Cusack was announced along with a Christmas 2019 release date.[12]In March 2019, it was reported that Netflix was planning anOscar-qualifying run forKlausin theaters, and it was listed as one of ten films Netflix was negotiating with chains to give limited releases prior to their online debuts that August.[13][14]
The film is dedicated to animator and scene checker Mary Lescher who died on 2 June 2019 of cancer. She had worked onKlaus, as well atboth Disney Animation andDisneyToon Studiosfrom 1989 to 2006.[15]Pablos said Smeerensburg is a deliberate misspelling ofSmeerenburg, a former Dutch and Norwegian whaling station in the Arctic archipelago ofSvalbard.[16]
Klauswas released theatrically in select theaters on 8 November 2019, and was released digitally throughNetflixon 15 November.[17]It is the first original animated feature film to appear on Netflix.[18]In January 2020, Netflix reported the film was watched by 40 million members over its first four weeks of release.[19]
On review aggregation websiteRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 95% based on 78 reviews with an average rating of 7.7/10. The critical consensus reads "Beautiful hand-drawn animation and a humorous, heartwarming narrative makeKlausan instant candidate for holiday classic status."[20]OnMetacriticthe film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[21]
John DeFore ofThe Hollywood Reportergave the film a positive review, writing: "Sergio Pablos' Klaus invents its own unexpected and very enjoyable origin story for the big guy who gives out toys every Christmas eve. Shaking off most Yuletide cliches in favor of a from-scratch story about how even dubiously-motivated generosity can lead to joy, it contains echoes of other seasonal favorites (especially, in a topsy-turvy way, Dr. Seuss' Grinch) while standing completely on its own."[22]Peter Debruge ofVarietygave the film a mixed review, calling the film over-complicated and saying: "What goodwill the movie does inspire owes more to the splendid visual world than to anything the story supplies."[23]
According to data provided by Netflix to Reuters, the film racked up nearly 30 million views worldwide in its first month.[24]The film beatToy Story 4for Best Animated Film of 2019 onAnimation Magazine.[25]

He commonly used actor-singerFrank Stalloneas anon-sequiturpunchlineand absurdly blamed him for such events astoxic wasteor high unemployment rates.[34]Frank Stallone took no offence, later stating: "He wasn't really attacking me, it was just randomly thrown in there".[35]Nonetheless, Macdonald stopped the Frank Stallone jokes after a 1997 request fromSylvester Stallone, Frank's brother, who was guest host forSNL.[35]
On theWeekend Updateaired on February 24, 1996, Macdonald joked aboutJohn Lotter's sentencing for the murders ofBrandon Teenaand two others:[36]
"And finally, in Falls City, Nebraska, John Lotter has been sentenced to death for attempting to kill three people in what prosecutors called a plot to silence a cross-dressing female who had accused him of rape. Now, this might strike some viewers as harsh, but I believe everyone involved in this story should die."
The comments were met with sharp criticism from activist groups, includingThe Transexual Menace, who threatened to picketSNL.[37]Upon reviewing the show, NBC agreed the line was inappropriate and should not have aired, and said it would ensure that similar incidents would not happen in the future.[38]
After the announcement thatMichael JacksonandLisa Marie Presleyplanned to divorce, Macdonald joked about their irreconcilable differences onWeekend Update. "According to friends, the two were never a good match. She's more of a stay-at-home type, and he's more of a homosexual pedophile."[39]He followed this up a few episodes later with a report about the singer's collapse and hospitalization. Referring to a report that Jackson had decorated his hospital room with giant photographs ofShirley Temple, Macdonald added: "But don't get any ideas: Michael Jackson is ahomosexualpedophile."[40]
In early 1998,Don Ohlmeyer, president of NBC's West Coast division, had Macdonald removed asWeekend Updateanchor, citing a decline in ratings and a drop-off in quality. He was replaced byColin Quinnat theWeekend Updatedesk beginning on the January 10, 1998, episode.[41]
Macdonald believed at the time that the true reason for his dismissal was his series ofO. J.Simpsonjokes during and after thetrial, in which he frequently called him a murderer; Ohlmeyer was a good friend of Simpson and supported him during the proceedings.[8]After being removed from the role, Macdonald went onCBS'sLate Show with David LettermanandHoward Stern'ssyndicated radio show. In both appearances, the hosts accused Ohlmeyer of firing him for making jokes about Simpson.[8]The jokes were written primarily by Macdonald and longtimeSNLwriterJim Downey, who was fired fromSNLat the same time. Downey pointed out in an interview that Ohlmeyer threw a party for the jurors who acquitted Simpson.[9]
Ohlmeyer claimed that Macdonald was mistaken, pointing out he had not censoredJay Leno's many jokes about Simpson onThe Tonight Show.[8]Ohlmeyer stated he was concerned that ratings research showed people turning away from the program during Macdonald's segment; likewise, network insiders told theNew YorkDaily Newsthat Ohlmeyer and other executives had tried several times to get Macdonald to try a different approach onUpdate.[42]
Macdonald remained onSNLas a cast member, but he disliked performing in regular sketches. On February 28, 1998, in one of his last appearances onSNL, he played the host of a fictitious TV series titledWho's More Grizzled?,[43]who asked questions from "mountain men", played by that night's hostGarth Brooksand special guestRobert Duvall. In the sketch, Brooks's character says to Macdonald's character, "I don't much care for you," to which Macdonald replies, "A lot of people don't." He was dismissed shortly thereafter.[44]
The situation re-ignited in early June 1998 when Ohlmeyer prevented NBC from airing advertisements fromMetro-Goldwyn-Mayerfor Macdonald's new filmDirty Workout of retaliation for what he saw as Macdonald's disparagingSNLand NBC with Letterman and Stern.[8]Robert Wright, Ohlmeyer's boss, later overturned the decision not to show ads for the movie on NBC, but did leave in place the ban on playing it duringSNL.[45]Macdonald continued to insist that he did not personally dislike Ohlmeyer but that Ohlmeyer hated him.[45]
Macdonald complained to the New YorkDaily Newsabout NBC's removal of advertising for his film, calling Ohlmeyer a "liar and a thug."[42]He claimed never to have badmouthedSNLor Michaels, who he felt had always supported him. Macdonald pointed out that he had only taken issue with Ohlmeyer, whereas the people taking shots at NBC andSNLwere Letterman, who wanted Macdonald to come to CBS, and Stern, who wanted him to joinhis showoppositeSNL.[45]Macdonald also asserted that Ohlmeyer's influence had resulted in the cancellation of promotional appearances for his film onWNBC'sToday in New York, NBC'sLate Night with Conan O'Brien, and the syndicatedAccess Hollywood(a joint venture between20th Century Televisionand NBC).[42]The shows that Macdonald named denied being influenced by Ohlmeyer. Macdonald said Ohlmeyer was "about a thousand times more powerful than I am. It's difficult for anybody to take my side in this. This guy should get a life, man."[42]
Members of the media found irony in the situation, asDirty Workwas promoted as a "revenge comedy." When an interviewer pointed this out, Macdonald said: "It would be good revenge if everybody went and saw this movie if they want to get revenge against Don Ohlmeyer for trying to ban my ads."[45]In aLate Show with David Lettermaninterview, Macdonald stated that after being dismissed from anchoringWeekend Updateand leavingSNL, he could not "do anything else on any competing show."[46]
In later years, he came to the conclusion that Ohlmeyer had not removed him fromUpdatefor his Simpson material; rather, he felt he was removed because he was seen as insubordinate: "I think the whole show was tired of me not taking marching orders.Lornewould hint at things... I'd do Michael Jackson jokes. And Lorne would say, 'do you really want a lawsuit from Michael Jackson?' And I'd say, 'Cool! That'd be fuckin' cool, Michael Jackson suing me!'"[47]Elsewhere, Macdonald would concede, "In all fairness to him, my Update was not an audience[-]pleasing, warm kind of thing. I did jokes that I knew weren't going to get bigger reactions. So I saw [Ohlmeyer's] point. Why would you want some dude who's not trying to please the audience?"[48]
Macdonald returned toSaturday Night Liveto host the October 23, 1999, show. In his openingmonologue, he expressed resentment at being fired fromWeekend Update, and then he concluded that the only reason he was asked to host was because "the show has gotten really bad" since he left,[49]echoing a perennial criticism of the show.

Speaking about Canada's homegrown comedy industry, Macdonald reflected that he would have liked there to have been more opportunity for him to stay in the country early in his career, stating:
Now I know there's more of, like, an industry there. Like I was happy thatBrent ButtgotCorner Gas. Because he's a really funny guy. But there wasn't that opportunity when I was there. I rememberMike MacDonaldhad oneshort-lived series, but that was about it. Otherwise, there was nothing to do. But it was great with standup. It was way, way better with standup than in the States. Like, I think the standups are generally much better in Canada. Because, like, when I was in Canada, none of us had any ambition to do movies or TV because there were no movies or television. So it was all standup and we just assumed we'd be standups for our whole lives and that was what was fun. And then when I came to the States, I realized, whoa, they don't take their standup very seriously here because they're just trying to do something other than standup and using standup as, like, a springboard to something else that they're generally not as good at.[103]
Reflecting on the state of modern comedy, he bemoaned the influx of dramatic actors into comedy and comedians into dramatic acting.[103]
