Countdownis a 2019 Americansupernatural horror filmdirected and written by Justin Dec, and starringElizabeth Lail,Jordan Calloway,Talitha Bateman,Tichina Arnold,P.J. Byrne,Peter Facinelli,Anne Winters, andTom Segura. The plot follows a group of people who discover amobile appthat correctly tells its users when they are going to die.
Countdownwas theatrically released in the United States on October 25, 2019, bySTX Entertainment. It received negative reviews from critics,[3][4][5][6]but grossed $48 million worldwide against a $6.5 million budget, becoming a commercial success.[7][4][8]
At a party, teenager Courtney is convinced by her friends to download Countdown, an app that seemingly predicts how long a user has left to live. Courtney is startled to see it says she only has three hours left to live. After avoiding getting into a car with her drunk boyfriend Evan, Courtney receives a notification stating she has broken the "user agreement". Returning home, she is attacked by an unseen entity and killed as her timer reaches zero. At the same time, Evan crashes his car and a tree branch impales the seat where Courtney would have been sitting.
Quinn Harris, a nurse who works at the hospital where Evan is admitted, dismisses his claims of a supernatural app but subsequently downloads it, only for the app to claim that she has only two days left to live. Evan skips his surgery and is informed he has violated the user agreement. He tries escaping the hospital, but is confronted by an apparition of Courtney in a stairwell before being killed by the entity.
When Quinn finds out that Evan has died, she enters themorgueand checks his phone, which indicates no time left in the app. Concerned that she will die the next day, Quinn declines to go out with her family to visit her mother's grave. The app informs her that she has violated the user agreement. Shortly afterward, her boss Dr. Sullivansexually harassesher and thwarts her attempt to report his offense to hersupervisor. When Quinn researches the app, she finds that similar deaths have supposedly occurred involving other users, but the public generally considers them to be fake. She attempts to buy a new phone but finds that Countdown has downloaded itself onto it.
After being attacked by a demonic figure in the parking lot of the cell phone store, Quinn meets a young man named Matt, whose Countdown states he will die in 18 hours. They learn that the user agreement is broken if the user tries changing their fate: Quinn's trip with her family, and Matt taking a train ride, which they both canceled, should have resulted in their original deaths. At work, Quinn learns Sullivan has tricked the staff into thinking she sexually harassed him, resulting in her suspension. She and Matt consult a priest named Father John, who informs them that the app is linked to a demon named Ozhin, originally summoned by a Roma woman who told a prince when he would die. Cell phone salesman Derek hacks into the app code and identifies that Quinn's younger sister, Jordan, was meant to die shortly before Quinn, then adds several decades to Quinn, Jordan's, and Matt's lives. However, while Matt and Quinn spend the night together, the entity takes the form of Matt and attacks Quinn. To their shock, their countdowns, including Jordan's, reset to their original lifespans.
Jordan receives a notification of her countdown changing to the original lifespan and is then terrorized by a demonic form of her and Quinn's deceased mother. Quinn and Matt rescue her and return to Father John, who theorizes the curse can be broken if someone dies before their countdown ends or lives beyond their countdown. They prepare a warding circle in an attempt to delay Ozhin. The demon arrives and the circle initially wards off the demon, until it suddenly lures them outside, killing Matt and wounding Jordan in the process. While in grief over Matt's fate, Jordan starts having acute abdominal pain. Realizing her sister is seriously hurt, Quinn rushes Jordan to the hospital. Once there, she realizes she can kill Sullivan before his allotted time and break the curse. She attempts to attack him, but he is saved by Ozhin, who simultaneously prepares to kill Jordan. As Ozhin is terrorizing Jordan, Quinn overdoses on drugs before her timer ends and proves the app wrong. With instructions that Quinn gave her, Jordan revives her sister withNaloxoneand their countdown timers stop. Sometime later, while visiting her and Jordan's mother's grave, Quinn receives word of Sullivan's arrest after more nurses have come forward, but discovers that an app called Countdown 2.0 has downloaded itself onto her phone, much to the sisters' horror.
In amid credits, Derek is seen on aTinderdate. While his date goes to the restroom, his Countdown app causes the light to go out and Ozhin to attack him.

In the United States and Canada,Countdownwas released alongsideBlack and BlueandThe Current War, and was projected to gross around $5 million from 2,675 theaters in its opening weekend.[7]The film made $3.1 million on its first day, including $515,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to over-perform and debut at $9 million, finishing fifth.[4]In its second weekend the film fell 35% to $5.8 million, finishing seventh.[8]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 26% of 72 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.20/10. The website's consensus reads: "Countdownmay offer a few fleeting jolts for horror fans with barren queues, but it lacks enough wit or creativity to leave a lasting impression."[15]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[3]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed atPostTrakgave it 3 out of 5 stars.[4]
Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiangave the film 1 out of 5 stars, calling it "a Halloween release devoid of tricks, treats and anything even vaguely close to an original idea", and criticized it for its similarities to other horror films, especiallyFinal Destination.[5]Dennis Harvey ofVarietycalled it a "bombastically dumb new chiller that probably would have been called 'Killer App' if that title hadn't already been used several times."[6]The Verge'sCharles Bramesco wrote, "The same horror devotees satisfied by the prepackaged premise and grace in execution ofHappy Death Daywill get everything fromCountdownthat's there to be gotten. But those in search of more incisive techno-horror that cuts to the core of everything frightening about phone ownership and usage will have to continue waiting."[16]Zaki Hasan of theSan Francisco Chroniclegave it 1 out of 5 stars, writing, "The one thing you can say aboutCountdownis that the title is entirely accurate. Almost from the moment it starts, you're checking your watch waiting for the closing credits to come up."[17]
Kimber Myers of theLos Angeles Timeswas more positive, writing: "This isn't a subtle, moody film filled with a sense of unease; instead, jump scares are around every corner. If that's all you want from a horror movie, you'll have a very good time - and an elevated heart rate for its speedy 90 minutes."[18]TheDeseret News'Josh Terry wrote, "If you're looking for a few good scares that push the PG-13 boundary without breaking it,Countdownhas fun with its clever premise."[19]

STX Entertainmentis an American independent entertainment and media company. Founded in March 2014 by film producerRobert SimondsandTPG Growthmanaging partnerBill McGlashan, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects.

In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014 (the "S" standing for Simonds, the company's founder; the "T" standing forTPG Growth, whose managing partner McGlashan helped launch the company; and the "X" standing for "secret project"),[2]with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[3][4]Investors in the company includedHony Capital,Tencent,PCCW, TPG Growth,RTL GroupandLiberty Global. Individual investors includeGigi Pritzker,Beau Wrigley, andDominic Ng.[5][6][7]
