Lucy in the Skyis a 2019 Americanpsychological dramafilm directed byNoah Hawleyin his feature directorial debut, and co-written by Hawley, Brian C. Brown, and Elliott DiGuiseppi. The film starsNatalie Portmanas astronaut Lucy Cola, loosely based on the life of real-lifeNASAastronautLisa Nowak.[4]Alongside Portman, the cast includesJon Hamm,Zazie Beetz,Dan Stevens,Colman Domingo, andEllen Burstynin supporting roles.
The plot follows Lucy Cola as she returns to Earth after a transcendent experience in space, only to find herself losing touch with reality as her life unravels. Struggling to readjust to life on Earth, Lucy embarks on a dangerous emotional and psychological journey that tests her grip on sanity.
Lucy in the Skypremiered at the44th Toronto International Film Festivalon September 11, 2019, before its theatrical release in the United States on October 4, 2019, byFox Searchlight Pictures.[5][6]The film received negative reviews from critics, who criticized its pacing, writing, and lack of character development; however, praise was directed at Portman's performance. It emerged as acommercial disasterat the box-office, grossing $325,950 worldwide against a production budget of $21.4 million.
AstronautLucy Cola is profoundly affected by her first mission inspace, an experience that leaves her feeling disconnected from life on Earth. Upon returning, she struggles to reintegrate into her everyday routine with her supportive husband and niece. Although advised to undergo therapy and rest byNASA, Lucy becomes increasingly determined to return to space as soon as possible. She immerses herself in physical and mental training, pushing herself beyond limits in an effort to qualify for the next mission.
During her training, Lucy befriends Mark Goodwin, a fellow astronaut with whom she begins anextramarital affair, further distancing herself from her husband. She also meets Erin Eccles, a younger astronaut who recently set a new record, intensifying Lucy's competitive drive. As Lucy grows closer to Mark, she discovers that he is also romantically involved with Erin, which adds to her growing feelings of betrayal and isolation. When her grandmother dies of astroke, Lucy's emotional stability deteriorates further, and her increasingly erratic behavior begins to worry those around her, including her husband.
Despite her efforts, Lucy is informed by the NASA administration that she has been passed over for the upcoming space mission due to her erratic behavior, including a near-drowning incident during training and her failure to attend required therapy sessions. Instead of accepting the decision, Lucy becomes paranoid, suspecting ulterior motives, particularly when she finds that Erin has been selected for the mission. She becomes fixated on the idea that Mark, who had urged NASA to pass her over, is conspiring against her.
Lucy's psychological state deteriorates as she embarks on a cross-country road trip with her teenage niece, planning to confront Mark and Erin. During the journey, Lucy experiences hallucinations and leaves troubling messages for NASA. She ultimately tracks down Mark at an airport, where she confronts him, armed with a variety of weapons. Her attempt to seek revenge is thwarted when the police apprehend her, finding an array of disturbing items in her car.
Three years later, Lucy's life has taken a different path. She now works as a beekeeper, tending to hives with a sense of peace. Her niece, now in school, gives a class presentation, watched by Lucy's estranged husband. In a quiet, reflective moment, Lucy opens the hood of her protective suit and gazes at the bees and a butterfly, hinting at a fragile sense of acceptance and closure.

They didn't know what to do with that movie."[25]
