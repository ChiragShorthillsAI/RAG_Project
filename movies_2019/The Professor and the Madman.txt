The Professor and the Madmanis a 2019biographicaldramafilm directed byFarhad Safinia(under the pseudonym P. B. Shemran), from a screenplay by Safinia andTodd Komarnickibased on the 1998 bookThe Surgeon of Crowthorne(published in the United States asThe Professor and the Madman) bySimon Winchester. It starsMel Gibson,Sean Penn,Natalie Dormer,Eddie Marsan,Jennifer Ehle,Jeremy Irvine,David O'Hara,Ioan Gruffudd,Stephen Dillane, andSteve Coogan.
The film is about professorJames Murray, who in 1879 became director of anOxford University Pressproject,The New English Dictionary on Historical Principles(now known as theOxford English Dictionary) and the man who became his friend and colleague,W. C. Minor, a doctor who submitted more than 10,000 entries while he was confined atBroadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylumat Crowthorne after being foundnot guilty of murder due to insanity.
Shot inDublinin 2016, the film became part of a legal battle between Gibson and Safinia againstVoltage Pictures, delaying its release until 2019 and resulting in the pair disowning the final product.
In 1872London, retiredUnited States ArmysurgeonWilliam Chester Minorsuffers from hallucinations in which he sees himself being persecuted by a soldier he had to brand for desertion. During one of these visions, he mistakenly chases and kills innocent stranger George Merritt: for this crime, he is deemed insane and sent toBroadmoor. Meanwhile, ProfessorJames Murrayis admitted byOxford University Pressto the commission responsible for drafting what will be theOxford English Dictionary, an impressive dictionary capable of listing every term of the English language and explaining its etymology and variations of meaning, with literary citations to support. The work began twenty years earlier, but completing it is difficult given the amount of work and the speed with which the English language changes. Murray thus has the idea of launching an appeal to the English people: he asks anyone who wishes to send the commission a postcard bearing a word reference. This earns Murray the post of commission director.
In Broadmoor, Minor alternates between moments of madness and lucidity; in one such episode, he saves the life of a guard by amputating his leg in an exemplary manner. For this reason, asylum director Richard Brayne decides to experiment with new techniques of psychological support: he allows Minor to keep a small library and to be able to paint. Minor also asks to donate his army pension to Eliza, the widow of the man he killed, but she initially refuses due to the hatred she harbors for him. Minor learns of Murray's initiative and begins to send him several hundreds of entries, complete with quotes and examples.
Minor's contributions salvage the work of the commission and Murray, but progress is still judged to be too slow by the patrons. Murray goes to meet Minor and discovers his condition, and a strong friendship is immediately established between them. Murray decides to keep Minor's condition from his Oxford colleagues and his wife Ada. Meanwhile, Eliza desperately accepts Minor's offer and goes to Broadmoor to face her husband's killer. However, Eliza finds herself pitying him and begins to visit him often, bringing him books as gifts; Minor reciprocates by teaching her to read so that she can pass it on to her children and allow them to have a better future. Brayne decides to let this relationship evolve as part of the healing experiment.
The first volume of the Oxford Dictionary is released, but some colleagues of the commission contest Murray that the work is not precise and lacks many commonly used words. Behind this protest isHenry Bradley, who wishes to discredit Murray and take his position as project manager. Meanwhile, the relationship between Minor and Eliza becomes increasingly close: Eliza introduces Minor to her children, but her eldest daughter slaps him, aware that she is facing her father's murderer. Shortly after, Eliza kisses Minor, asking him what he would do if the feeling she feels is really love. Minor's psyche is destabilized, and he has hallucinations of Eliza's husband; in a crisis, he proclaims he has "killed" him twice and severs his penis. Brayne considers the experimental therapy a failure and revokes Minor's privileges, subjecting him to more violent methods.
A crisis is reached when a journalist commissioned by the Oxford Press to investigate Minor discovers the truth about him. However, moved with compassion, the journalist discusses the article with Murray, who thus comes to know what is going on. Bradley takes the opportunity as a pretext for Murray's ouster from the dictionary project, also ensuring that Minor's name is removed from the list of collaborators. Ada, initially shocked by the omissions, soon realizes how much she cares about her husband's friend and the dictionary, so she intercedes on his behalf before the commission. Murray arranges a meeting between Eliza and a catatonic Minor, who benefits from knowing that he has been forgiven and slowly improves. Murray, with the help of his patronFreddie Furnivall, manages to obtain a review of the trial in the hope of removing Minor from the asylum. Although Eliza intercedes on his behalf, the jury cannot withdraw the insanity diagnosis. Murray and Furnivall thus appeal tohome secretaryWinston Churchill. Hearing how passionately Murray defends Minor, Churchill decides to deport Minor to America as an unwanted alien. Minor and Murray say their final farewell before he leaves. Meanwhile, Furnivall obtains Murray's reinstatement as director of the commission for the Oxford Dictionary and the reinstatement of Minor's name among the collaborators in the drafting of the first volume.
Murray dies of pleurisy in 1915 after being knighted, while Minor dies of pneumonia in 1920. The Oxford English Dictionary is completed in 1928, 70 years after its conception, consisting of twelve volumes instead of the initially planned four and composed of more than 400,000 words accompanied by over a million citations.
French directorLuc Bessonhanded Mel Gibson the project, saying, "It isn't my first language. Maybe you can do something with this".[3]Gibson, who originally intended to direct, hired hisApocalyptoco-screenwriterFarhad Safiniato replace him, while he remained in the role ofJames Murray.Sean Pennentered early talks to join the film asWilliam Chester Minorin August 2016.[4]In August,Natalie Dormersigned on for a role.[5]In September,Ioan Gruffuddjoined the cast.[6]
Filming commenced inDublinin September 2016.[7][8]
In July 2017, Gibson and his production company Icon Productions sued the production company Voltage Pictures over their desire to control certain aspects of the production. Among other things, it was alleged that Voltage Pictures refused to schedule a "critical" five days of filming inOxfordand that the director was denied final cut privileges.[9][10]
On June 19, 2018, Judge Ruth Kwan of theLos Angeles County Superior Courtdenied Gibson's motion for summary adjudication.[11]The multiple lawsuits were the subject of a confidential settlement in April 2019. Gibson and Safinia issued statements distancing themselves from the project and calling the version released by Voltage "a bitter disappointment".[12]They did not participate in the promotion of the film. Safinia was not recognized for directing or co-writing the film, being credited instead under a pseudonym, "P. B. Shemran".[13]

Nick Allen ofRogerEbert.comgave the film one and a half out of four stars, calling it "the latest fiasco in bad movie history... the presence of Gibson and his co-star Sean Penn give the project a stuffy sanctimoniousness."[22]Likewise, Jay Weissberg, reviewing forVariety, was more critical and stated: "For those that have been anticipating this curious, much-delayed oddity, the good news is that Gibson is fine; it's everything else that doesn't work."[23]
In contrast, Tara McNamara, writing forCommon Sense Media, said that: "Despite the fact that both the star/producer and the director have disavowed it, this isn't a bad film; it's beautifully shot and sensationally acted, and it tells a fascinating real-life story."[24]

...You couldn't makeThe Tudorsnow, exploit the female body like that. When I took [that role], I was 24 and just grateful to be on set. I didn't know I could query things, say if I felt uncomfortable. Now, I have some profile and influence on a project."

We all got bodies, after all. In this film, the love-making scene is a metaphor for the way my character connects with the part played byEd Skrein. Nakedness is a good equaliser, and the shower scene also shows the tattoos on my character's body and makes it clear she is not quite who you think."[52][53]

The NSPCC tagline that 'Every Childhood is Worth Fighting For'; I believe that so strongly."[74]In 2024, she was made an honorary member of the NSPCC's council.[75]

The tour, named "Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge and other less successful characters", saw the return of some of his old characters including Paul Calf and Alan Partridge.[38]Reviews of the tour were mixed.[39][40][41]Much of the criticism focused on the apparent unrehearsed quality of some of the performances and on Coogan's nervous stage presence.Chortlecomedy guide described it as "most definitely a show of two halves: the superlative Alan Partridge plus a collection of characters that are not only less successful, but woefully less funny".[42]
As the tour progressed and the problems were ironed out, reviews were very positive. Dominic Maxwell ofThe Timesdescribed the show as "twice as entertaining as most other comedy shows this year".[43]Brian Logan ofThe Guardianawarded it four stars and described it as "shamelessly funny".[44]Reviews such as the one from theTrent FM Arenaexemplified how much the show had improved after dealing with the glitches on its first few dates: "When Steve Coogan first brought this show to Nottingham last month, the reviews were poor...  the intervening weeks have made a big difference, and last night's audience at the Trent FM Arena went home happy. More please, and soon."[45]
In 2008,BBC Worldwidebought a 25% stake in the production company. It did not offer the largest sum, but was chosen by Coogan and Normal owing to their previous work with and strong connection with theBBC.

The film received acclaim and was a financial success.

The film earned fourAcademy Awardnominations including forBest Picturelosing toSteve McQueen's historical drama12 Years a Slave(2013).[citation needed]Coogan's autobiography,Easily Distracted, was published in October 2015.[57][60]

Reilly, who playedOliver Hardy.[62]Todd McCarthy ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote that Coogan "slips neatly into the role" and added, "Coogan and Reilly not only excel at creating convincing impressions of one of the most famous comic teams of the last century, but they do an uncanny job of recreating a handful of their famous routines, which today mostly play as mild yet expertly timed delights."[63]For his performance, he earned a nomination for theBAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. In 2019, Partridge returned to the BBC withThis Time with Alan Partridge, a spoof of magazine shows such asThe One Show,[64]followed by anAudiblepodcast,From the Oasthouse, in 2020.[65]The podcast has now run for three seasons,[66]including a free teaser episode where Partridge commented on thecoronation of Charles III and Camilla.[67]

The tabloids[which?]also published intrusive information about his relationships and the schooling of his child. Coogan has also been critical of thebroadsheetpress, saying they have colluded with the tabloids in the interests of selling newspapers. In 2005, he said "The Guardiantends to have its cake and eat it. It waits for the tabloids to dish the dirt and then it talks about the tabloids dishing the dirt while enjoying it themselves."[83]He later gave credit to the same newspaper for its investigation of the phone hacking scandal.[84]He has said that the press, by persistently intruding in his private life, has effectively made him "immune" to further attack as his "closet is empty of skeletons".[85]

This information was obtained by Coogan's lawyers on 26 August 2011.[88]Interviewed onNewsnighton 8 July 2011, Coogan said he was "delighted" by the closure of theNews of the Worldand said it was a "fantastic day for journalism". He said the idea of press freedom was used by the tabloids as a "smokescreen for selling papers with tittle-tattle" and said the argument against press regulation was "morally bankrupt".[84]
Coogan provided an eight-page witness statement to theLeveson Inquiry, and appeared at the inquiry on 22 November 2011 to discuss the evidence.[81]He said he was there reluctantly representing a lot of celebrities who felt they could not speak out for fear of reprisals from the tabloid press.[89]
In March 2021, Coogan said "the tabloid press is controlled by a handful of tax shy billionaires with an agenda. Anyone who stands up to the press is attacked by them because they're bullies." He added "the fact thatMeghan MarkleandHarrywere attacked has nothing to do with jet-setting hypocrisy. It's because they broke the golden rule, which is to leave us alone and we'll go easy on you next time."[90]

He hosted a rally for Corbyn in Birmingham, saying: "The Tory tactic was to try to make this a choice betweenTheresa Mayand Jeremy Corbyn, but this has backfired as people – and I readily admit to being one of them – have started to listen to what Jeremy Corbyn says rather than what other people have been saying about him."[112]In November 2019, along with other public figures, Coogan signed a letter defending Corbyn, describing him as "a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergentfar-rightnationalism,xenophobiaand racism in much of the democratic world" and endorsed him in the2019 general election.[113]In December 2019, along with 42 other cultural figures, Coogan signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party in the election.
