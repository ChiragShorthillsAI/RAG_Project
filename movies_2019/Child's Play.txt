Serving both as aremakeof the1988 eponymous filmand arebootof theChild's Playfranchise, the film starsAubrey Plaza,Gabriel Bateman,Brian Tyree Henry, andMark Hamillas the voice ofChucky. It follows a family terrorized by a high-tech doll that malfunctions and becomes subsequently hostile and murderous.
Plans for aChild's Playremake began in the early 2010s, with original Chucky voice actorBrad Dourifset to reprise the role. However, it was turned down and the project entereddevelopment hell. By 2018,Metro-Goldwyn-Mayerannounced a remake with a different creative team than the original film series. Klevberg signed on as director from a script by Burton Smith, saying in an interview he drew inspiration from the 1982science fiction film,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.Principal photographyfor the film began in September 2018 and wrapped in November inVancouver,British Columbia.
Child's Playpremiered in Paris on June 18, 2019, before being theatrically released in the United States and Canada three days later byOrion PicturesthroughUnited Artists ReleasingandElevation Picturesrespectively. The film grossed $44.9 million worldwide against a $10 million budget and received mixed reviews from critics, with the Rotten Tomatoes' consensus calling it "predictably gruesome" and "generally entertaining".
Multinational Kaslan Corporation has just launchedBuddi, a revolutionary line ofhigh-tech dollsdesigned to be lifelong companions to their owners, learning from their surroundings, and acting accordingly viaartificial intelligence. It quickly becomes a worldwide success. At a Kaslan assembly factory inVietnam, an overworked employee is verbally abused and fired by his supervisor. In retaliation, he sabotages aBuddidoll by disabling all of its safety protocols before committing suicide.
InChicago, widowed retail clerk Karen Barclay and her twelve-year-old hearing-impaired sonAndyhave moved into a new apartment. In an attempt to cheer Andy up about the relocation and the presence of her new boyfriend Shane, Karen blackmails her boss to procure a defectiveBuddidoll; it is revealed to be the tampered one. Once activated, the doll names himself "Chucky" and becomes attached to Andy. Chucky helps him befriend two other children, Falyn and Pugg, but also begins to display violent tendencies.
Chucky kills the Barclays' pet cat after it scratches Andy and then terrorizes Shane, which leads him to rudely confront Andy. Misunderstanding Andy's pleas for Shane to disappear, Chucky follows him to his home, where it is revealed that Shane is married with children. Chucky breaks Shane's legs and activates acultivatorthat scalps and kills him. He delivers Shane's skinned face as a gift to a horrified Andy.
As police detective Mike Norris begins an investigation, Andy, Falyn, and Pugg disable Chucky and throw him into the garbage. Voyeur electrician Gabe finds and fixes the doll, who then kills him with atable saw. Meanwhile, Andy fails to convince Karen that the doll has become murderous. She takes him along to her job at the local shopping mall to keep an eye on him. When Chucky kills Norris' mother Doreen in a controlled car crash, Norris suspects that Andy is responsible for the murders and arrests him just as Chucky takes full control of the mall.
Chaos is unleashed as employees and customers are brutally killed by rampagingBuddidolls that Chucky has activated. Norris is wounded amid the massacre while Andy and his friends escape. However, Andy is forced to return when Chucky reveals that he is holding Karen hostage in the mall's storage. Andy saves his mother before Norris shoots Chucky down and Karen beheads him, both realizing Andy was telling the truth. As the police and paramedics tend to Karen, Norris, and other survivors outside the mall, Andy and his friends burn Chucky's body in a nearby alleyway.
In the aftermath of Chucky's killing spree, Kaslan CEO Henry Kaslan announces a massiveBuddidolls recall. As one of the dolls is placed into storage, his eyes flicker red and he smiles, revealing that Chucky transferred hisartificial intelligenceinto a new body.
In the early 2010s, beforeCurse of Chuckystarted its development, a planned remake for the original 1988Child's Playwas announced, withBrad Dourifset to reprise his role asChucky. There is not much information about the remake, but it was subsequently cancelled.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayerannounced the development of aChild's Playremake in July 2018, with a different creative team than theoriginal film series.[4]

We asked, thinking there was no way it would ever happen, and he said, 'Yes'. He was the first choice, a big swing, and it just happened... I mean, first of all, to have an icon reimagining an iconic character is an incredible gift, and to have an actor and a voice performer who is as celebrated as Mark Hamill, and as gifted as he is, I mean it's incredible. He's taking on this challenge with a huge amount of energy and really come at it in a very serious way. And it's really something to watch him create a character, and sort of embody it, and I get to sit there and watch Mark Hamill record. It's just incredible.[10]

Orion Releasing, LLC(doing business asOrion Pictures) is an Americanfilm productionanddistributioncompany owned by theAmazon MGM Studiossubsidiary ofAmazon.
It was founded in 1978 asOrion Pictures Corporation, ajoint venturebetweenWarner Bros.and three former senior executives atUnited Artists(UA). The company produced and released films from 1978 through 1999 and was also involved in television production and syndication in the 1980s and early 1990s. It was one of the largest mini-major studios during its early years, when it worked with prominent directors such asWoody Allen,James Cameron,Jonathan Demme, andOliver Stone.[3]Four films distributed by Orion wonAcademy AwardsforBest Picture:Amadeus(1984),Platoon(1986),Dances with Wolves(1990), andThe Silence of the Lambs(1991).[4]
In 1997, Orion was acquired byMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM), which revived the Orion name for television in 2013 and relaunched Orion Pictures a year later. In 2022, Amazon acquired Orion when it acquired MGM.
On February 6, 1978, three executives ofTransamerica(TA)-owned studioUnited Artists(UA)—Arthur B. Krim(chairman),Eric Pleskow(president and chief executive officer), andRobert Benjamin(chairman of the finance committee)—quit their jobs. Krim and Benjamin had headed UA since 1951 and subsequently turned around the then-flailing studio with a number of critical and commercial successes. Change had begun once Transamerica purchased UA in 1967 and, within a decade, a rift formed between Krim and Transamerica chairmanJohn R. Beckettconcerning the studio's operations. Krim suggested spinning off UA into a separate company which was rejected by Beckett.[5]
The last straw came for Pleskow when he refused to collect and deliver the medical records of UA department heads to Transamerica's offices in San Francisco for the sake of confidentiality. The tensions only worsened whenFortunemagazine reported an article on the clash between UA and TA in which Beckett had stated that, if the executives disliked the parent company's treatment of them, they should resign.[5]Krim, Benjamin and Pleskow quit UA on January 13, 1978, followed by the exits of senior vice presidents William Bernstein andMike Medavoythree days later. The week following the resignations, according to the websiteReference for Business, 63 important Hollywood figures took out an advertisement in a trade paper warning Transamerica that it had made a fatal mistake in letting the five men leave. The 'fatal mistake' came true following the box-office disaster ofHeaven's Gate[6]in 1980 which led to Transamerica selling UA toMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM).[7]
That same year, the five men forged a deal withWarner Bros.[8]The executives formed Orion Pictures Company, named afterthe constellationwhich they claimed had five main stars (it actually has seven or eight). The new company intended only to finance projects, giving the filmmakers complete creative autonomy; this ideal had been successfully implemented at United Artists. Orion held a $100 million line of credit and its films would be distributed by theWarner Bros.studio. Orion, however, was contractually given free rein over distribution and advertising as well as the number and type of films the executives chose to invest in.[9]
In late March 1978, Orion signed its first contract, a two-picture deal withJohn Travolta's production company. Contracts with actress and directorBarbra Streisand; actorsJames Caan,Jane Fonda,Peter Sellers,Jon Voight, andBurt Reynolds; directorsFrancis Ford CoppolaandBlake Edwards; writer/directorJohn Milius; singerPeter Frampton; and producerRay Starksoon materialized.[6][10]Orion also developed a co-financing and distribution deal withEMI Films.[6]In its first year, Orion had fifteen films in production and had a dozen more actors, directors and producers lining up to sign with them.[6]
In October 1979, Benjamin died.[11]Orion's first film,A Little Romance,[12]was released in April that year. Later that year, Orion releasedBlake Edwards'10which became a commercial success, the first for Edwards in over a decade (aside from installments ofThe Pink Pantherfranchise). Other films released by Orion over the next two years included a few successes such asCaddyshack(1980) andArthur(1981); critically praised but underperforming films such asThe Great Santini(1979), an adaptation of aPat Conroynovel, andSidney Lumet'sPrince of the City(1981); and pictures by young writer-directors such asPhilip Kaufman'sThe Wanderers(1979) andNicholas Meyer's debutTime After Time(1979); plusMonty Python's Life of Brian(1979) which Orion only distributed in the United States. Out of the 23 films Orion released between April 1979 and December 1981, only a third of them made a profit.[13]Orion executives were conflicted over financing big-budgeted films and passed onRaiders of the Lost Ark(1981) for that reason.[14]
By early 1982, Orion had severed its distribution ties with Warner Bros. As part of the deal, the rights to Orion's films made up to that point were sold to Warner Bros. Orion was now looking to have its own distribution network by acquiring another company with such capabilities. The four partners looked intoAllied ArtistsandEmbassy Pictures[15]before settling onFilmways.[16]Orion subsequently purchased Filmways and reorganized the flailing company. New employees were hired and all of Filmways' non-entertainment assets (Grosset & DunlapandBroadcast Electronics) were sold off.[6][16]
Another result of the merger was that Orion entered television production. Orion's biggest TV hit wasCagney & Lacey, which lasted seven seasons onCBS. In 1983, Orion Pictures introduced art-house divisionOrion Classicswith executives who had previously runUnited Artists Classics.[16][17]
Out of the initial 18 films released by the firm under the name of Orion Pictures Corporation, ten made profits, five just managed to cover their costs, and three suffered losses under $2 million.[6]One such film,Francis Ford Coppola'sThe Cotton Club, was mired in legal troubles and Orion lost $3 million of its investment.[6]"We've had some singles and doubles [but haven't] had any home runs," lamented Krim.[6]In September 1984, Orion distributedAmadeus, which garnered many accolades, winning eightAcademy Awards, includingBest Picture.[6]That year, on April 3, 1984, Orion Pictures launched Orion Entertainment Group, that would consist of four groups, Orion Television, Orion Home Video, Orion Pay Television and Orion Television Syndication, and the new organization would produce and distribute product for television, home video, pay and syndicated markets, withJamie Kellnerserving as president.[18]On October 26, 1984, the company released theJames Cameron-directedscience fiction filmThe Terminatorwhich was well received by critics and audience and led to a franchise involving five further films. However, Orion distributed none of the follow-ups.
For Orion, 1985 was a dismal year. All but two films,Desperately Seeking SusanandCode of Silence, made less than $10 million at the United States box office, including an unsuccessful attempt at aJames Bond-type franchise,Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins.[6]Orion's haphazard distribution channels and unsuccessful advertising campaigns made it impossible to achieve a hit. Another factor was that Orion was about to venture into the video business and stopped selling home-use rights to its films. Furthermore, the production of theRodney DangerfieldcomedyBack to Schoolwas put on hold when a co-producer died, taking the film off of its Christmas 1985 release slate.[19]
In January 1986,Mario KassarandAndrew Vajna, producers of theRambofilms (the first film,First Blood, was distributed by Orion) attempted to buy $55 million worth of the studio's stock through the duo's company,Anabasis. Had they succeeded, Kassar and Vajna would have controlled the board and laid off every executive save for Krim.[19]Warburg Pincus subsequently limited its 20% stake in Orion to 5%; the remaining stock was acquired byViacom International.[6]Viacom hoped to use Orion's product for its pay-TV channelShowtime.[20]Orion expanded into home video distribution with the formation of Orion Home Entertainment Corporation in 1985,[21]which began distributing videos under theOrion Home Videolabel in 1987 (before OHV's formation,HBO Videoand their predecessors, as well as former Orion's partnerWarner Home Video,Vestron VideoandEmbassy Home Entertainment, had been responsible for home media releases of Orion product).[6]
On May 22, 1986, a 6.5% stake in Orion was purchased byMetromedia, a television and communications company controlled by billionaire (and a friend of Krim's)John Kluge. Metromedia had just divested its television station group toRupert Murdoch'sNews Corporation(which would form what is now theFox network). Kluge's investment in Orion came at the right time;Back to Schoolwas a success that earned $90 million at the box office.[6]By March 1987, the studio's fortunes had increased dramatically with a succession of critical and commercial hits, includingPlatoon(which ultimately won a Best Picture Oscar), Woody Allen'sHannah and Her Sisters, and the sports filmHoosiers. Orion's 1986 offerings drew 18 Academy Award nominations, more than any other studio.[6]In 1987, Orion achieved further success withRoboCopandNo Way Out.[6]By this time, Orion's television division had expanded into the lucrative syndicated game show market under the name Century Towers Productions, a reference to Orion's street address. It produced revivals of format inherited fromHeatter-Quigley Productions, owned since the late 1960s by Filmways; this includedThe New Hollywood Squares, which ran from 1986 to 1989, and a revival ofHigh Rollersthat aired in the 1987–88 season. 1987 also saw the arrival of formerCBS/Fox Videoexecutive Len White, who became president and CEO of Orion Home Video, with plans to release its first home video titles in the third or fourth quarter of that year; he reported to Larry Hilford, who joined the home video division two years earlier.[22]
In January 1987, Kluge faced competition with the arrival ofSumner Redstone, whose theater chain,National Amusements, purchased 6.42 percent of Orion's stock. National Amusements later acquired Viacom, increasing their Orion stake to 21%, then 26%. Soon Kluge started buying more Orion stock, touching off a battle with Redstone over control of the company.[23][24]Kluge won on May 20, 1988, when Metromedia took over about 67% of Orion.[6]One analyst toldThe Wall Street Journal: "This amount is probably so small to Kluge it doesn't matter. He probably burns that up in a weekend."[6]
In 1989, Orion suffered from a disastrous slate of films, placing dead last among larger Hollywood studios by box office revenue. Among its biggest flops that year wereGreat Balls of Fire!, a biography ofJerry Lee LewisstarringDennis QuaidandWinona Ryder;She-Devil, a dark comedy starringMeryl StreepandRoseanne Barr;Speed Zone, an action-comedy vehicle forSCTValumniJohn Candy,Joe Flaherty, andEugene Levy; andMiloš Forman's adaptation ofLes Liaisons dangereuses,Valmont, which competed withDangerous Liaisons, also based on the same source material. Test screenings of the"Weird Al" YankoviccomedyUHFwere so strong that Orion had high expectations for it, but it flopped at the box office (though it later developed a cult following on video).[6][25]Also that year, it signed a deal withNelson Entertainmentto distribute titles on videocassette and theatrically.[26][27]
In February 1990, Orion signed a deal withColumbia Pictures Entertainmentin which the much larger studio would pay Orion $175 million to distribute Orion's movies and television programs overseas. Orion had previously licensed its films to individual distributors territory by territory.[6]That same month, Mike Medavoy left Orion and became head ofTri-Star Pictures.[28]
The box-office returns for Orion's 1990 releases were just as dismal, with failures inThe Hot SpotandState of Grace. The only bright spot wasKevin Costner's western epicDances with Wolves,which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture,[29]and grossed $400 million worldwide. A few months later, Orion garnered another winner withThe Silence of the Lambs, but these two films could not make up for years of losses. Only Kluge's continued infusions of cash were enough to keep the company afloat, but soon he had enough.
Kluge first attempted to sell Orion to businessman (and former20th Century Foxowner)Marvin Davis.Sony, which had recently purchasedColumbia Pictures, was also interested.[30]When those talks fell through, Kluge took drastic steps. First, Orion shut down production. Second, Kluge ordered the sale of several projects, such asThe Addams Family(which went toParamount, though the international rights to the film were retained by Orion), in order to accumulate much-needed cash. Finally, in the spring of 1991, Kluge's people took over the company, leading to the departure of Arthur Krim.[31]Orion's financial problems were so severe, that at the 63rd Annual Academy Awards in March 1991, hostBilly Crystalmade reference to Orion's debt in his opening monologue, joking that "Reversal of Fortune[is] about a woman in a coma,Awakenings[is] about a man in a coma; andDances with Wolves[was] released by Orion, a studio in a coma."[32]
It was during this time thatABCstepped in to co-finance and assume production over many of Orion TV's shows it had in production, such asAmerican DetectiveandEqual Justice. After Orion had to shut the television division down, this resulted in projects likeThe Chuck Woolery Show, which was planned to be produced by Orion, instead having to find new production companies (such asGroup W Productionsin the case of Woolery).[33]Gary Nardino, former employee of Orion Television Entertainment, moved on to producing forLorimar Television, taking some of Orion's projects with him, includingBill & Ted's Excellent AdventuresonFox, andHearts are Wild, a co-production withSpelling Television, forCBS; talent deals Orion Television had at the time (withThomas Carter,Robert Townsend, Paul Stajonovich, Clifton Campbell andDeborah Joy Levine) were also taken by Nardino to Lorimar.[34]On November 25, 1991, Orion sold itsHollywood Squaresformat rights toKing World Productionsafter Orion closed down its television division.[35]
On December 11, 1991, Orion filed forChapter 11 bankruptcyprotection.[6]That same month, Orion was in talks withNew Line Cinema, a successful independent film company, to acquire the bankrupt studio. By the following April, Orion and New Line Cinema cancelled their plans on the issue of price.Republic Picturesand the then-newSavoy Picturesalso attempted to buy Orion, but no deal materialized.[36][37]
In February 1992, Bernstein, who was president and chief executive of Orion at that point, resigned from the studio, Bernstein would go on to become executive vice president at Paramount Pictures.[38][39]
At the Academy Awards ceremony, broadcast on March 30, 1992, Crystal made another reference to Orion, this time about its demise:
Take a great studio like Orion: a few years ago Orion releasedPlatoon, it wins Best Picture.Amadeus, Best Picture. Last year, they releasedDances with Wolveswins Best Picture. This yearThe Silence of the Lambsis nominated for Best Picture. And they can't afford to have another hit! But there is good news and bad news. The good news is that Orion was just purchased, and the bad news is it was bought by the House of Representatives.[40]
The Silence of the Lambsswept all five major Academy Awards; however, a majority of key executives, as well as the talent they had deals with, had left the studio. Hollywood observers had doubts that Orion would be resurrected to its former glory.[41]
In May 1992, it was reported that Pleskow was resigning from Orion on July 1 of that year.[42]stating in the New York Times: "There is little for me to do at this point".[43]
On November 5, 1992, Orion reemerged from bankruptcy. Its reorganization plan would allow for Orion to continue producing and releasing films, but financing for the features would be provided by outside sources, with the studio purchasing the distribution rights to them after their completion.[44][45]
Orion's bankruptcy also delayed the release of many films the studio had produced or acquired, among them:Love Field(1992),RoboCop 3(1993),The Dark Half(1993),Blue Sky(1994),Car 54, Where Are You?(1994),Clifford(1994),The Favor(1994), andThere Goes My Baby(1994). Orion started releasing these films after their reorganization.Blue Skywon starJessica Langean Academy Award for Best Actress in 1995.
In August 1994, Orion Home Video partnered withStreamline Picturesin distributing the latter's licensedanimevideo titles to general retailers, which animation historianFred Pattenconsidered a major development in anime's growing popularity in Americanpop culture.[46]
In November 1995, Orion, two other companies controlled by Kluge, and film and TV houseMCEGSterling (producer of theLook Who's Talkingseries) were merged to form the Metromedia International Group.[47]Few of the films released during the four years afterbankruptcy protectionwere successful either critically or commercially.
In 1996, Metromedia acquired production companyMotion Picture Corporation of America, and installed its heads, Brad Krevoy and Steve Stabler, as co-presidents of Orion. Both received a six picture put picture distribution deal as a part of their contracts.[48]
In the years ahead, Orion produced very few films, and primarily released films from other producers, includingLIVE Entertainment.Orion Classics, minus its founders (who had moved toSony Pictures Entertainmentand foundedSony Pictures Classics), continued to acquire popularart-housefilms, such asBoxing Helena(1993), before Metromedia merged the subsidiary withSamuel Goldwyn Entertainmentin 1996.
In July 1997, Metromedia shareholders approved the sale of Orion Pictures (as well as Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment andMotion Picture Corporation of America) toMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM). This led to the withdrawal of 85 employees, including Krevoy and Stabler, while 111 other employees were to be laid off within nine months, leaving 25 of them to work at MGM. Orion Pictures also brought with it a two-thousand film library, ten completed movies and five direct-to-video features for future release[49]and the Krevoy and Stabler movie put picture distribution deal.[48]Krevoy and Stabler retained the right to the Motion Picture Corporation of America name and their three top movies. Metromedia retained Goldwyn Entertainment's Landmark Theatre Group.[49]One Man's Hero(1999) was the last film released by Orion Pictures for 15 years.
MGM kept Orion Pictures intact as a corporation, mostly to avoid its home video distribution agreement withWarner Home Videoand began distributing Orion Pictures films under the Orion Home Video label. MGM acquired the two thirds of the pre-1996PolyGram Filmed Entertainmentlibrary (which included theEpic film library) fromSeagramin 1999 for $250 million, increasing their library holdings to 4,000. The PolyGram libraries were purchased by its Orion Pictures subsidiary so as to avoid its 1990 home video distribution agreement with Warner Home Video.[50]In March 1999, MGM bought out its distribution contract with Warner Home Video for $225 million, effectively ending the distribution problem.[51]
In 2013, Orion returned to television production (after its original TV unit was shut down during its bankruptcy period) with a new syndicatedcourt show,Paternity Court.[52]
The Orion Pictures name, also as Orion Releasing, was extended in fourth quarter 2014 for smaller multi-platform video on demand and limited theatrical distribution. Its name was first seen again on September 10, 2014, in front of the trailer forThe Town That Dreaded Sundownthat was released in October. The label's first release was the Brazilian filmVestido pra Casar.[53]
In September 2015,Entertainment One Filmsrelaunched theMomentum Picturesbanner with an announced deal with Orion Pictures to co-acquire and co-distribute films in the United States and Canada, and selected foreign markets, such as theUnited Kingdom(Momentum's country of origin). The initial films under the deal wereThe Wannabe,Fort TildenandBalls Out.[54]Other films released by Orion Pictures andMomentum PicturesincludePocket ListingandDiablo.[55][56][57]
Starting in September 2016 withBurn Country, Orion Pictures andSamuel Goldwyn Filmspaired in acquiring several films.[58][59][60][61]
Orion Television launched a second court show in the fall of 2017,Couples Court With The Cutlers, which features married couple Keith and Dana Cutler presiding over romantic and domestic disputes.[62]
On September 6, 2017, MGM officially revitalized the Orion Pictures brand as a standalone, US theatrical marketing and distribution arm with the hiring of John Hegeman, who joined fromBlumhouse Tilt(distributor of Orion'sThe Town That Dreaded SundownandThe Belko Experiment) and incidentally got his start at the original Orion in the 1980s. Hegeman would serve as president of the expanded label and report toJonathan Glickman, president of MGM's motion picture group. Under his leadership, the "new" Orion will produce, market and distribute four to six modestly budgeted films a year across genres and platforms, and both wide and limited releases for targeted audiences. Its first release, the young adult romance dramaEvery Day, was released on February 23, 2018.[4][63][64][65]

Worldwide Gross
Almost all of Orion's post-1982 releases, as well as most of the AIP and Filmways backlogs and all of the television output originally produced and distributed by Orion Television, now bear the MGM name. However, in most cases, the 1980s Orion logo has been retained or added, in the case of the Filmways and AIP libraries.
Most ancillary rights to Orion's back catalog from the 1978–1982 joint venture period remain with Warner Bros., including such films as10(1979),Caddyshack(1980),Arthur(1981),Excalibur(1981), andPrince of the City(1981). Some post-1982 films originally released by Orion—Lionheart(1987),The Unbearable Lightness of Being(1988), andAmadeus(1984) (the latter two beingSaul Zaentzproductions)—are currently distributed by Warner Bros. as well.HBOalso owns video distribution rights toThree Amigos(1986), as they co-produced the film and owns pay-TV rights. However, MGM owns all other rights and the film's copyright.[citation needed]The Wanderersis owned by the film's producers; however, the copyright is held by MGM/Orion. Orion also retains a controlling interest inThe Cotton Club, although major rights are now withLionsgate, which owns the library of presenting studioZoetrope Corporation.
Woody Allen's filmsA Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy(1982) andZelig(1983) are the only Orion films from the original joint venture period now owned by MGM, as the rights for them remained with Allen, who sold them to MGM in 2000.[79]Orion releases produced by theHemdale Film CorporationandNelson Entertainmentare included in MGM's library as well, and are incorporated into the Orion library. MGM did not acquire the Hemdale films (which includeThe Terminator,Hoosiers, andPlatoon) or the Nelson films (including theBill & Tedfilms) until MGM bought the pre-1996 library of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment (the "Epic library"), which included both companies' libraries, although the television and digital rights to certain Nelson films are now held byParamount Television(the result of a pre-existing deal Nelson had with Viacom), with television syndication handled on behalf of Paramount Television byTrifecta Entertainment & Media.
Many of the film and television holdings ofThe Samuel Goldwyn Companyhave now also been incorporated into the Orion library (with ownership currently held by MGM), and the copyright on some of this material is held by Orion, exceptThe New Adventures of Flippernow carries the MGM Television Entertainment copyright.[citation needed]
MGM still holds distribution rights to the 1980s revival ofHollywood SquaresandHigh Rollersthe company produced, as well as the remnants of the Heatter-Quigley library that was not erased, including all remaining episodes of the originalSquares; they do not own the rights to the format, which is currently owned byCBS Television Distribution, successor-in-interest to King World, who purchased the format rights in 1991 and produced another syndicated revival from 1998 to 2004.
Orion distributed the firstRambo film,First Blood(1982).[80]That film, like the rest of theRambofranchise, is now owned byStudioCanalas a result of purchasing the library of its co-distributor,Carolco Pictures.[81]
