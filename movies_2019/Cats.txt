Catsis a 2019musicalfantasy filmbased on the 1981West EndmusicalCatsbyAndrew Lloyd Webber, which in turn was based on the 1939 poetry collectionOld Possum's Book of Practical CatsbyT. S. Eliotwhich the film is also based on/inspired by. The film was directed byTom Hooper, in his second feature musical followingLes Misérables(2012), from a screenplay byLee Halland Hooper. It starsJames Corden,Judi Dench,Jason Derulo,Idris Elba,Jennifer Hudson,Ian McKellen,Taylor Swift,Rebel WilsonandFrancesca Hayward. The film marked the feature film debut for both Derulo and Hayward.
Filming took place from December 2018 to April 2019. It was theatrically released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 20 December 2019 byUniversal Pictures.Catsgrossed $75.5 million worldwide on a budget of $80–100 million, resulting in an estimated loss of $71 million after ancillary costs,[6]and was considered abox office bombat the time. The film received negative reviews from critics and is considered to be one of theworst films in history.
Victoria, a young white cat, is abandoned by her owner in the streets ofLondonin the middle of the night. Witnessing this, a group of alley cats introduce themselves to her as the "Jellicles".Mr. Mistoffelees,Munkustrap, Cassandra, and Demeter take Victoria under their wing and show her the world of the Jellicles as they prepare for the JellicleBall, an annual ceremony where cats must compete to be chosen to go to the Heaviside Layer andbe granted a new life.
Most of the Jellicle Ball competitors are introduced and sing about themselves:Jennyanydots, a domestic tabby who sleeps during the day and by night boosts the productivity of mice and roaches; theRum Tum Tugger, an extravagant yet indecisive cat who riles up the others;Bustopher Jones, abourgeoiscat who boasts about his weight and shares food scraps from the garbage;Skimbleshanks, a tidy ginger cat whotap dancesand supervises the operation of atrain; andGus, an aged theatrical cat who has played some of the biggest roles in history.
Victoria also happens to meet the mischievous twins,Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer, who enjoy causing trouble and messing with things in the house of their human family. They convince Victoria to join in the fun, but leave her tangled up in some necklaces when the family dog is alerted to their presence. Luckily, Mr. Mistoffelees comes to rescue Victoria, distracting the dog and escaping with her. They return to the group just in time for the arrival of the tribe's wise and belovedmatriarch,Old Deuteronomy. The Jellicle Ball commences inside the abandoned Egyptian Theatre. Victoria dances a ballet solo in the moonlight but is distracted by Cassandra harassingGrizabella, a former glamour cat who was banished from the tribe for, among other things, her past allegiance withMacavity, a notorious criminal and con artist capable ofteleportation. Victoria relates to Grizabella's feelings of abandonment. As Grizabella slinks away into the streets, Old Deuteronomy witnesses their quiet camaraderie and assures Victoria that she can become a Jellicle herself in time.
A seductivefemme fatalenamedBombalurinainterrupts the ball, distracting the Jellicles present with a song and dance number praising Macavity and simultaneously incapacitating them withcatnip. When Macavity arrives and demands to be made the Jellicle Choice, Old Deuteronomy deems him unworthy and is subsequently kidnapped and placed with most of the other contestants that he has kidnapped. As the Jellicles recuperate, distraught over their leader's disappearance, Victoria suggests that Mr. Mistoffelees use his powers to conjure Old Deuteronomy back. He tries several times, eventually making Old Deuteronomy reappear. The cats rejoice and praise Mr. Mistoffelees, and he and Victoria dance together. Meanwhile, a thwarted Macavity and Bombalurina teleport away from his victims, who begin to free themselves via Jennyanydots' costume change. Macavity leaves his lackey,Growltiger, to walk the plank defenseless against the emancipated cats.
Grizabella returns to the Egyptian Theatre. Victoria vouches for her and urges her to sing her true feelings. Grizabella sings a passionate ballad about her mistakes, her former glory, and her beauty, sentiments that touch the hearts of the Jellicles. Old Deuteronomy names Grizabella the Jellicle Choice and sends her off to the Heaviside Layer in a chandelier (repaired by Mr. Mistoffelees' magic to float like ahot air balloon). Macavity, in one last attempt to reach the Heaviside Layer, leaps onto a rope from the chandelier, but falls ontoNelson's Column. The Jellicles, reunited with their kidnapped brethren, and perched on a lion statue, watch Grizabella ascend as the morning sun appears above the horizon. After the congregation disperses, Old Deuteronomy welcomes Victoria to the tribe.
An animated film adaptation based on the musical was initially planned byAmblimationin the 1990s but was abandoned with the studio's closure.[28]In December 2013,Andrew Lloyd Webber, creator and composer of the musical stage productionCats, teased thatUniversal Pictures, which had purchased the film rights toCatsmany years earlier, was putting the project into active development.[29]
In February 2016, it was reported thatTom Hooperwas in negotiations to direct the film, and was considering actresses, includingSuki Waterhouse, to star.[30]In May 2016, Hooper was confirmed as director.[31]
In January 2018, Hooper andWorking Titlebegan officially casting for the film, while looking into the technical aspect of whether the film would be entirely live-action orcomputer generated, with Lloyd Webber announcing he would be writing a new song for the film adaptation.[32]On 24 October 2019, it was announced that the new song was titled "Beautiful Ghosts", written by Lloyd Webber and Taylor Swift.[33]The song was sung by Francesca Hayward, followed later in a reprise by Judi Dench, with a credits version sung by Swift.[34]The version sung by Swift was released on 15 November 2019.[35]
In June 2018, there were reports thatAnne Hathawaywas considered for a role in the film, but she declined due to a scheduling conflict.[36]Hugh Jackmanwas also offered a role by Hooper but turned it down.[37]In July 2018,Jennifer Hudson,Taylor Swift,James Corden, andIan McKellenjoined the cast.[38]Swift had previously tested for the role ofÉponinein Tom Hooper'sLes Misérablesbut was given the part of Bombalurina without an audition.[39]
In September 2018,Laurie Davidsonand Mette Towley were cast, withSteven Spielbergannounced to be executive producing.[40][41]In October 2018,Idris ElbaandJudi Denchjoined the cast of the film.[42][43]Dench was cast in the original stage musical, but had been forced to pull out due to atorn Achilles tendon; Lloyd Webber and Hooper made Old Deuteronomy a female cat and offered her the role.[44]
In November 2018, ballet dancersFrancesca HaywardandSteven McRae, andRebel Wilson,Jason DeruloandRobert Fairchildjoined the cast of the film, with rehearsals commencing atLeavesden StudiosinHertfordshire, England.[45][46][47][48]Andy Blankenbuehlerchoreographed the film, afterWayne McGregorwas forced to back out due to scheduling conflicts.[49]Blankenbuehler also choreographed the stage musical's 2016 Broadway revival. In December 2018,Les TwinsandEric Underwoodjoined the cast.[50]
Principal photographybegan on 12 December 2018[50]and wrapped on 2 April 2019.[51]Swift said that the cast attended "cat school", in which "We would literally do hours on end of barefoot crawling on the floor, hissing at each other. We learned about cat instincts and the way they carry themselves and the way that they process information, the way they see the world, the way they move."[52]
Music for the film was composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber with contributions from producerGreg Wells, who was initially brought in after production in mid-2019.[53]The recordings were created partly at Abbey Road Studios with contributions from the London Symphony Orchestra.[53]Wells also played a number of instruments on the music himself, including the drums, pipe organ, bass guitar and Abbey Road's fabledMrs Millspiano, used inBeatlessongs such as "Penny Lane" and "With a Little Help from My Friends".[53]
A "highlights" edition of the soundtrack with a running time of 59 minutes was released on 20 December 2019 byPolydor Recordsand in the US byRepublic Records.[54]The song "Beautiful Ghosts" byTaylor Swift, a single from the soundtrack album, was released on 15 November 2019.[55]
Less than two months before the film was scheduled to be released in theatres, production was still ongoing for its music.[53]

Catsuses extensivevisual effects(VFX) throughout to convert the live-action actors intoanthropomorphiccats viacomputer-generated imagery(CGI). However, the production originally intended to use makeup and costumes with fur for the characters. Hooper experimented with usingprostheticsto create the look of the cats due to the then-prohibitive costs of VFX, but he was dissatisfied, feeling that "[Y]ou ended up with full-faced prosthetics where you lost so much emotion. [...] So all the paths seemed to lead me back to visual effects."[56]When production moved to digital options, companies likeTechnicolor SAsubsidiariesMill FilmandMPCjoined in for the visual effects.[57]To aid this, the actors performed inmotion capturesuits with tracking dots on their costumes and faces.[58]The bodies of the cat characters were rendered using CGI withdigital furblended with the actors' actual faces.[59]
In an interview withThe Daily Beast, a VFX editor who worked on the movie confirmed that an early, half-finished iteration ofCatsfeatured visible anuses. Another crew member is quoted as saying that the appearance was not intentional. Rather, it was the result of the film's "unique visual effects". Ultimately, one crew member was assigned the task of editing out anything that appeared to be an anus.[60]
Substantial work on the VFX forCatswas performed at Mill Film Montreal and Adelaide.The Daily Beastreported a troubled production; sources within one VFX studio said that staff had to work 80–90 hour weeks to finish the effects by the release date, and Hooper would send denigrating emails to individual VFX artists about their work and insult them during conferences.[61]The VFX process was reportedly hindered by Hooper's rejection of the usual CGI workflow: rather than viewing partially-rendered "playblasts" of scenes to check movement before fine details such as lighting and fur were added, he demanded costly and time-consuming full renders before reviewing scenes, and told crews that real-life references of cats must be used for every movement, which someone had to point out was impossible because "cats don't dance."[61]The team spent six months producing the film's two-minute trailer, leaving just four months to finish the entire 110-minute film. The film's visuals were completed just hours before its premiere.[59][61][62][63]
At the92nd Academy Awards, Corden and Wilson appeared in character as Bustopher Jones and Jennyanydots, mocking the film's CGI while presentingBest Visual Effects. This led to criticism from the production's VFX animators, many of whom werelaid offwhen Mill Film Montreal and MPC Vancouver closed following the film's production, as well as condemnation by theVisual Effects Society, an organisation representing the VFX industry.[61][64][65][66]The film's visual effects were also mocked in the 2022DisneyfilmChip 'n' Dale: Rescue Rangers, in a scene where the titular characters notice two alley cats resembling the ones in the film as they venture through an "uncanny valley" part of town.[67]
The film premiered atAlice Tully Hallat theLincoln Centerin New York City on 16 December 2019[68][69]and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom and United States on 20 December 2019.[70]
On 6 April 2019, Hudson performed "Memory" at the Las Vegas CinemaCon, along with a behind-the-scenes look with the film's cast and crew.[71]On 17 July 2019, Universal released a behind-the-scenes featurette detailing the various aspects of production and featuring interviews with the cast and crew.[72]
The first trailer was released on 18 July 2019,[73]and received overwhelmingly negative reactions from viewers.[74]Many viewers were unsettled by the mix of CGI and live-action used to portray the cats, and cited the effects as an example of theuncanny valley, with some comparing it unfavourably to the design ofSonicin the first trailer of the then-upcoming filmSonic the Hedgehog, which sparked similar criticism that ultimately resulted in the character being redesigned and the film being delayed.[75][76]The studio spent about $115 million on global promotions and advertisements.[77]
Catswas releasedonlineon 17 March 2020, and onBlu-rayandDVDon 7 April in the United States. The film was released on 29 April 2020 in Australia and on 1 June 2020 in the United Kingdom.
The film's original release contained numerous CGI errors and glitches, such as one scene in which Judi Dench's human hand, complete with her wedding ring, appears instead of Old Deuteronomy's cat paw.[78]After poor reviews, Universal notified cinemas on opening day that an updatedDigital Cinema Packagewith "some improved visual effects" would be available for download on 22 December, urging them to replace the current print as soon as possible. Studio executives and cinema owners said that the decision to release a modified version of a film already in wide release was "unheard of".[79]
Catsgrossed $27.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $47.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $74.6 million against a production budget of about $95 million.[5][4]Deadline Hollywoodcalculated thenet lossof the film to be $113.6million.[80]
In the United States and Canada,Catswas initially projected to gross $15–20 million in its opening weekend.[81]Universal hoped that the film wouldappeal to young womenascounterprogrammingagainstStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and emphasised Swift in marketing.[62]After making $2.6 million on its opening day (including $550,000 from Thursday night previews), estimates forCatswere lowered to $7 million.[3]Ultimately, the film only debuted to $6.5 million, finishing fourth at the box office. The poor performance was attributed to negative reception of the trailers, poor reviews and competition fromThe Rise of Skywalker.[2]
In its second weekend,Catsmade $4.8 million (for a total of $8.7 million over the five-day Christmas period), finishing in eighth place.[82]It then made $2.6 million in its third weekend, finishing tenth.[83]
Thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoesreported that 19% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 334 reviews, with anaverage ratingof 3.9/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "Despite its fur-midable cast, thisCatsadaptation is a clawful mistake that will leave most viewers begging to be put out of their mew-sery."[84]On review aggregatorMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 32 out of 100 based on 51 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[85]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an average 0.5 out of 5 stars, with 30% saying they would definitely recommend it.[77]
Peter Debruge ofVarietycalled the film "one of those once-in-a-blue-moon embarrassments that mars the résumés of great actors (poor Idris Elba, already scarred enough as the villainous Macavity) and trips up the careers of promising newcomers (like ballerina Francesca Hayward, whose wide-eyed, mouth-agape Victoria displays one expression for the entire movie)." He criticized the direction and effects, and particularly predicted that the film would appeal to thefurry fandom,[86]though many in the furry fandom also found the effects disturbing.[87]
David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterfelt that the film was "hobbled by a major misjudgment in its central visual concept", lamenting its execution (such as the poor proportions of the "cats" to their environments) and deeming the film "exhausting".[88]Peter TraversofRolling Stonerated the film zero stars out of five, stating it was "bizarre", had terrible special effects, and made the audience "want to cry for mercy", while Hooper "traps the actors in an airless, lifeless bubble of a film that scarcely gives them room to breathe, much less develop a character".[89]
In theLos Angeles Times,Justin Changwrote: "With its grotesque design choices and busy, metronomic editing,Catsis as uneasy on the eyes as a Hollywood spectacle can be, tumbling into anuncanny valleybetween mangy realism and dystopian artifice."[90]Debruge said that the film should have used "face paint and Lycra" like the musical.[86]
Simran Hans ofThe Observeragreed that "many of its uncanny images are sure to haunt viewers for generations". Her one-star review described the film as "a clear career low" for most of the actors, wondering whether they "are aware of what they've gotten themselves into".[63]Peter BradshawforThe Guardianagreed with the one-star rating. In a review parodying "The Naming of Cats", he criticised the visual style and particularly the character design, while lambasting the film as a "dreadful hairball of woe".[91]
Manohla DargisofThe New York Timesfelt that Hooper had made "a robust effort" to adapt the stage musical—which "was always going to be difficult, particularly once the decision was made to create a live-action version rather than an animated one"—and "enlisted some talented performers", but that the film version suffered from a lack of the human connection that theatre involves, where performers and audience share a space, without which "all that's left are canned images of fit-looking people meowing and raising their rumps high in the air".[92]
The Hollywood ReporternamedCatsone of the ten worst films of 2019,[93]Travers said it "easily scores as the bottom of the 2019 barrel—and arguably of the decade",[89]and Adam Graham ofThe Detroit Newssaid "Catsis the biggest disaster of the decade, and possibly thus far in the millennium. It'sBattlefield Earthwith whiskers."[94]Alex Cranz ofio9warned: "I have seen sights no human should see" but said others "must witness" Hooper's, the actors', and Hollywood's hubris, citing a human being appearing in a group of cats, a cat-coloured woman without fur, and other examples of how "the shit's justnot finished."[95]Ty BurrofThe Boston Globe's half-star review said "there are moments inCatsI would gladly pay to unsee" and warned small children to not watch the film. He reported that the preview audience laughed like the reaction toSpringtime for Hitlerduring Dench's "The Ad-dressing of Cats", because each pause in her lyrics seemed to be the end of the film ("at long last") before continuing.[96]Patrick Gibbs ofSLUGsaid: "There is not enough kitty litter in the world to cover up this mess."[97]
Pete Hammond ofDeadlinecomplimented Taylor Swift's performance as Bombalurina and her signature "Macavity" number, as well as "Beautiful Ghosts", which she wrote along with Lloyd Webber.[98]Patrick Ryan ofUSA Todaystated that Swift "makes the most of her brief screen time, bringing her unabating charisma to the flirtatious feline ... if there's one thing that's disappointing about Swift's performance, it's that there isn't more of it".[99]Hans said that she was the only actor "who seems to be having fun, perhaps because she only appears in the film for approximately 10 minutes."[63]Jennifer Hudson similarly received praise for her rendition of "Memory", with some critics describing it as "the best part" of the film[100]and "the sole musical number in the new movie that summons real feeling".[101]
Lloyd Webber was critical of the film, calling it "ridiculous" in an interview withThe Sunday Times, saying: "The problem with the film was that Tom Hooper decided that he didn't want anybody involved in it who was involved in the original show."[102]He later revealed in an interview withThe Daily Telegraph: "I wrote to the head of Universal and said, 'You've got a car crash on your hands unless you get a grip on this thing', a year before they made (it). I didn't even get a reply."[103]In a 2021 interview withVariety, Lloyd Webber claimed his negative reaction to the film had even directly inspired him to adopt aHavanese dog.[104]
Simon Wells, who was previously set to direct the animated film adaptation for Amblimation, said that the live action version had "a lot of things about it that are not good."[105]
On 26 December 2019, it was reported that Universal had removedCatsfrom itsFor Your Considerationweb page. The film was not available on theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' privatestreaming mediaplatform for award contenders.[106][107]

Lee Hall(born 20 September 1966) is an English writer and lyricist. He is best known for writing the screenplay for the filmBilly Elliot(2000) and the book and lyrics for its adaptation asa stage musicalof the same name. In addition, he wrote the playThe Pitmen Painters(2007), and the screenplays for the filmsWar HorseandRocketman(2019).
Hall was born in 1966 inNewcastle upon Tyne, the son of ahouse painter and decoratorand a housewife. He was educated atBenfield SchoolinWalkergate. As a youth he went to Wallsend Young People's Theatre along with Deka Walmsley, Mark Scott 
and Trevor Fox. Walmsley later appeared in two of Hall’s works,Billy ElliotandThe Pitmen Painters.
Hall attendedFitzwilliam College,Cambridge, where he studied English literature and was taught by poetPaul Muldoon.[1]
After leaving Cambridge, he first worked as a youth theatre fundraiser in Newcastle and at theGate Theatrein London. In 1997, his playwriting career was launched with the broadcast of his radio play,Spoonface Steinberg, onBBC Radio 4.[2]
Hall's most commercially successful work isBilly Elliot, the story of aNorth Eastern Englishboy who, in the face of opposition from his family and community, aspires to be a ballet dancer. The inspiration for the screenplay was drawn, in part, from theA. J. CroninnovelThe Stars Look Down, which is also set in an English coal mining community during astrike, and similarly tells the story of a miner's son who goes against the grain.[3]The character Billy was also partly inspired by the renownedbaritoneSir Thomas Allenwho came from a similar background, having been born in the North East'sCounty Durham.[4]Initially a 2000 film directed byStephen Daldry, for which Hall wrote the screenplay, and for which he received anAcademy Awardnomination,Billy Elliotwas later turned intoa stage musical, with music byElton Johnand lyrics by Hall. It enjoyed a long run in the West End and opened on Broadway in 2008. It won Hall the 2009Tony AwardforBest Book of a Musical.
Also successful wasSpoonface Steinberg, the tale of a young autistic Jewish girl who is dying of cancer. The last in a quartet ofradio playsentitledGod's Country, the monologue aroused an unprecedented listener response when it was broadcast in 1997 onBBC Radio. It was subsequently voted one of the ten best radio dramas of all time by readers of the magazineRadio Times.Spoonface Steinbergwas adapted as a television play and into aone woman showstarring 42-year-old actressKathryn Hunter. The play opened in 1999 and later transferred to the West End.
Hall had more limited success with his comedyCooking with Elvis, the protagonist of which is anElvis Presley impersonatorwho has been paralyzed in a car crash. It was originally a 1995 radio play but it became a stage play in 1999. Hall's fondness for moving from one medium to another can also be seen in his workI Luv You Jimmy Spud, which began as a 1995 radio play and was later adapted by Hall into a stage play and a film,Gabriel and Me, starringBilly ConnollyandIain Glen.
He has also translated plays byCarlo Goldoni,Bertolt BrechtandHerman Heijermansand co-written the screenplays for adaptations ofJane Austen'sPride & PrejudiceandKenneth Grahame'sThe Wind in the Willows.
Hall's play,The Pitmen Painters, inspired by art criticWilliam Feaver's book on theAshington Group, premiered at the refurbishedLive TheatreinNewcastle upon Tynein 2007. It tells of a group of miners fromAshington,Northumberland, who decide to learn about art and begin to paint. The production later transferred to theNational Theatrein London and opened on Broadway in September 2010. It won the 2008Evening Standard Award for Best Play.
In 2011, controversy arose over a children's opera that Hall had written, calledBeached. The opera was commissioned byOpera Northand was to have been performed by children from Bay Primary School inBridlington,East Riding of Yorkshire. The story is about a gay retired painter, a single father who tries to spend a quiet day at the seaside with his son, but who is interrupted by children on a school trip, dogs, a landscape painter, an amateur dramatic society and others. After rehearsals had been going on for six months, the school threatened to pull the children out of the production if changes were not made to the libretto. Hall changed some words to accommodate their requests, but school officials, supported by Opera North, insisted on the removal of the words "I'm queer" and "I prefer a lad to a lass," and other references to the character being gay.[5]The school eventually agreed to let the children perform if Hall changed "queer" to "gay."[6]
Hall was the original writer on the screenplay for a film adaptation ofMichael Morpurgo'sWar Horse; he shares credit on the finished film withRichard Curtis, who was brought in bySteven Spielberg.[7]His most recent TV work is an adaptation ofNigel Slater's AutobiographyToast, starringHelena Bonham CarterandFreddie Highmoreand set inWolverhampton, West Midlands. First broadcast onBBC Onein December 2010,Toastreceived a gala at the 2011Berlin Film Festivaland was released in cinemas on 11 August 2011. He also worked on the screenplay for the yet-to-releaseWorking TitlefilmHippie Hippie Shake, based onRichard Neville's memoirHippie Hippie Shake: The Dreams, the Trips, the Trials, the Love-ins, the Screw Ups: The Sixties.
Hall's other projects include abiopicofElton John,Rocketman,[8]released in May 2019, a stage musical adaptation ofPink Floyd'sThe Wall,[9]and a film adaptation ofGeorge Orwell's 1933 memoirDown and Out in Paris and London.[10]
Hall married film directorBeeban Kidron(Baroness Kidron) in 2003.[11]Kidron is a child rights advocate who has played a determinative role in establishing standards for online safety and privacy across the world.[12]

Through her parents, Dench had regular contact with the theatre: her father was theGPforYork Theatre Royal, and her mother was its wardrobe mistress.[16]Actors often stayed in the Dench household. During these years, Judi Dench was involved on a non-professional basis in the first three productions of the modern revival of theYork Mystery Playsin 1951, 1954 and 1957.[17]In the third production she played the role of theVirgin Mary, performed on a fixed stage in theMuseum Gardens.[18]

Dench made her first professional stage appearance in September 1957 with theOld VicCompany at theRoyal Court TheatreinLiverpool, asOpheliainHamlet. According to the reviewer forLondon Evening Standard, Dench had "talent which will be shown to better advantage when she acquires some technique to go with it."[20]Dench then made her London debut in the same production at the Old Vic. She remained a member of the company for four seasons, 1957–1961, her roles including Katherine inHenry Vin 1958 (which was also her New York City debut) and Juliet inRomeo and Julietin 1960, both directed and designed byFranco Zeffirelli. During this period, Dench toured the United States and Canada and appeared inYugoslaviaand at theEdinburgh Festival.[21]She joined theRoyal Shakespeare Companyin December 1961, playing Anya inThe Cherry Orchardat theAldwych Theatrein London and made herStratford-upon-Avondebut in April 1962 as Isabella inMeasure for Measure.

In 1968, she was offered the role of Sally Bowles in the musicalCabaret. AsSheridan Morleylater reported: "At first she thought they were joking. She had never done a musical and she has an unusual croaky voice which sounds as if she has a permanent cold. So frightened was she of singing in public that she auditioned from the wings, leaving the pianists alone on stage".[26]But when it opened at thePalace Theatrein February 1968,Frank Marcus, reviewing forPlays and Players, commented that: "She sings well. The title song, in particular, is projected with great feeling."
After a long run inCabaret, Dench rejoined theRSC, making numerous appearances with the company in Stratford and London for nearly twenty years, winning several "best actress" awards. Among her roles with the RSC, she was the Duchess inJohn Webster'sThe Duchess of Malfiin 1971.

Nunn's acclaimed production ofMacbethwas first staged with aminimalistdesign atThe Other Placetheatre in Stratford. Its small round stage focused attention on thepsychologicaldynamics of the characters, and bothIan McKellenin the title role, and Dench, received exceptionally favourable notices. "If this is not great acting I don't know what is", wroteMichael BillingtoninThe Guardian. "It will astonish me if the performance is matched by any in this actress's generation", commentedJ. C. TrewininThe Lady. The production transferred to London, opening at theDonmar Warehousein September 1977, and was adapted for television, later released on VHS and DVD.

In January 2001, Dench's husbandMichael Williamsdied of lung cancer. Dench went toNewfoundlandin Canada almost immediately after his funeral to begin production onLasse Hallström's drama filmThe Shipping News, a therapy she later credited as her rescue: "People, friends, kept saying, 'You are not facing up to it; you need to face up to it', and maybe they were right, but I felt I was – in the acting. Grief supplies you with an enormous amount of energy. I needed to use that up."[47]In between, Dench finished work onRichard Eyre's filmIris(2001), in which she portrayed novelistIris Murdoch. Dench shared her role withKate Winslet, both actresses portraying Murdoch at different phases of her life.[48]Each of them was nominated for anOscarthe following year, earning Dench her fourth nomination in five years.[40]In addition, she was awarded both anALFS Awardand theBest Leading Actress Awardat the55th British Academy Film Awards.[40]AfterIris, Dench immediately returned to Canada to finishThe Shipping NewsalongsideKevin SpaceyandJulianne Moore.[47]Based on thePulitzer Prize-winningnovelbyE.

The spy film, directed byLee Tamahori, marked her fourth appearance asMI6head M and the franchise's last performance byPierce Brosnanas Bond.Die Another Dayreceived mixed reviews.[53][54]Regardless, it became the highest-grossing James Bond film up to that time.[55]In the 2002 animated children's seriesAngelina Ballerina, Dench lent her voice to Miss Lilly, Angelina's ballet teacher, and her daughter,Finty Williams, provided the voice of Angelina herself.[citation needed]

She followedRiddickwith a more traditional role inCharles Dance's English dramaLadies in Lavender, also starring friendMaggie Smith. In the film, Dench plays one half of a sister duo and takes it upon herself to nurse a washed up stranger to health, eventually finding herself falling for a man many decades younger than she. The specialty release garnered positive reviews from critics, withRoger Ebertof theChicago Sun-Timescalling it "perfectly sweet and civilized [and] a pleasure to watch Smith and Dench together; their acting is so natural it could be breathing".[60]Also in 2004, Dench provided her voice for several smaller projects. InWalt Disney'sHome on the Range, she, along withRoseanne BarrandJennifer Tilly, voiced a mismatched trio ofdairy cowswho must capture an infamous cattle rustler, for hisbounty, in order to save their idyllic farm from foreclosure. The film was mildly successful for Disney.[61]

A direct sequel to the 2006 filmCasino Royale, Forster felt Dench was underused in the previous films, and wanted to make her part bigger, having her interact with Bond more.[76]The project received mixed reviews from critics, who mainly felt thatQuantum of Solacewas not as impressive as the predecessorCasino Royale,[77]but became another hit for the franchise with a worldwide gross of US$591 million.[78]For her performance, Dench was nominated for aSaturn Awardthe following year.[79]

I had to learn to smoke a joint, and I set my trousers alight", she said about filming.[81]Her next film wasRob Marshall's musical filmNine, based onArthur Kopit'sbookfor the 1982musical of the same name, itself suggested byFederico Fellini's semi-autobiographical film8½.[82]Also starringDaniel Day-Lewis,Marion Cotillard,Penélope Cruz, andSophia Loren, she played Lilli La Fleur, an eccentric but motherly French costume designer, who performs the song "Folies Bergères" in the film.Ninewas nominated for fourAcademy Awards,[83]and awarded both theSatellite Award for Best FilmandBest Cast.[40]Also in 2009, Dench reprised the role of Matilda Jenkyns inReturn to Cranford, the two-part second season of aSimon Curtistelevision series.

Raymond Andrew Winstone(/ˈwɪnstən/; born 19 February 1957)[2]is an English television, stage, and film actor with a career spanning five decades. Having worked with many prominent directors, includingMartin ScorseseandSteven Spielberg, Winstone is perhaps best known for his "hard man" roles, usually delivered in his distinctive London accent. The first of these wasThat Summer!(1979), for which he received a nomination for theBAFTA Award for Best Newcomer. He rose to prominence starring asWill Scarletin the seriesRobin of Sherwoodfrom 1984 to 1986.
Winstone received aBAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Rolenomination for his performance inNil by Mouth(1997). He also starred in the British independent filmsScum(1979),Quadrophenia(1979),The War Zone(1999),Last Orders(2001), andSex & Drugs & Rock & Roll(2010). Winstone's other notable films includeSexy Beast(2000),Ripley's Game(2002),Cold Mountain(2003),King Arthur(2004),The Departed(2006),Beowulf(2007),Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull(2008),Hugo(2011),Snow White and the Huntsman(2012),Black Widow(2021), andDamsel(2024).
Winstone was born on 19 February 1957 inHackney Hospital, London.[2]He first lived in Caistor Park Road,StratfordE15,[3]and attended Portway infants and junior school. He moved toEnfieldwhen he was seven.[2]His mother, Margaret (née Richardson; 1932–1985) had a job emptyingfruit machines, and his father, Raymond J. Winstone (1933–2015), ran a fruit-and-vegetable business.[4][2]
Winstone has recounted how, as a child, he used to play with his friends on bomb sites (empty plots of land with rubble fromSecond World Warbombs).[3]He joinedBrimsdown Primary Schooland in 1968, enrolled toEdmonton County School,[5]which had changed from agrammar schoolto acomprehensiveupon his arrival.[5]He also attendedCorona Theatre School.[2]He did not take to school, eventually leaving with a singleCSE(grade 2) in drama.[6]
He recounted an early encounter with a notorious gangster:
"I was still a baby the dayRonnie Kraycame round to see Dad, but I've been told this story so many times I can see it unfolding in my mind. Everyone was on their best behaviour, but then Ronnie picked me up, and by all accounts I pissed all over him. He had a new mac on, which had probably cost a few bob, and I absolutely covered it. The room fell silent, then Ronnie cracked up, so everyone knew it was safe to join in."[3]
Winstone had an early affinity for acting; his father would take him to the cinema every Wednesday afternoon. Later, he viewedAlbert FinneyinSaturday Night and Sunday Morning, and said: "I thought, 'I could be that geezer'." His other major influences includedJohn Wayne,James Cagney, andEdward G. Robinson. After borrowing extra tuition money from a friend's mother, a drama teacher, Winstone took to the stage, appearing as aCockneynewspaper seller in a production ofEmil and the Detectives.
Winstone was also aboxer.[7]Known to his friends as Winnie, he was called Little Sugs at home (his father already being known as Sugar, afterSugar Ray Robinson). At the age of 12, Winstone joined theRepton Amateur Boxing Club.[2]Over the next 10 years, he won 80 out of 88 bouts.[7]He was London schoolboy champion atwelterweighton three occasions,[7]and fought twice for England.[7]The experience gave him a perspective on his later career: "If you can get in a ring with 2,000 people watching and be smacked around by another guy, then walking onstage isn't hard."[7]
Deciding to pursue drama, Winstone enrolled at theCorona Stage AcademyinHammersmith, when he was aged "about 17".[6][8][3]At£900 a term, it was expensive considering the average wage was then about £36 a week.
Winstone was not popular with the establishment at his secondary school, who considered him a bad influence. When he discovered that he was the only pupil not invited to the Christmas party, he decided to take revenge for this slight. Hammering some pins through a piece of wood, he placed it under the wheel of his headmistress's car and blew out the tyre, for which he was expelled.[6]As a joke, he went up to theBBC, where his schoolmates were involved in an audition, and got one of his own by flirting with the secretary.[2]The audition was for one of the most notorious plays in history –Alan Clarke'sScum– and, because Clarke liked Winstone's cocky, aggressive boxer's walk,[2]he got the part, though it had been written for aGlaswegian.[6]
The play, written byRoy Mintonand directed by Clarke, was a brutal depiction of a young offender's institution. Winstone was cast in the leading role of Carlin, a young offender who struggles against both his captors and his fellow cons to become the "Daddy" of the institution. Hard hitting and often violent (particularly during the infamous "billiards" scene in which Carlin uses two billiard balls stuffed in a sock to beat one of his fellow inmates over the head), the play was judged unsuitable for broadcast by the BBC, and was not shown until 1991. The banned television play was entirely refilmed in 1979 for cinematic release with many of the original actors playing the same roles, including Winstone. In a commentary for theScumDVD, Winstone cites Clarke as a major influence on his career and laments the director's death in 1990 from cancer.[9]
While Winstone has portrayed many characters who share the "hard man" nature of his performance inScum, he has also explored a variety of other roles, including comedy (Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence) and as the romantic lead (Fanny and Elvis). His favourite role wasHenry VIIIin the2003 TV serial of the same name, remarking at the time: "It's really flattering for me to be asked to play a king. I mean, I'm a kid out ofPlaistow, and I'm playing one of the most famous kings of England. It's fantastic!"[10]
In 1975, Winstone landed his first professional role inWhat a Crazy Worldat theTheatre Royal,Stratfordin London.[11]One of his first TV appearances came in the 1976 "Loving Arms" episode of the popular police seriesThe Sweeney,[12]where he was credited as "Raymond Winstone" (as he was inWhat a Crazy World[11]) and played a minor part as an unnamed young thug. After a short run in the TV seriesFox(1980), and a role inLadies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains(1982),[12]alongsideDiane LaneandLaura Dern. He starred in the opening episode of the third season ofBergerac(1983), asWill ScarletinRobin of Sherwood.[6]He again teamed up withJason Conneryin a film which also featuredAmanda DonohoeandMaria Whittaker, inTank Malling(1984).[12]

During this period, he was increasingly drawn to the theatre, playing inHinkemannin 1988,Some Voicesin 1994, andDealer's ChoiceandPale Horsethe following year. Ray also added his London accent to a dance track in 1982 by Marsha Raven called "I Like Plastic".
Winstone was asked to appear inMr Thomas,[6]a play written by his friend and fellow LondonerKathy Burke. The reviews were good, and led to Winstone being cast, alongside Burke, inGary Oldman's dramaNil By Mouth(1997).[12]He was widely lauded for his performance as an alcoholicwife-batterer, receiving aBAFTAnomination (17 years after his Best Newcomer award forThat Summer).[12]He continued to play "tough guy" roles inFaceandThe War Zone– the latter especially controversial, as he played a man who rapes his own daughter – but that obvious toughness also allowed him to play loved-up nice-guys in romantic comediesFanny and ElvisandThere's Only One Jimmy Grimble. InLast Christmas, he played a dead man, now a trainee angel, who returns from heaven to help his young son cope with his bereavement which was written byTony Grounds. In 1995, he played the sinister and mysterious Thane in the comedy drama seriesThe Ghostbusters of East Finchley. The series was also written by Grounds, with whom Winstone worked again onBirths, Marriages & DeathsandOur Boy, the latter winning him theRoyal Television SocietyBest Actor Award.
