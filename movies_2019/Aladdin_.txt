Produced byWalt Disney PicturesandRideback, it is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1992 animated filmAladdin, itself based on "Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp", a French addition to the Middle Eastern folktale collectionOne Thousand and One Nights.[1][a]The film starsWill Smith,Mena MassoudandNaomi ScottwithMarwan Kenzari,Navid Negahban,Nasim Pedrad, andBilly Magnussenin supporting roles. The plot followsAladdin, a street urchin, as he falls in love withPrincess Jasmine, befriends a wish-granting genie, and battles the wicked sorcererJafar.
In October 2016, Disney announced Ritchie would direct a live-action remake of Aladdin. Smith was the first member of the cast to join, signing on to portray Genie in July 2017, and Massoud and Scott were confirmed for the two lead roles later that month.Principal photographybegan that September atLongcross StudiosinSurrey, England, also filming in theWadi Rum DesertinJordan, and lasted until January 2018. Additional filming andpick-upstook place in August 2018.
Aladdinpremiered at theGrand Rexin Paris on May 8, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on May 24. It grossed over $1Â billion worldwide, making it theninth highest-grossing film of 2019. Amongst Disney'slive-action remakes, the film is thesixth-most-expensiveandthird-highest-grossingreadaptation to date. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its music, costume design, direction, and the performances of Smith, Massoud, and Scott but criticism for the CGI, pacing, and Kenzari's characterization of Jafar.
In the fictional city ofAgrabah(based onBaghdad), an orphanedstreet urchinnamed Aladdin and his monkey, Abu, meet Princess Jasmine, who has snuck away from her sheltered life in the royal palace. She wishes to succeed her father as Sultan but is instead expected to marry one of her royal suitors, including the handsome yet dimwited Prince Anders. Jafar, theroyal vizier, schemes to overthrow the Sultan and seeks amagic lampfrom the Cave of Wonders, that only "the diamond in the rough" can retrieve.
While sneaking into the palace to visit Jasmine, Aladdin and Abu are captured by Jafar. He offers to make Aladdin rich enough to impress Jasmine in exchange for retrieving the lamp from the Cave of Wonders. Once there, Aladdin frees amagic carpetand finds the lamp. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, who double-crosses him and kicks him and Abu back into the cave, but not before Abu steals the lamp back.
Trapped in the cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unwittingly summoning the omnipotentGenieinside, who has the power to grant three wishes to anyone who has the lamp. Aladdin gets them out of the cave without using a wish, on a technicality. Determined to woo Jasmine, he uses his official first wish to become a prince and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude and turn him human.
Aladdin makes an extravagant arrival at Agrabah as "Prince Ali of Ababwa", but he struggles to impress Jasmine. Posing as Aladdin's human attendant, the Genie is mutually smitten with Dalia, Jasmine'shandmaiden. Aladdin and Jasmine bond when he takes her on a ride on the magic carpet. Tricked into revealing his true identity, he lies to her, saying that he actually is a prince and dressed like a peasant to explore Agrabah.
Having also discovered Aladdin's identity, Jafar kidnaps Aladdin and throws him into themoat, knowing that if he survives, it will prove that he has the lamp. The Genie rescues Aladdin, at the cost of his second wish. Once rescued, Aladdin returns to the palace and destroys Jafar's magiccobrastaff, ending his spell over the Sultan and revealing his plot. Jafar is then arrested and imprisoned in the dungeons. The Sultan allows Aladdin to marry Jasmine. Aladdin goes back on his promise to free the Genie, feeling uncertain of being able to keep up his charade without him. Dismayed that Aladdin will continue living a lie, the Genie retreats to his lamp.
Freed by hisparrotsidekick Iago, Jafar steals the lamp and becomes the Genie's new master. He uses his first wish to become sultan and his second one to become the world's most powerful sorcerer. Jafar then exposes Aladdin, exiling him and Abu to a frozen wasteland, and tortures the Sultan and Dalia until Jasmine agrees to marry him. The Genie secretly teleports the magic carpet to rescue Aladdin and Abu behind Jafar's back. At the wedding, as Aladdin returns to Agrabah, Jasmine steals the lamp from Jafar and jumps onto the magic carpet. Jafar then uses a sand twister to recapture Aladdin and Jasmine and destroy the magic carpet.
As Jafar holds Jasmine, Dalia, and the Sultan under his magic, Aladdin taunts Jafar for being second in power to the Genie, goading him into using his last wish to become "the most powerful being in the universe". Jafar turns into a genie and becomes trapped inside his own lamp, dragging Iago with him, and the Genie banishes them to the Cave of Wonders. Abu rescues the magic carpet and Genie fixes it up. Jasmine, Dalia, and the Sultan are freed from Jafar's magic. The Genie encourages Aladdin to use his third wish to regain his royal title and legally marry Jasmine. Aladdin instead keeps his promise and frees the Genie by using his last wish, allowing him to live as a human. Dalia, the Genie, and the Sultan know that Jasmine loves Aladdin. The Sultan crowns Jasmine the newsultana-regnant, no longer bound to marry a prince, and she and Aladdin marry. Meanwhile, the Genie marries Dalia, and they start a family as they explore the world together.
Numan AcarportraysHakim, the head of the palace guards who is loyal to the Sultan of Agrabah.Alan Tudykprovides the voice ofIago, Jafar's sardonic and intelligentscarlet macawcompanion.[14]This is the first instance where the character is not voiced byGilbert Gottfried. In this film, Iago is portrayed as a more realistic parrot.
Frank Welkerreprises his roles as the vocal effects forAbu, Aladdin'skleptomaniacbut loyal petTufted capuchin[15][16][17]and the voice ofthe Cave of Wonders, a sand guardian who guards the magic lamp from intruders and only gives it to someone who's worthy, "a diamond in the rough". Out of the two roles the latter is the only one for which he receives credit.
Additionally, Taliyah Blair and Jordan A. Nash respectively play Genie and Dalia's daughter and son,LianandOmar. Also, Robby Haynes portraysRazoul, a palace guard.Nina WadiaplaysZulla, a market trader who dislikes Aladdin. Wadia describes her appearance as "more of a cameo" as extra footage was needed after filming had wrapped.[18]
On October 10, 2016, it was announced thatGuy Ritchiewould direct alive-actionAladdinfilm forWalt Disney Pictures, withJohn Augustwriting the script andDan Linand Jonathan Eirich attached as producers. The studio said that the film would be "an ambitious and nontraditional" take on the tale ofAladdinthat would keep the musical elements of theoriginal film. On the nontraditional aspect, the studio had originally planned for the film to be told in anonlinearformat.[19][20]
On July 17, 2017, it was announced that Disney had hiredVanessa Taylorto polish the original screenplay by August, specifically some "character work" and what is called "script doctoring".[21]Meanwhile, Richie and the studio focused on casting the other main roles with filming slated to start in August in London.[22]
When asked about Ritchie's take on the film,Pasek & Pauldescribed it as "very muscular and action-packed."[23][24][25]
In February 2017, Lin said that they were looking for a diverse cast and that they would not try "to makePrince of Persia".[26]A worldwide casting call for the lead roles ofAladdinandPrincess Jasminecommenced in March 2017, with principal production set to take place in the UK from July 2017 until January 2018.[27]The call for the titular role included both South Asian and Southwest Asian (Arab) actors, which some critics suggested was "a simplistic conflation" that signaled "an ignorance offensive to both cultures".[28]On April 19, 2017, it was reported thatWill Smithwas in talks to playGenie, for which was confirmed in July.[29][30][31]In August, Dutch actorMarwan Kenzarijoined the cast asJafar, withNasim Pedradcast in a newly created role as Mara, "a hand maid and friend of Jasmine" who serves as a "comic relief".Numan Acarwas set to playHakim.[32][33]The following month,Billy Magnussenjoined the cast in a newly created role as Prince Anders, alongsideNavid Negahbanasthe Sultan.[34][35]
In May 2017,Little MixmemberJade Thirlwallwas in talks for the part of Princess Jasmine.[36]On July 11, 2017, it was announced that principal production onAladdinhad been pushed back by a month, to August 2017, due to struggles in finding the right actor to portray the titular role. Over 2,000 actors and actresses had auditioned for the roles of Aladdin and Jasmine, but finding a male lead of Middle Eastern or Indian descent in his 20s who could act and sing was seemingly difficult for the producers.[28]Naomi ScottandTara Sutariawere the final two actresses in the running for the role of Jasmine, but neither could be cast until a chemistry test was done with whoever would be cast as Aladdin. The studio was initially interested inDev PatelorRiz Ahmedfor Aladdin, but later decided to cast a relative newcomer.[30]Achraf Koutet,Mena Massoudand George Kosturos were among the actors being tested for the role.[30]Twomusical filmveterans,Marc Platt(who would serve as executive producer) and Chris Montan, were consulted before a final decision was made.[30]
At the 2017D23 Expo, on July 15, it was announced that Massoud would star as Aladdin and Scott as Jasmine, ending the four-month long open casting call.[31][37]Julie Ann Crommett, Disney's Vice President of Multicultural Engagement, said the decision to cast Scottâthe daughter of anEnglishfather and aGujaratiUgandan-Indianmotherâas Jasmine, reflected the mixing or association of different cultures in the broad region that consists of theMiddle East,South Asia, andChina, all of which make up theSilk Road.[38]
On December 20, 2018,Gilbert Gottfriedsaid that he was not asked to reprise his role asIago, Jafar's pet parrot.[39]In March 2019, it was announced thatAlan Tudykwould voice the character instead.[14]In May 2019, Welker was announced as reprising his role asRajah, Jasmine's pet tiger,[40]and the trailer had confirmed that Welker would reprise his role asthe Cave of Wondersas well.
Principal photographybegan on September 6, 2017, atLongcross StudiosinSurrey, England, andwrappedon January 24, 2018.[41][42][43][44]Part of the film was shot inWadi RumDesert, Jordan.[45][46]The Royal Film Commissionprovided support to the production during filming and assisted in facilitating logistics. Reshoots took place during August 2018.[47]The film's production sets were designed byGame of Thronesproduction designerGemma Jackson.[48]The "Prince Ali" musical sequence features 1,000 dancers and extras.[49]Smith frequentlyimprovisesthroughout the film. Massoud also revealed that there was a whole scene, where Prince Ali and Genie meet the royal family for the first time, that was improvised by the cast.[50]
The visual effects were provided byIndustrial Light & Magicand supervised by Michael Mullholland, Daniele Bigi, and David Seager, with the help of Hybride Technologies,DNEG, Nzviage and Proof.[51]
In January 2018, it was reported that brown makeup was being applied to white extras during filming in order to "blend in", which caused an outcry and condemnation among fans and critics, branding the practice as "an insult to the whole industry" while accusing the producers of not recruiting people with Middle Eastern or North African heritage. Disney responded to the controversy saying, "Diversity of our cast and background performers was a requirement and only in a handful of instances when it was a matter of specialty skills, safety and control (special effects rigs, stunt performers and handling of animals) were crew made up to blend in."[52][53]
The decision to cast Billy Magnussen as an entirely new character not seen in the original film also drew criticism from fans. Some viewed the creation of his character as unnecessary, while others accused the film ofwhitewashing, since Magnussen iswhite.[54][55]ButThe Washington Postpointed out that Nasim Pedrad, an actress ofIranian-Americandescent, also was cast as a brand new character when she was awarded the role of Jasmine's friend Mara (later renamed Dalia).[54]
Alan Menkenwas brought in to compose the score for the film, reprising his duties from the original animated film.Pasek & Paulwrote a new song with Menken, and several songs from the original film by Menken,Howard Ashman, andTim Ricewere featured in the remake.

The trailer had a much more positive reception than the previous one, as it featured several songs from the original film and more of Smith not entirely in motion-capture. His CGI scenes received better notices, as well, although it was still mostly criticized by some critics when the film was released.[69][70]

Writing for theChicago Sun-Times,Richard Roepergave the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising Smith, Scott, and Massoud's performances and calling it a "shining, shimmering live-action update."[118]Variety's Peter Debruge summarized his review with, "Will Smith steps into Robin Williams's shoes, bringing fresh attitude to the role of the Genie in Guy Ritchie's high-risk, mostly rewarding live-action remake." However, he criticized Kenzari's performance as Jafar, saying: "Dutch actor Marwan Kenzari may be a handsome alternative to the animated versionâs effete vizier, with his pencil moustache and Sophia Loren eyes, but he no longer looms large enough to feel like much of a threat."[119]AMir Fantastikireview by Yevgeniy Peklo gave the film a score of 8/10, saying it was "probably the best Disney live-action remake up to date."[120]
Despite praising the cast, William Bibbiani ofTheWrapsaid of the film, "If you don't think about it very hard (although you probably should), the remake ofAladdinmight entertain you. But you'd be a heck of a lot more entertained by watching the original film again. Or by going to a real-life parade. Or by doing some light gardening. Or by doing a crossword puzzle."[121]Chris Nashawaty ofEntertainment Weeklygave the film a C+, lamenting that it did not add anything new to its1992 animated predecessor; he felt that the film was unable to update the original's questionable Middle Eastern characterizations but nevertheless praised Smith's and Scott's performances.[122]Mark Kennedy of theAssociated Presswrote that "Guy Ritchie... was always an odd choice to helm a big Disney romantic musical and proves utterly the wrong guy here.Aladdin, in his hands, is more likeThe MummythanFrozen."[123]
Before filming had started, some commentators criticized racial politics implied by the film's production elements and plot. Some expressed skepticism after the casting process about its conflation of Arab and Middle Eastern culture and "lack of specificity and care".[124]In a review in7iber, Lamees Assaf observed that "the people and the setting looked more likeIndiathan a city inthe Middle East." She also critiqued gendered andorientaliststereotypes as reified by the film, writing that "[i]n the eyes of Disney and Hollywood, the stereotypical image of the Arab girlâ the belly dancer with a small waist and long hairâ and the dark-skinned, jealous, and chivalrous Arab man defending and protecting his women from harmâs way, is much more attractive than actual Arabs, who are truly boring in reality."[28]
"Speechless", a new original song written for Jasmine, was shortlisted for theAcademy Award for Best Original Songat the92nd Academy Awards, but was ultimately not nominated.[137][138]
On August 12, 2019, producer Lin announced his enthusiasm for a sequel and revealed that Disney is in the early stages of developing a follow-up.[139]The studio also hopes to bring back Ritchie to direct and Smith to reprise his role as the Genie while also telling a story that's "fresh and new".[140][141][142][143][144]He later stated that if they would make a sequel toAladdin, it would not be a direct adaptation of the animated filmsThe Return of JafarorAladdin and the King of Thievesbut could borrow elements of them. It was also said that they would look at various sources for the sequel's story.[145]
On February 12, 2020,Varietyofficially confirmed that a sequel is in development, withJohn GatinsandAndrea Berloffset to write the script. Lin and Eirich were set to return as producers, and Massoud, Smith, and Scott were expected to reprise their roles.Aladdin 2was officially announced once the producers decided they had a good story and knew their path ahead.[146][147]In January 2023, it was revealed that Smith was still set to return as the Genie in spite of theincident where he slappedChris Rockat theAcademy Awards event in 2022. Furthermore, he was reportedly expected to have a bigger role in the sequel.[148]However, Massoud later said that it was "very unlikely at this point" onTwitteron March 14. This led to rumors that the sequel had been cancelled.[149]The subject would be brought up again on May 13, 2023, when Massoud responded to a Twitter post fromThe Hollywood Handleabout the box office projections for Disney's live-action remake ofThe Little Mermaid(which also involved Marc Platt as a producer), by saying that it won't reach the $1 billion mark likeAladdindid, but that it "undoubtedly will get a sequel," explaining that "Our film was unique in that audiences went to watch it multiple times." His response received backlash, resulting in Massoud deactivating his Twitter account.[150]However, he would end up getting part of his prediction right, asThe Little Mermaidfailed to reach $1 billion at the box office.[151][152]It was speculated that his words may have also come from his frustrations over the struggle of Disney developing theAladdinsequel.[150]On December 15, 2023, Massoud said "I don't have any updates" about the sequel. He also said that he thinks the Hollywood artists' strike may have stalled the project but, with the strike over, he is now waiting for further news. Unsure if the sequel will be made, he also said, "For me, at a certain point, life goes on."[153]
A year before deciding to remakeAladdin, Disney made an announcement in 2015 that it would make a live-action prequel to the aforementioned film above under the titleGenies. The new film was reported to focus on genies and their realm and reveal how Aladdin's genie ended up in the lamp. WritersMark Swift and Damian Shannonwere hired to write the script, whileTripp Vinsonwas to serve as a producer under his Vinson Films banner.[154]However, as of 2021 the film was reportedly scrapped.[citation needed]
A spin-off film focused on Prince Anders was announced in December 2019 to be in development forDisney+with Jordan Dunn and Michael Kvamme writing the script and Magnussen reprising his role.[155]In April 2021, Magnussen stated that project was still in development and that writers Shane Andries and Chris Smith had been hired to do additional work on the script.[156]In May 2022, Magnussen once again said that the film is still in the works and going through rewrites.[157]

Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5Â billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984â1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter filmâthe first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 ratingâbegana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4Â billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Igerâand later studio chairmanAlan HornâWalt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studioâincluding PG-13 rated films and belowâunless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20Â million and $60Â million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3â4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectivelyâoverseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWÄtÄ FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle. Its first film appearance was with the release ofStrange World.[60]The logo received widespread praise from critics and audiences and won Gold in the "Theatrical | Film: Design" medium at the 2023Clio Entertainment Awardsin November 2023. The standard version of the logo premiered theatrically withThe Beach Boys.[61]

Massoud takes inspiration fromRobin Williams. In an interview withThe Hudsucker, he stated that Robin Williams was the actor who impacted him the most, saying "He was an incredibly well-rounded actor but I grew up on his role inMrs. Doubtfire.
