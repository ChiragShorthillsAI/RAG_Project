The film follows a sports agent who must pull off a plan in 72 hours, pitching a controversial opportunity to his client, a rookie basketball player during the company's lockout. The film was shot entirely on theiPhone 8, becoming Soderbergh's second film to be shot on an iPhone, afterUnsane.
The film had its world premiere at theSlamdance Film Festivalon January 27, 2019, and was released on February 8, 2019, byNetflix. The film received positive reviews from critics, which praised its performances, Soderbergh's direction, themes, editing, shooting style, and screenplay.
Ray Burke is an agent working for aNew Yorksports agency that finds itself in the middle of alockout. After his credit card is declined at an upscale restaurant, his boss David Starr tells him that the company is losing clients, the bank accounts and credit cards of the employees are frozen, and that he could be fired along with other employees. This forces Ray to look for a plan that could save the company from the lockout as well as give his client, Erick Scott, new opportunities. He recruits the help of his former assistant, Sam.
The next day, Ray visits newly drafted Jamero Umber's mother, Emera, with an offer. She refuses and reaffirms that she is the only agent and lawyer that her son will ever need. Ray's ex-wife, Myra, tells him that the company is in a lockout and will need to renegotiate new terms with agents and players. However, they will need to wait over a month to settle, as the team owners are at a standstill with the TV networks over millions of dollars. Ray asks her to cancel the deal, convinced that the players won't be paid well during the lockout, which could last up to six months. Meanwhile, future teammates Erick Scott and Jamero Umber have an argument onTwitter, heavily publicized by media outlets.
Ray heads to Back Court Day, an annual event at a community center featuring a basketball camp for local kids and appearances by star athletes. While Erick is signing autographs and answering questions, Jamero arrives with his mother in tow. Erick and Jamero confront each other about their Twitter argument; tensions rise as they trade insults. They end up playing a one-on-one basketball game, which is recorded by the kids on their phones. A video is posted on social media and goes viral, garnering 24 million views. Ray gets the idea to stream games on streaming services and social media sites likeSnapchat,YouTube, andNetflix, thus enabling the players to make money during the lockout. Erick is not convinced though, and feels he could put his place in the NBA at risk. Nevertheless, he accepts.
The next day Sam meets with Ray to discuss their careers going forward. Sam mentions to Ray that Erick might fire him, as he's looking to "move laterally" within the company. Erick fires Ray for lying to him about the fact that everything was for money. However, Ray's plan succeeds and the players who signed with the company remained signed, meaning that Erick was never in danger and will be able to play in the league once the lockout is over. Ray reveals to Starr that the entire plan to take players to pay-per-view/streaming platforms was all a ruse to force the end of the lockout. It is implied that, through his actions, Ray has taken over Starr's position at the agency. Sam goes to work for the Players’ Association as she and Erick begin a relationship. Sam opens the package Ray gave Erick earlier, which he called a "Bible". The package containsHarry Edwards's bookThe Revolt of the Black Athlete. Sam begins to read it as Erick showers. Back at the agency, Ray is shown entering a meeting with Edwards. After Erick exits the shower and asks about the package, Sam replies:  "You need to read this."
Additionally,Skip Bayless,Shannon Sharpe,Joy Taylor, Evan Rosenblum, Van Lathan, and Kristina Pink appear as themselves. Basketball playersReggie Jackson,Karl-Anthony Towns, andDonovan Mitchellmake appearances as themselves in individual interview scenes.

"I'd been in conversations with Netflix duringUnsane[also shot on an iPhone], and when I ended up going in a different way, I said, 'Look, I have this other thing, I will make sure you get eyes on it early.' When it was basically finished, I brought it to them and they said, 'Great, we'd like to buy it.' It felt like, the kind of film it is, the best way to maximize eyeballs. It's got a better shot at finding all the people who will like it. Otherwise, it's a slow-rolling platform release, which are expensive and you're bound by where the big arthouse theaters are. You can't just go anywhere. I just felt I'd rather have it drop and have everybody be able to see it."[16]

Steven Andrew Soderbergh(/ˈsoʊdərˌbɜːrɡ/SOH-dər-burg; born January 14, 1963)[1]is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, cinematographer, and editor. A pioneer of modernindependent cinema, Soderbergh later drew acclaim for formally inventive films made within thestudio system.
Soderbergh's directorial breakthrough, the indie dramaSex, Lies, and Videotape(1989), lifted him into the public spotlight as a notable presence in the film industry. At 26, Soderbergh became the youngest solo director to win thePalme d'Orat theCannes Film Festival, and the film garnered worldwide commercial success, as well asnumerous accolades. His next five films, including the critically laudedKing of the Hill(1993), found limited commercial success. He pivoted into more mainstream fare with the crime comedyOut of Sight(1998), the biopicErin Brockovich(2000) and the crime dramaTraffic(2000). ForTraffic, he won theAcademy Award for Best Director.
Soderbergh found further popular and critical success with theOcean'strilogy and film franchise(2001–18),Che(2008),The Informant!(2009),Contagion(2011),Haywire(2011), theMagic Miketrilogy (2012-23),Side Effects(2013),Behind the Candelabra(2013),Logan Lucky(2017),Unsane(2018),Let Them All Talk(2020),No Sudden Move(2021), andKimi(2022). His film career spans a multitude of genres but his specialties arepsychological,crime, andheist films. His films have grossed over US$2.2 billion worldwide and garnered fourteenAcademy Awardnominations, winning five.
Soderbergh's films often revolve around familiar concepts which are regularly used for big-budget Hollywood movies, but he routinely employs anavant-gardearthouseapproach. They center on themes of shiftingpersonal identities, vengeance,sexuality, morality, and thehuman condition. His feature films are often distinctive in the realm ofcinematographyas a result of his having been influenced byavant-garde cinema, coupled with his use of unconventionalfilmandcamera formats. Many of Soderbergh's films are anchored by multi-dimensional storylines withplot twists,nonlinear storytelling,experimental sequencing, suspensefulsoundscapes, and third-person vantage points.
Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, inAtlanta, Georgia, to Mary Ann (néeBernard) and Peter Andrew Soderbergh, who was a university administrator and educator. Soderbergh hasSwedish,Irish, andItalianroots.[2]His paternal grandfather immigrated to the U.S. fromStockholm.[3]
As a child, he moved with his family toCharlottesville, Virginia, where he lived during his adolescence, and then toBaton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father became Dean of Education atLouisiana State University(LSU).[2]Soderbergh discovered filmmaking as a teenager and directed short films with aSuper 8and16 mm cameras.[4]He attended theLouisiana State University Laboratory Schoolfor high school before graduating and moving toHollywoodto pursue professional filmmaking.
In his first job, he worked as a game showcomposerand cue card holder; soon after which he found work as a freelance film editor. During this time, he directed the concert video9012Livefor the rock bandYesin 1985, for which he received aGrammy Awardnomination forBest Music Video, Long Form.[5]
After Soderbergh returned to Baton Rouge, he wrote the screenplay forSex, Lies, and Videotapeon alegal padduring an eight-day cross-country drive.[6]The film tells the story of a troubled man who videotapes women discussing their lives and sexuality, and his impact on the relationship of a married couple.[7]Soderbergh submittedSex, Lies, and Videotapeto the1989 Cannes Film Festivalwhere, at age 26, he became the youngest solo director to win thePalme d'Or, the top prize.[8][9]Its critical performance led it to become a worldwide commercial success, grossing $36.7 million on a $1.2 million budget.[10]
Sex, Lies, and Videotapeis considered to be the most influential catalyst of the 1990sIndependent Cinemamovement.[11][12]Film criticRoger Ebertcalled Soderbergh the "poster boyof theSundancegeneration".[13]His relative youth and sudden rise to prominence in the film industry had him referred to as a "sensation" and a prodigy.[14][15]In 2006,Sex, Lies, and Videotapewas selected by theLibrary of Congressfor preservation in the United StatesNational Film Registry, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and theAmerican Film Institutenominated it as one of the greatest movies ever made.[16][17]
When I say this is the most important motion picture you'll ever attend, my motivation is not financial gain, but a firm belief that the delicate fabric that holds all of us together will be ripped apart unless every man, woman, and child in this country sees this film and pays full ticket price, not some bargainmatinéecut-rate deal.
Soderbergh's directorial debut was followed by a series of low-budget box-office disappointments.[18][19]In 1991, he directedKafka,a biographical film ofFranz Kafkawritten byLem Dobbsand starringJeremy Irons. The film returned one tenth of its budget and received mixed reviews from critics.[20]Roger Ebert's review stated: "Soderbergh does demonstrate again here that he's a gifted director, however unwise in his choice of project".[21]Two years later, he directed the dramaKing of the Hill(1993), which again underperformed commercially, but fared well with critics.[22]Based on the memoir of writerA. E. Hotchner, the film is set during theGreat Depressionand follows a young boy (played byJesse Bradford) struggling to survive on his own in a hotel inSt. Louisafter his mother falls ill and his father is away on business trips.[23]Also in 1995, he directed a remake ofRobert Siodmak's 1949 film noirCriss Cross, titledThe Underneath, which grossed $536,020 on a $6.5 million budget and was widely panned by critics.[24]Soderbergh has since called the film "dead on arrival" and described the making of it as his bottoming out.[25]
Soderbergh, formerly a member ofWriters Guild of America West, left and maintainedfinancial corestatus in 1995.[26]
Soderbergh directedSchizopolisin 1996, a comedy which he starred in, wrote, composed and shot as well as directed. The film was submitted to theCannes Film Festivalto such a "chilly response" that he reworked the entire introduction and conclusion before releasing it commercially.[27]In the movie's introduction, he said: "In the event that you find certain sequences or events confusing, please bear in mind this is your fault, not ours. You will need to see the picture again and again until you understand everything".[28]He starred inSchizopolisas Fletcher Munson, a spokesman for aScientology-esque lifestyle cult, and again as Dr. Jeffrey Korchek, a dentist having an affair with Munson's wife.[28]The film switched languages multiple times mid-scene without subtitles, leaving large parts of it incomprehensible.[28]It was viewed by a critic as a "directorial palate cleanse" for Soderbergh.[29]During the months following his debut ofSchizopolis, he released a small, edited version of theSpalding Graymonologue filmGray's Anatomy.Soderbergh would later refer toSchizopolisas his "artistic wake-up call".[28]Soderbergh co-wrote the script for the 1997 horror-thrillerNightwatchwith Danish filmmakerOle Bornedal.Nightwatchis an English-language remake of Bornedal's ownfilm of the same name, which was produced three years earlier in Denmark.[30]
Soderbergh's reemergence began in 1998 withOut of Sight, a stylized adaptation of anElmore Leonardnovel, written byScott Frankand starringGeorge ClooneyandJennifer Lopez.[31]The film was widely praised, though only a moderate box-office success.[32]The critical reception of the movie began a multi-movie artistic partnership between Clooney and Soderbergh. Soderbergh followed up on the success ofOut of Sightby making another crime caper,The Limey(1999), from a screenplay byLem Dobbsand starring actorsTerence StampandPeter Fonda. The film was well-received and established him within thecinematic nicheof thriller and heist films.[33]He ventured into his first biographical film in 2000 when he directedErin Brockovich, written bySusannah Grantand starringJulia Robertsin herOscar-winning role as a single mother taking on industry in a civil action.[34]In late 2000, Soderbergh releasedTraffic, a social drama written byStephen Gaghanand featuring an ensemble cast.[35]Timecompared him to a baseball player hittinghome runswithErin BrockovichandTraffic.[35]Both films would be nominated at the2001 Academy Awards, making him the first director to have been nominated in the same year forBest Directorfor two different films since Michael Curtiz in 1938. He was awarded theAcademy Award for Best DirectorforTrafficand received best director nominations at the year'sGolden Globeand theDirectors Guild of AmericaAwards.[36][37]
In early 2001, he was approached to directOcean's Eleven, a reboot of the 1960sRat Pack-movieOcean's 11written byTed Griffin. After Griffin wrote the screenplay, Soderbergh signed on to direct. The film opened to critical acclaim and widespread commercial success.[38]It quickly became Soderbergh's highest-grossing movie to date, grossing more than $183 million domestically and more than $450 million worldwide.[39][40]Rolling Stonecredited the movie with "[spawning] a new era of heist movies".[38]In the same year, Soderbergh madeFull Frontal, which was shot mostly on digital video in an improvisational style that deliberately blurred the line between which actors were playing characters and which were playing fictionalized versions of themselves.[41]A year later, he was asked by executives atWarner BrosStudios to direct the psychological thrillerInsomnia(2002), starring Academy Award winnersAl Pacino,Robin Williams, andHilary Swank. Despite their insistence, Soderbergh declined, preferring to see it directed by up-and-coming directorChristopher Nolan.[42]
Before returning to theOcean'sseries, Soderbergh directedK Street(2003), a ten-part politicalHBOseries he co-produced with George Clooney.[43]The series was both partially improvised and each episode being produced in the five days prior to airing to take advantage of topical events that could be worked into the fictional narrative.[44]Actual political players appeared as themselves, either incameosor portraying fictionalized versions of themselves, notablyJames CarvilleandMary Matalin.[44]
The reason my career took such a left turn at a certain point was because I realized I was in danger of becoming aformalist. But that wasn't the best representation of me–even as a person. It's easy to fall into that because it's a very isolated position to occupy and it's easy to keep other elements–people and ideas–at a distance.
Soderbergh directedOcean's Twelve, a sequel toOcean's Eleven, in 2004. The second installment received muted critical reviews, and was another commercially successful film, grossing $362.7 million on a $110 million budget.[46]Matt Singer ofIndieWirecalled it a "Great Sequel About How Hard It Is to Make a Great Sequel."[47][48]Also in 2004, Soderbergh produced and co-wrote the adapted screenplay for the filmCriminal—a remake of the Argentine filmNine Queens—with his longtime assistant directorGregory Jacobs, who made his directorial debut with the film.[49]
A year later, Soderbergh directedBubble(2005), a $1.6 million film featuring a cast of nonprofessional actors. It opened in selected theaters andHDNetsimultaneously, and four days later onDVD. Industry heads were reportedly watching how the film performed, as its unusual release schedule could have implications for future feature films.[50][51]Theater-owners, who at the time had been suffering from dropping attendance rates, did not welcome so-called "day-and-date" movies.[52]National Association of Theatre Ownerschief executive John Fithian indirectly called the film's release model "the biggest threat to the viability of thecinema industrytoday."[53]Soderbergh's response to such criticism: "I don't think it's going to destroy the movie-going experience any more than the ability to get takeout has destroyed the restaurant business."[54]A romantic drama set in post-war Berlin,The Good German, starringCate Blanchettand Clooney, was released in late 2006. The film performed poorly commercially grossing $5.9 million worldwide against a budget of $32 million.[55]
Soderbergh next directedOcean's Thirteen, which was released in June 2007 to further commercial success and increased critical acclaim.[56]Grossing $311.3 million on an $85 million budget, it is the second highest-grossing film of his career after the firstOcean's.[57]The film concluded what would later be known as theOcean'strilogy, a collection of heist movies that would go on to be described as defining a new era of heist films.[58]Soderbergh directedChe, which was released in theaters in two parts, titledThe ArgentineandGuerrilla, and was presented in the main competition of the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, on May 22.Benicio del Toroplayed the Argentine guerrillaErnesto "Che" Guevarain an epic four-hour double bill which looks first at his role in theCuban Revolutionbefore moving to his campaign and eventual death in Bolivia.[59]Soderbergh shot his feature filmThe Girlfriend Experiencein New York in 2008. Soderbergh cast adult film starSasha Greyas the film's lead actress to great reception and controversy.[60][61]

Whitacre wore a wire for2+1⁄2years for theFBIas a high-level executive at aFortune 500company,Archer Daniels Midland(ADM), in one of the largestprice-fixingcases in history. The film was released on September 18, 2009. The script for the movie was written by Scott Z. Burns based onKurt Eichenwald's book,The Informant. The film grossed $41 million on a $22 million budget and received generally favorable reviews from critics.[62][63]Also in 2009, Soderbergh shot a small improvised film with the cast of the play,The Last Time I Saw Michael Gregg, a comedy about a theatre company staging Chekhov'sThree Sisters. He has stated that he does not want it seen by the public, and only intended it for the cast. Soderbergh nearly filmed a feature adaptation of the baseball bookMoneyball, starringBrad PittandJonah Hill. The book, byMichael Lewis, tells of howBilly Beane, general manager ofOakland Athletics, usedstatistical analysisto make up for what he lacked in funds to beat the odds and lead his team to a series of notable wins in 2002. Disagreements between Sony and Soderbergh about revisions toSteven Zaillian's version of the screenplay led to Soderbergh's dismissal from the project only days prior to filming in June 2009. In 2010, Soderbergh shot the action-thrillerHaywire, starringGina Carano,Ewan McGregor,Michael FassbenderandChanning Tatumwhich, even though was shot in early 2010, was not released until January 2012.[64]

In August 2011, Soderbergh served as asecond unit directoronThe Hunger Gamesand filmed much of the District 11 riot scene.[68][69]In September and October 2011, he shotMagic Mike, a film starringChanning Tatum, about the actor's experiences working as a male stripper in his youth.

The film was released on June 29, 2012, to a strong commercial performance and favorable critical acclaim.[70]Throughout 2012, Soderbergh had announced his intention to retire from feature filmmaking. He stated that "when you reach the point where you're saying, 'If I have to get into a van to do another scout, I'm just going to shoot myself,' it's time to let somebody who's still excited about getting in the van, get in the van."[71]Soderbergh later said that he would retire from filmmaking and begin to explore painting.[72]A few weeks later, Soderbergh played down his earlier comments, saying a filmmaking "sabbatical" was more accurate.[73]For his then-final feature film, he directed the psychological thrillerSide Effects, which starredJude Law,Rooney Mara,Channing TatumandCatherine Zeta-Jones.

It was written by Ed Solomon, who also wroteMosaic, and follows "an investigation into a botched kidnapping" that "uncovers long-held secrets connecting multiple characters and cultures in present-day New York City".[122]It premiered onMaxon July 13, 2023.[123]Also in July 2023, Soderbergh debuted his science fiction web seriesCommand Z, which is inspired byKurt Andersen's 2020 book,Evil Geniuses: The Unmaking of America.[124]His film,Presence, a haunted house thriller starringLucy LiuandJulia Fox, premiered at the2024 Sundance Film Festival.[125]Soderbergh filmed the upcoming spy thrillerBlack Bag, written byKimiandPresencescreenwriterDavid Koeppand starringCate BlanchettandMichael Fassbender,[126]from May to June 2024 in London.[127]He also produced the off-broadway playThe Fears, his first stage credit.[128]His next film,The Christophers, a dark comedy fromFull Circlewriter Solomon, starts filming in London in February 2025, starringIan McKellen,Michaela CoelandJames Corden.[129]
Soderbergh's visual style often emphasizes wealthy urban settings, natural lighting, and fast-paced working environments.[8][2][130]Film critic Drew Morton has categorized his stylistic approach to films akin to theFrench New Wavemovement in filmmaking.[131][132]Soderbergh's experimental style and tendency to rejectmainstream film standardsstems from his belief that "[filmmakers] are always, in essence, at the beginning of infinity... there is always another iteration... always will be."[133]
On a technical level, Soderbergh prefers sustainedclose-ups,tracking shots,jump cuts, experimental sequencing and frequently skipsestablishing shotsin favor of audio and alternative visuals.[8]Many of his films are noted for a milieu of suspense through the usage ofthird-personvantage points and a variety ofover-the-shoulder shots. In his filmContagion(2011), he used amulti-narrative "hyperlink cinema" style, first established withintheOcean'strilogy.[134]He is known for tracking aesthetic transitions with a variety ofcolored washes, most notably yellow to symbolize open, socially acceptable situations while blue washes typically symbolize illegal or socially illicit endeavors.[135]In line with these washes, Soderbergh is liberal in his usage ofmontagesas he believes that they are equally important story-telling as dialogue.[136]
Soderbergh is known for having a combative relationship withHollywoodand the standards ofstudio filmmaking.[2]Film criticRoger Eberthas commented in this stylistic antagonism, "Every once in a while, perhaps as an exercise in humility, Steven Soderbergh makes a truly inexplicable film... A film so amateurish that only the professionalism of some of the actors makes it watchable... It's the kind of film where you need the director telling you what he meant to do and what went wrong and how the actors screwed up and how there was no money for retakes, etc."[137]
InOcean's Twelve(2004), he had actressJulia Robertsplay the part of Tess, a character then forced to play a fictionalized version of Roberts.[138]During the production stages ofThe Girlfriend Experience(2009) he cast adult film starSasha Greyin the lead role.[138]InHaywire(2011), Soderbergh cast and eventually launched the film career of professionalmixed martial arts(MMA) fighterGina Carano.[139]Soderbergh'sLogan Lucky(2017) made reference to his trilogy by alluding to an "Ocean's7–11", noting the trilogy's influence on the Southern heist film.[138]
Soderbergh's films are centered on suspenseful and ambientsoundscapes.[140]A primary way he achieves suspenseful soundscapes is by introducing audio before visuals in cut scenes, alerting the viewer of a sudden change in tone.[140]His frequent collaborations with composersCliff Martinez,David Holmes, and most recentlyThomas Newman, provide his films with "the thematic and sonic landscapes into which he inserts his characters."[44]
The simplest way that I can describe it is that a movie is something you see, andcinemais something that's made…. Cinema is a specificity of vision. It's an approach in which everything matters. It's the polar opposite of generic or arbitrary and the result is as unique as a signature or a fingerprint. It isn't made by a committee, and it isn't made by a company, and it isn't made by the audience.
Soderbergh's early films—on account of his youth and lack of resources—were primarily filmed onSuper 8and16 mm filmformats.[142]A variety of his feature films have been shot using a diverse range of camera equipment. He filmed all ofThe Girlfriend Experience(2009) on aRed Onecamera, which has retailed for $17,500[143]—a relatively inexpensive camera for a movie produced for $1.3 million.[144]Soderbergh filmed the entirety ofUnsane(2018) on aniPhone 7 Pluswith its4K digital camerausing the app FiLMiC Pro.[145]He filmed with three rotating iPhones using aDJI stabiliserto hold the phone in place.[146]In January 2018, he expressed an interest in filming other productions solely with iPhones going forward.[147]He then filmed the entirety of 2019'sHigh Flying Birdon aniPhone 8.[148]
In addition to his directing, he is frequently a screenwriter for his films. Scott Tobias ofThe A. V. Clubhas noted his method ofexperimental filmmakingas "rigorously conceived, like a mathematician working out a byzantine equation". Starting in 2000 with his filmTraffic, when directing films Soderbergh has used various pseudonyms in order to hide the fact that he edits, writes, and arranges.[149]
When working with actors, Soderbergh prefers to pursue a non-intrusive directorial style. "I try and make sure they're OK, and when they're in the zone, I leave them alone. I don't get in their way".[150]This method has attracted repeat performances by many high-profile movie stars which has established a reoccurring collaboration between them and Soderbergh.[150]
Soderbergh's films often center the themes of shiftingpersonal identities,sexuality, and thehuman condition.[151]Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkerstated that Soderbergh is focused on the process of presenting ideas through film rather than their actual realization.[151]In line with this actual realization, he presents themes to critically evaluate political and corporate institutions such as money andcapitalism.[152]Film criticA. O. Scotthas noted that Soderbergh has a critical interest in exploring the impact capitalist economies have on living an ethical life and the detractions associated withmaterialism.[153]Money is central to many of his movies as Soderbergh believes that it serves as an obsession unrivaled by any other.[153]
Starting withOut of Sight(1998), Soderbergh's heist films explore themes of vengeance, characters on a mission, and the morality of crime.[154]He is generally said to have acinematic nichein these types of films. "I've always had an attraction to caper movies, and certainly there are analogies to making a film. You have to put the right crew together, and if you lose, you go to movie jail", the director noted in 2017.[155]
When asked about the top eleven films he regarded among the best, Soderbergh listed the following, in order:The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.(1953),All The President's Men(1976),Annie Hall(1977),Citizen Kane(1941),The Conversation(1974),The Godfather(1972),The Godfather Part II(1974),Jaws(1975),The Last Picture Show(1971),Sunset Boulevard(1950) andThe Third Man(1949).[156]His directorial debut,Sex, Lies, and Videotape(1989), was influenced byMike Nichols' 1971 American comedy-dramaCarnal Knowledge.[157]He has said thatPeter Yates' 1972 crime-comedyThe Hot Rockinspired the tone of theOcean'sfilms.[158]Soderbergh listedCosta-Gavras's film,Zas an inspiration on his filmTrafficand even stated that he: "wanted to make it like [Costa-Gavras]'sZ".[159][160][161][162]Soderbergh also cites the Swiss-French directorJean-Luc Godardas "...a constant source of inspiration. Before I do anything, I go back and look at as many of his films as I can, as a reminder of what's possible".[163]
In 2018, Soderbergh launched aBoliviangrape spirit brand called "Singani 63". In 2014, he had teamed up with adistillerybased inTarija, Casa Real and became the sole exporter of the spirit from the mountains of Bolivia.[164][165]Singaniis a traditional spirit of Bolivia, and Soderbergh doesn't like to label singani abrandy, because he says, "Millennials hate brandy." To demonstrate this, he created a very short iPhone/YouTube video, "Brandy VS Singani 63", that asks people to give their thoughts regarding brandy and Singani 63.[166]
Soderbergh has worked with various actors, composers, and screenwriters throughout his filmmaking career. His most prolific collaborators are considered to beGeorge Clooney(who startedSection Eight Productionswith him and has appeared in six of his films),Matt Damon(his most frequent collaborator, who has appeared in nine of his films),Brad Pitt,Julia Roberts,Don Cheadle, andChanning Tatum. Other actors who have appeared in numerous Soderbergh films includeLuis Guzmán,Jude Law,Ann Dowd,Joe Chrest,[167]Benicio Del Toro,Catherine Zeta-Jones,Michael DouglasandAlbert Finney.[168]Among those who have won awards for their work with Soderbergh, Roberts won anAcademy Award for Best Actressfor her lead inErin Brockovich;Benicio del Toroalso won an Academy Award for his work inTraffic, and later starred as the title role inChe.Catherine Zeta-Jonesreceived aGolden Globenomination for her portrayal of Helena inTrafficand reteamed with him forOcean's TwelveandSide Effects.[168]
Soderbergh has frequently relied onJerry Weintraubto produce many of his films.[169]ComposerCliff Martinezhas scored eleven Soderbergh films starting withSex, Lies, and Videotape(1989) and ending withKimi(2022). Northern Irish composerDavid Holmesjoined him in 1998 to scoreOut of Sightand rejoined him in scoring hisOcean'strilogy.[170]Soderbergh rejected Holmes' score for his 2006 filmThe Good German, but brought him back for subsequent movies, most recentlyLogan Lucky(2017).[170][171]Starting in 2000, composerThomas Newmanhas worked with four Soderbergh films, most recently in 2020 withLet Them All Talk.[172]Often editing the films himself, he also works with editorStephen Mirrioneand frequently collaborates with screenwritersScott Z. Burns,Lem DobbsandEd Solomon.[173]
Soderbergh is a vocal proponent of the preservation of artistic merit in the face of Hollywood corporatism. He believes that "cinemais under assault by the studios and, from what I can tell, with the full support of the audience".[151]He claims that he no longer reads reviews of his movies. "AfterTrafficI just stopped completely", said the director.[174]"After winning the LA and New York film critics awards, I really felt like, this can only get worse".[174]
Soderbergh is not a fan ofpossessory credits, and prefers not to have his name front and center at the start of a film. "The fact that I'm not an identifiable brand is very freeing," says Soderbergh, "because people get tired of brands and they switch brands. I've never had a desire to be out in front of anything, which is why I don't take a possessory credit."[174]He often takes cinematography credits on his feature films under the alias Peter Andrews, the given name of his father, and editing credits under Mary Ann Bernard, that of his mother.
In 2009, Soderbergh appeared before theU.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and "cited the French initiative in asking lawmakers to deputize the American film industry to pursue copyright pirates," indicating he supports anti-piracy laws and Internet regulation.[175]
Soderbergh married actressBetsy Brantleyin 1989; the couple had a daughter together before their 1994 divorce.[19]He has been married toJules Asnersince 2003, whom he often credits for influencing his female characters.[176]He has a daughter, born in 2010, with a woman in Australia, where he was working during a separation from Asner.[177]Soderbergh lives in New York City.[178]His 2023 web seriesCommand Zwas filmed inside his own home.[179]
In 2009, Soderbergh signed a petition in support of film directorRoman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his1977 sexual abuse case.[180]
Soderbergh's entire filmography isroutinely analyzed and debatedby fans, critics,film academics, and other film directors.[141][181]His early work—particularly his 1989 film,Sex, Lies, and Videotape—has been noted as foundational to theIndependent Cinemamovement.[25][182][183]After directing his first film, Soderbergh's relative youth and sudden rise to prominence in the film industry had him referred to as a "sensation", aprodigy, and aposter boyof the genre's generation.[13][14]In 2002, he was elected first Vice President of theDirectors Guild of America.[184]
After screeningSex, Lies, and Videotapeat the 1989Cannes Film Festival, Soderbergh was given the festival's top award, thePalme d'Or.[8]At 26, he was the youngest solo director to win the award and second-youngest director after French directorsLouis Malleand co-directorJacques Cousteau(Malle won it aged 23).[9]For his script, Soderbergh received a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplayat the62nd Academy Awards.[185]
Soderbergh was nominated twice forBest Directorfor two separate films at the73rd Academy Awards, the first occurrence of such an event since 1938. Apart from his first nomination (Erin Brockovich), he won the award forTraffic.[37]When the same thing happened at theDirectors Guild of AmericaAwards, theAssociated Presscalled the category a "Soderbergh vs. Soderbergh" contest.[36]
For his work ofErin BrockovichandTraffic, Soderbergh became one of the five directors (alongsideQuentin Tarantino,Curtis Hanson,David Fincher, andBarry Jenkins) to ever sweep "The Big Four" critics awards (LAFCA,NBR,NYFCC,NSFC).
