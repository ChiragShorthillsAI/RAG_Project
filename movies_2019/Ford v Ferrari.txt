Ford v Ferrari(titledLe Mans '66in some European countries)[4]is a 2019 Americanbiographicalsports drama filmdirected byJames Mangoldand written byJez Butterworth,John-Henry Butterworth, andJason Keller. It starsMatt DamonandChristian Bale, withJon Bernthal,Caitríona Balfe,Tracy Letts,Josh Lucas,Noah Jupe,Remo Girone, andRay McKinnonin supporting roles. The plot follows a determined team of American and English engineers and designers, led by automotive designerCarroll Shelbyand his English driver,Ken Miles, who are hired byHenry Ford IIandLee Iacoccato build a race car to defeat the perennially dominant Italian racing teamScuderia Ferrariat the1966 24 Hours of Le Mansrace in France.
Ford v Ferrarihad its world premiere at theTelluride Film Festivalon August 30, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 15, 2019, by20th Century Fox. Critics praised the performances (particularly Bale and Damon), Mangold's direction, the editing, the sound design and the racing sequences. It was chosen by theNational Board of Reviewas one of the ten best films of the year, and at the92nd Academy Awardsreceived four nominations, includingBest Picture, and wonBest Film EditingandBest Sound Editing.[5][6]Bale also received nominations for theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Dramaand theScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role.[7][8]
In 1963,Ford Motor CompanyVice PresidentLee Iacoccaproposes toHenry Ford IIto boost their car sales by purchasingFerrari, dominant in the24 Hours of Le Mans. OwnerEnzo Ferrariuses Ford's offer to secure a deal withFiatthat allows him to retain ownership of the firm's racing team,Scuderia Ferrari, and insults Ford and his whole company. This leads Ford into ordering his racing division to build a car to compete against Ferrari at Le Mans, and Iacocca hiringShelby AmericanownerCarroll Shelby, a retired driver who wonLe Mans in 1959. Shelby enlists his friendKen Miles, a hot-tempered English racing driver and mechanical engineer.
Shelby and Miles develop the UK-builtFord GT40 Mk Iprototype atLos Angeles International Airport. At the launch of the newFord Mustang, Miles gives a witheringly rude appraisal of it to Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe. Beebe campaigns against sending Miles to theupcoming race at Le Mansas a public relations liability. Shelby reluctantly excludes Miles and sendsPhil HillandBruce McLarento Le Mans; none of the Fords finish.
When Ford demands why he should not sack Shelby, Shelby explains that despite the GT40's reliability problems, it instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari by reaching 218 mph (350.8km/h), on theMulsanne Straightbefore breaking down. He says a race car cannot be designed by committee. Ford tells him to continue the project and report directly to him. During testing of theGT40 Mk II, the recurrent problem ofbrake fadecauses a crash and fire, which Miles survives. The team realizes the rules permit replacing the whole brake assembly during the race.
In 1966, Beebe takes over the racing division. When he and Ford arrive to inspect the program, Shelby locks Beebe in his office and gives Ford a ride in the GT40. Shelby makes an agreement with Ford: if Miles wins the24 Hours of Daytona, then he will race at Le Mans. If not, Ford will take full ownership of Shelby American. AtDaytona International Speedway, Beebe enters a second GT40 supported by aNASCARteam with quicker pit stops. However, Shelby clears Miles to push his car beyond the 7,000RPMredline, and he wins.
At thenext race at Le Mans, Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap. The pit crew fixes it and Miles sets lap records, catching the Ferraris. The GT40 suffers brake fade while dicing with the prototype330 P3Ferrari ofLorenzo Bandini, so Miles limps into the pits for replacement of the entire braking system. Ferrari protests but Shelby assures race officials it is legal.
Miles and Bandini duel on the Mulsanne Straight until the Ferrari breaks down, putting Bandini out of the race. With Fords in the top three positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other Fords to catch him and give the press a three-carphoto finish. Shelby tells Miles what Beebe wants but says it is Miles's call. Miles initially continues to set new lap records, but decides to comply on the final lap.
McLaren is declared the winner as, having started behind Miles, his car traveled farther overall. Miles is placed second. Shelby accuses Beebe of deliberately costing Miles the win, but an unusually sanguine Miles lets it pass, saying to Shelby, "You promised me the drive, not the win." From his vantage point, Enzo Ferrari tips his hat to Miles on the track. As they walk off together, Shelby tells Miles they will win Le Mans next time.
Two months later, during testing atRiverside International Raceway, a mechanical failure in theJ-carkills Miles in a crash. Six months later, Shelby parks outside Miles's widow Mollie's house and hesitates. Miles's son Peter arrives and the two talk about Miles. Shelby gives Peter a wrench that Miles once threw at him in anger.
A textual epilogue text reveals Ford continued its Le Mans winning streak in1967,1968, and1969, and Miles was posthumously inducted into theMotorsports Hall of Fame of Americain 2001.

Mick LaSalleofSan Francisco Chroniclegave the film four out of four stars, saying that it "is what it promises to be, a blast from the past" and writing: "Ford v Ferraricould have just been a sports story, dramatizing an interesting chapter in racing, and it would have been fine. But in showing Ford and his minions' constant interference in the dedicated work of Miles and Shelby, this James Mangold film becomes a tale of souls battling the soulless."[42]
Eric Kohn ofIndiewiregave the film a "B", saying that "Ford v Ferrariexcels at evoking the sheer thrill of the race—'a body moving through space and time', as one character says—and it's compelling enough in those moments to make the case that nothing beats the thrill of competition."[43]
Variety's Peter DeBruge praised the racing sequences and the performances of Bale and Damon, writing: "The best sports movies aren't so much about the sport as they are the personalities, and these two go big with their performances."[44]

Mangold has mentioned that, in all of his works, he always tries to find an emotional center within his stories he can operate from, especially when he does franchise films due to contemporary culture having made franchises a commodity to the point of being repetitive, commenting "it makes an audience wish that they just had the first one over again. So you have to push something to someplace new, while also remembering the core reasons why everyone was gathered" to make the best story with those issues at its heart, being the approach he employed forLoganandIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.[42]
In regards to adapting material, Mangold described that in regards to abiographical film, he can interpret the known quantities as he sees better like he did inA Complete Unknown, but the process is more difficult with a big and existing franchise orIPlike theSwamp Thing, as he knows the "religious level" the property'sfansmay reach like theDC Comicsones in regards to how he adapts such franchise's lore, thus resulting on him focusing on what he wishes to do for hisDC Universe(DCU) film even if his decisions bother fans due to not letting himself be "handcuffed" by a franchise's lore due to being impossible to please everybody.[43]He does have a dislike formultiversesand multi-movie universe-building despite his work on theX-Menfilm series, deeming them as the "enemy and death" of storytelling due to audiences caring more for "the way theLegosconnect" over how the story works, which should in an emotional level instead of "intellectually" throughEaster eggs.[44]
Mangold cites one of the benefits of working in differentfilm genresis that he has the ability to decide what works in each of his films, describing that "part of the joy" is that he learns a lot when changing genres or the vernacular in some of the way he communicates in his art, whether he makes anaction film, aWestern, asuperhero filmor aMarvel Comicsfilm, allowing himself to carry over the lessons he learned in one genre to another one that people may not expect, like he did inLogan, which is a superhero film with themes, visual motifs and plenty of references to the Western.[43]
