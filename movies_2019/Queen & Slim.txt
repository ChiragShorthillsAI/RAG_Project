Queen & Slimhad its world premiere at theAFI Feston November 14, 2019, and was theatrically released in theUnited Stateson November 27, 2019, byUniversal Pictures. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Kaluuya and Turner-Smith's lead performances, Matsoukas' direction and its overall theme and message. It grossed $47 million on a $20 million budget.
In 2019, after a client of hers is executed by the state, "Queen", a black criminal defense attorney, has an awkward and disappointing dinner with herTinderdate "Slim" in anOhiodiner. As he drives her home from what will be their one and only date, they are pulled over by a white police officer who searches Slim and his trunk without cause. When Slim mildly asks the officer to hurry as it is cold outside, the officer draws his gun on Slim. Queen angrily gets out to confront the officer, reaching for her phone, and he shoots her in the leg. Slim tackles the officer and a scuffle ensues, resulting in Slim grabbing the officer's gun and shooting him dead. Taking the gun and throwing away their phones, Queen tells Slim they must go on the run or else spend their lives in prison.
Out of gas, they flag down a passing Latino driver, Edgar, who turns out to be aKentuckysheriff. He receives anAPBabout the officer's death and realizes Queen and Slim are the suspects. They take his truck at gunpoint, leaving him in the trunk of Slim's car, despite his offering to help them. They pay a young black boy to order them food, and he reveals thatdashcamfootage of their confrontation with the officer has gone viral. They accidentally strike the boy's father with the truck, but he is supportive of their actions — the police officer Slim shot having killed an unarmed black man two years earlier — and they drive him to a hospital. Slim has an unsettling encounter with a gas station clerk after letting him hold the gun.
They arrive inNew Orleansat the house of Queen's estranged Uncle Earl, a pimp, and Slim proposes they escape toCuba. After a police officer notices their truck, Earl gives them money and another car to reach Johnny Shepherd, a friend whose life he saved while serving overseas. Queen and Slim bond while dancing at a bar, where they are recognized by sympathetic locals, and stop to admire a horse by the road. Their car breaks down, forcing them to give all their money to a black mechanic, whose teenage son Junior expresses his admiration for them; Slim has Junior take their picture.
Slim calls his father, who cuts the call short; it is revealed that law enforcement was listening in, but his father refuses to cooperate. Queen takes Slim to visit the grave of her mother, who was accidentally killed by her Uncle Earl during a disagreement; Queen successfully defended him in her first trial. Slim comforts Queen, and they have sex in the car. At a protest in support of the fugitives, Junior is urged to leave by a compassionate black officer, whom he impulsively shoots in the face, and is himself killed.
Queen and Slim reach the home of Shepherd and his wife, who reveal that a $500,000 bounty has been placed on them, and Shepherd gives them directions to a man inFlorida. A neighbor sees them arrive, and a SWAT team raids the house but fails to find them, hidden in a crawlspace under the Shepherds' bed. The next day, they sneak out of the house through a window and Queendislocates her shoulder, which Slim resets, but her cry alerts a black officer stationed outside. He discovers them about to flee in the Shepherds' car but lets them escape.
They reach the Florida address and sleep in the car, awakened in the morning by a black man with a shotgun. They follow the man to his trailer where he makes a call, telling them a friend can help them escape by plane. He drives them to the tarmac and Queen and Slim walk toward a waiting plane, but a squad of police cars arrives on the scene. Joining hands, they declare their love for each other, but Queen is shot dead by an overeager officer. Ignoring police commands, an unarmed Slim carries Queen's body toward the officers and is gunned down as well.
The people Queen and Slim encountered react to news reports of their deaths; the Florida man has collected the bounty, while the police have falsely claimed that both Queen and Slim were armed when they were shot, despite footage showing the opposite. Their real names are revealed to be Angela Johnson and Ernest Hines, and hundreds attend their funeral, viewing them asmartyrsas Junior's photo of them becomes a symbol across the country.

In 2019, he published a memoir of his early life,Acid for the Children.
Michael Peter Balzary was born on October 16, 1962, inMelbourne,Victoria, Australia. He is of partialHungarianandIrishdescent. His father, Mick Balzary, an avid fisherman, often took him fishing.[1]When Flea was four, his family moved toRye,New York, for his father's career. In 1971, his parents divorced, and his father returned to Australia. Flea and his sister Karyn stayed with their mother Patricia, who subsequently married jazz musician Walter Urban (1941–2011).[2]
Flea's stepfather frequently invited musicians to his house forjam sessions. The family moved toLos Angeles,California, where Flea became fascinated by thetrumpet.[3][4]He attended private lessons taught byJane Sager.[5]He had no interest in rock music at the time, instead idolizing jazz musicians likeMiles Davis,Louis Armstrong, andDizzy Gillespie.[3]Flea described his childhood home as violent; his stepfather was an aggressive alcoholic who eventually became involved in shootouts with police. Flea said: "I grew up being terrified of my parents, particularly my father figures. It caused [me] a lot of trouble later in life."[6]To cope, Flea began smokingcannabisat 13, and became a daily user.[7]
He was first called "Flea" as a teenager for his seeming inability to sit still, and the nickname stuck.[8]Nicknamed Mike B. the Flea, he attendedFairfax High School, and was something of an outcast due to his taste in music.[7]However, he soon metAnthony Kiedis, and after a brief confrontation, the two became best friends.[9]Kiedis recalled: "We were drawn to each other by the forces of mischief and love and we became virtually inseparable. We were both social outcasts. We found each other and it turned out to be the longest-lasting friendship of my life."[10]
Flea was introduced to rock music byHillel Slovak, and particularlypunk rockby Kiedis. Flea learned to play bass from Slovak, who shortly after asked him to be a bassist in his band,Anthym. Flea soon developed his own style and joined the group, but quit several months later to play for the punk rock outfitFear. He then rejoined Slovak to form an intended one-off band: Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem along with Kiedis andJack Irons, all of them at the time inspired by thefree funkbandDefunktand thehip hopactGrandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.[11]
The band changed its name to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, playing several shows at L.A. venues.[12]Their repertoire grew to nine songs as a result of months of playing at local nightclubs and bars.[13]The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape produced by the then-drummer ofFearand subsequently secured a record deal withEMI.[14]Irons and Slovak, however, decided to leave the Red Hot Chili Peppers in order to pursue a "more serious" future with the rock bandWhat Is This?.[15]Flea ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would be lost without them. He and Kiedis hired drummerCliff Martinezand guitaristJack Shermanto fill Irons' and Slovak's place, respectively.[15]Andy Gill, formerly ofGang of Four, agreed to produce their first album. Gill and Sherman clashed with Flea and Kiedis; they continuously argued over music style, sound, and the album's production.[16]Flea himself felt that the album was stiff and "a big mistake", but also admitted, "we [he and Kiedis] were just disrespectful and obnoxious".[17]The band's debut album,The Red Hot Chili Peppers, was released on August 10, 1984, to largely poor critical and commercial review.[18]After a relatively unfruitful tour, Sherman was fired in early 1985. Slovak, who had been contemplating a return to the Chili Peppers, rejoined the group after being encouraged by Flea.[19]
Funk musicianGeorge Clintonwas hired to produce the band's second album,Freaky Styley(1985). The strong chemistry between Clinton and the Chili Peppers was felt instantly. Flea later referred to Clinton as "the warmest, kindest man in the world".[20]Freaky Styleywas released in August 1985. It received only a bit more attention thanThe Red Hot Chili Pepperswith roughly 75,000 copies sold by year's end.[17]Flea was somewhat indifferent to the poor album sales as he had recently proposed to girlfriend Loesha Zeviar, who was pregnant with their child.[21]The band hiredMichael Beinhorn, their last resort among potential producers, to work on their next album.[22]What Is This? had finally disbanded, and drummer Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid-1986 after Martinez was fired. Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained. Flea recalled that "it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy".[22]Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving Flea and Slovak to work on much of the album's material by themselves.
Kiedis was briefly kicked out of the band and given a month torehabilitate. Kiedis completed the rehab and returned with the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third albumThe Uplift Mofo Party Plan(1987).[22]Flea has referred to the album as "the 'rockingest' record" the band has ever made.[22]The Uplift Mofo Party Planproved to be far more successful, commercially and critically, than the Chili Peppers' preceding albums, registering at number 148 on theBillboard200.[23]Following theUplifttour, Slovak's drug use dramatically increased. Flea's relationship with Slovak faded, and Slovak became isolated and depressed.[17]On June 28, 1988, Slovak was found dead of a heroin overdose. Flea reflected: "I didn't really know how to deal with that sadness, and I don't think [Kiedis] knew how to deal with it either."[17]Irons, who was taking Slovak's death particularly hard, left the group.[14]
Flea and Kiedis took some time to collect themselves, but they kept the band together. GuitaristDeWayne "Blackbyrd" McKnightand drummerD.H. Peligrowere added, and the band entered the studio to record a new album. McKnight soon began to create tension within the group, as his style did not mesh with the rest of the band.[24]Peligro, the former drummer of the punk rock bandDead Kennedys, was a friend ofJohn Frusciante, an 18-year-old guitarist and avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan.[25]Peligro introduced Frusciante to Flea, and the trio jammed together on several occasions.[26]Flea was impressed with Frusciante's skill, and astonished by his knowledge of the Chili Peppers' repertoire. Flea realized that Frusciante could provide the spark McKnight was lacking.[27]McKnight was fired, and Frusciante accepted an invitation to join the band.[24]Peligro was fired shortly thereafter; the Chili Peppers brought in drummerChad Smithas his replacement.[28]
Flea and his wife Loesha started to grow apart, and he began trying to recreate the memories of his adolescence by smoking marijuana on a daily basis.[26]The Chili Peppers entered the studio, and completed recording of their fourth album,Mother's Milk, in early 1989. Upon release, the album was met with mixed reactions from critics, but received far more commercial attention, peaking at number 52 on theBillboard200.[23]After this, Flea made appearances playing the trumpet on Jane's Addiction's 1988 albumNothing's Shocking,[29]and bass on the critically acclaimed 1989Young MCalbumStone Cold Rhymin'. He would also appear in the video for "Bust a Move", the hit single from the same album.[30]
TheMother's Milk Tourput further strain on Flea's marriage. In order to make money, he needed to tour, and therefore spent time away from his family.[31]Furthermore, he and Smith were arrested on charges of battery and sexual harassment after a performance onMTV's coverage of spring break;[17]charges were eventually dropped.[31]The band was, however, attracting over three thousand people per show;Mother's Milkhad beencertifiedas agoldrecord in early 1990.[32][33]By the time Red Hot Chili Peppers returned to Los Angeles, Flea and Loesha agreed to a separation.[31]He tried to put the separation out of his mind by smoking marijuana and having sex with randomgroupies, when the band was on tour forMother's Milk.[31]
When the successful Mother's Milk tour was over, the Red Hot Chili Peppers severed ties with EMI and signed instead withWarner Bros. Records.[34]Rick Rubin, who had rejected an opportunity to produceThe Uplift Mofo Party Plan, agreed to produce their next album.[35]Flea had largely used the principalslap basstechnique on the band's preceding four albums, and decided to downplay this style in favor of more conventional, melodic bass lines.[36]To record the album, Rubin suggested they use a mansion that once belonged to magicianHarry Houdini. Flea felt it was "a creatively fertile situation", and decided to bring his daughter Clara with him.[35]He and the rest of the band, excluding Smith, remained inside the house for the entire recording process. When not writing or recording the album, Flea spent a large portion of his time with Frusciante smoking large quantities of marijuana.[35]The emotions Flea felt during the album's recording were like nothing he had ever experienced:[17]
When we [the band] madeBlood Sugar Sex Magikwe spent a lot of time jamming—every day, for hours and hours. I remember during that time Anthony went off and made a movie, and for a long time it was just me, John and Chad, and we'd just go in there and play. Me and John were hitting the bong and we just rocked and grooved forever. It was the first time we went in to make a record where there wasn't this feeling of being sort of intimidated by what was going to happen.
WhenBlood Sugar Sex Magikwas released on September 24, 1991, it received an extremely positive critical response. The album peaked at number three on theBillboardHot 200, and went on to sell over 7,000,000 copies in the U.S. alone.[19][23]The album's ensuing tour was critically acclaimed—the Chili Peppers commonly performed shows with over 20,000 in attendance.[37]Seattle-basedgrungebandNirvanaalso toured with them during the West Coast leg of their United States tour.[37]The massive attention the Chili Peppers started receiving, however, caused Frusciante to feel extremely uncomfortable, and he abruptly quit the band during the Japanese leg of the album's tour,[38]replaced temporarily by Arik Marshall. Following the tour in 1993, Flea was diagnosed withmyalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome(ME/CFS) and was ordered to rest for a year.[39]
On October 30, 1993, Flea was playing atThe Viper Roomwith the bandPwhen his close friendRiver Phoenixwas outside the venue having seizures as the result of an overdose. When this news filtered through the club, Flea rushed outside and accompanied Phoenix in the ambulance that took him to Cedars-Sinai Hospital.[40]
Flea and Kiedis felt it best to fire Marshall due to lack of chemistry and briefly replaced him withJesse Tobias, although his tenure was very short and he was quickly replaced byJane's AddictionguitaristDave Navarro, who was once recruited in 1992 to replace Frusciante. The band was ready now to record their next album although Kiedis was in the middle of a heroin relapse, which forced Flea to assume the role of lyricist, something he had not yet done. He wrote most of the song "Transcending", and the intro and outro to "Deep Kick". Flea also wrote the entire lyric to a song, "Pea", in which he both played bass and sang.[41]These three songs appeared on the Chili Peppers' sixth recordOne Hot Minute, which was released on September 12, 1995. The album received mixed reviews and was significantly less commercially successful thanBlood Sugar Sex Magik.[19]TheOne Hot Minute Tourwas ultimately cut short due to various injuries Kiedis and Smith received, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers decided to go on hiatus. Flea was so miserable that at one point during the tour he discussed quitting the band.[42]Flea began to practiceTranscendental Meditation[43][44]andyoga, and slowly decreased his marijuana consumption.[42]Due to the Chili Peppers' inactivity, Flea joined Navarro in a Jane's Addiction reunion tour in 1997, filling in for ex-Jane's Addiction bassistEric Avery. Rumors spread, that the band was breaking up until Navarro stated otherwise: "I want to clarify that the Chili Peppers are not breaking up ... Flea and I are more than happy to do both projects, time permitting."[42]
Flea also had plans to record a solo album. He asked Chili Peppers managerLindy Goetzto help him promote the record and his future solo career.[42]Flea eventually abandoned the idea in favor of offering his bass services to other artists. He performed on over forty records from 1995 to 1998, ranging fromAlanis Morissette'sJagged Little Pill(with Navarro) to formerMinutemenbassistMike Watt's debut solo albumBall-Hog or Tugboat?. He also worked withTori AmosandMichael Stipeon a track for the soundtrack to the 1995Johnny DeppfilmDon Juan DeMarco.[45]Navarro was fired from the Chili Peppers in 1998, and Flea questioned whether or not the Red Hot Chili Peppers would stay together: "... the only way I could imagine carrying on is if we got John [Frusciante] back in the band."[46]Frusciante had completed drug rehabilitation in 1997 after a severe addiction to heroin andcrack cocaineleft him on the brink of death.[47]Flea visited Frusciante in early 1998, inviting him back to the Chili Peppers; an emotional Frusciante readily accepted.[48]
With Frusciante back on guitar, the band began writing new songs during the summer of 1998 in Flea's garage.[17]He and Kiedis were less confident in writing the album after the disappointing results ofOne Hot Minute.[17]Flea had also recently broken up with his girlfriend of two years, Marissa Pouw, causing him to enter a state of depression[49]which was only lifted when his daughter, Clara who was 10 years old, comforted him after several weeks of crying.[17]
Flea was heavily influenced byelectronicaduring the writing and recording ofCalifornication(1999) and he attempted to emulate this when writing bass lines for the album.[49]Californicationtook less than two weeks to record; by contrast,One Hot Minutetook over a year. WhenCalifornicationwas released on June 8, 1999, it received overwhelmingly positive critical reviews and sold fifteen million copies worldwide—more thanBlood Sugar Sex Magik.[17]The Chili Peppers playedWoodstock 1999, with Flea playing completely naked—something he would do again at theReading and Leeds Festivalsthe same year as well as several otherCalifornicationtour concerts.[49]
Red Hot Chili Peppers spent most of 2001 writing their eighth studio album,By the Way(2002). The band began listening to more melodic, textured music, that would reflect heavily on the album.[17]Frusciante became the driving force behindBy the Way, causing initial strife between him and Flea.[49]If he introduced a funk rhythm into his bass lines Frusciante would consequently disapprove to the point where Flea almost quit the band because he felt his role was no longer important.[49]By the Waywas released on July 9, 2002, to positive reviews, and went on to sell over nine million copies worldwide.[50]The ensuing tour was extremely profitable; the Chili Peppers performed three concerts in London'sHyde Parkto over 250,000 attendees and a total gross accumulation of US$17.1 million.[51]It became the highest-grossing concert at a single venue in history.[51]
After another two-year world tour, the Chili Peppers wrote their ninth studio album,Stadium Arcadium(2006).[52]UnlikeBy the Way, both Flea and Frusciante were more musically conjoined, when writing the record. They found inspiration inJimi Hendrix,Jimmy Page, andEddie Van Halenamong others.[53]The double album was ultimately released on May 9, 2006, to generally positive reviews, selling over seven million copies in less than two years.[54]In November 2007, Flea's $4.8 million Corral Canyon home inMalibuwas burnt down by a wildfire.[55]The location was not, however, his primary residence[55]and at the time of its destruction was being rented to musician and producerButch Walker.[56]
After the Chili Peppers announced a long hiatus due to exhaustion, Flea enrolled in music classes at theUniversity of Southern California, where he studiedmusic theory, composition and jazz trumpet. Flea attributed his interest to a newfound desire to widen his appreciation and understanding of music: "It's so much fun to learn this stuff because I never knew anything. I played trumpet in the school bands. I learned things I liked to play on my trumpet but I didn't learn why this note goes with this note and why it produces that sound. Or how to create tension in the composition [...] Knowing the structure is really fun."[57]Flea said he planned to release a mainly instrumental solo record, recorded in his home; guest musicians would includePatti Smithand a choir from the Silverlake Conservatory.[57]
In 2009, Flea joinedAtoms for Peace, a supergroup formed by theRadioheadsingerThom Yorketo perform songs from Yorke's debut solo album,The Eraser(2006).[58]Flea and the band recreated Yorke's electronic music with live instrumentation.[59]They toured the United States in 2010,[60][61]and released an album,Amok, in 2013.[59]Amokwas followed that year by a tour of Europe, the US and Japan.[62]
The Chili Peppers ended their hiatus in October 2009 without Frusciante, who quit the band to pursue other musical interests. He was replaced byJosh Klinghoffer.[63][64]The Red Hot Chili Peppers released their tenth studio album,I'm with You, on August 29, 2011. Also that year, Flea played bass on two songs onTom Waits' albumBad as Me, released on October 21.[65]On October 27, 2011, it was announced that Flea's project withDamon Albarnand afrobeat drummerTony Allenwould be calledRocket Juice & the Moon.[66]The band made their live debut on October 29, 2011, in London,[66]and released an album on March 12, 2012.[67]
In a June 23, 2011, interview, Flea discussed the band's return and how he almost quit the Chili Peppers during their hiatus. Flea said that he wanted to take two years away to see if the band was "something we should still be doing. . . . Things had gotten dysfunctional and not fun, even though I thought we were making great records, doing great shows and were a really powerful, mighty thing as a band. I was proud of what we did. . . . For me, the biggest thing during the time off, and what really made me want to continue doing the band, specifically after [he] decided he didn't want to continue in the band anymore, [was] I just realized, Anthony, man, he's my brother, I love him so much, and we started this band when we were kids. I wanted to keep that going, I never want to let that go. Playing with him is something, even though I can do other things that are exciting and beautiful and I always will do those things and I'll always want to grow and do music outside of the band, the thing that we have is special to us and something that is blood."[68]
The Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Famein April 2012. Flea said: "It's always been easy for me to pooh-pooh these awards—the [Rock] Hall of Fame too. But I inductedMetallicaa couple of years ago, and it was really a beautiful thing to see as all these people were being inducted. It made me love it. I love halls of fame anyway—theBasketball Hall of Fame, theBaseball Hall of Fame. So I feel grateful for the recognition of what we have done and for the hope and potential of what we'll continue to do."[69]
On July 19, 2012, Flea released a solo EP,Helen Burns, composed mainly of instrumental tracks, except the title track (whichPatti Smithsang on) and "Lovelovelove", which features theSilverlake Conservatory of Music's kids and adults choir. It is Flea's first solo release, who has only released solo songs previously on soundtracks and other projects. Flea said of the EP "I am putting it out to raise money for the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, a community-based non-profit music school that I am an integral part of." The download of the EP is available at "a name your own price" on the Silverlake Conservatory website and was made available through all major digital outlets on August 9, 2012.[70]
On October 16, 2012, his 50th birthday, Flea gave an interview withCNNdiscussing the Chili Peppers and was asked if he plans to continue with them. Flea responded by saying "I love the Chili Peppers, and I would love to. If there's anything I know, it's every time you start making plans, you don't know what's going to come up next. Anything can happen. So I love being in the Chili Peppers and it's my home, and I've been doing it for more than half my life. Of course, during the course of doing it, there's been all kinds of ups and downs, and moments of extreme (positivity), floating on clouds of greatness, and times of just groveling, and misery, and uncertainty, and anger, and love and all those things. Like being in a family. I really can't predict. But I love being in it for now, and right now, about as far as I'm thinking is getting through this tour that we're doing, performing at the highest level possible, then hunkering down and writing another record."[71]
On April 9, 2014, it was revealed that Flea was working on a new musical project, the bandAntemasque, with former Mars Volta membersCedric Bixler-Zavala,Omar Rodríguez-López, and Dave Elitch. Two songs were released in early April though Flea has confirmed that he is not a member of the band and just recorded a few songs with them.[72][73]Antemasque released their self-titled debut album on July 15, 2014.
In February 2015, Flea posted photos to hisInstagrampage showing that he had broken his arm during a skiing trip. His injury delayed the recording of the Chili Peppers' eleventh studio album for six months. Production was expected to resume in mid-August according to Flea, who said on August 3 that he was healed enough to play bass again and continue recording.[74]The Chili Peppers released their eleventh studio album,The Getaway,on June 17, 2016. The band embarked on a151-date world tourwhich concluded in October 2017.
Flea released his long-awaitedmemoir,Acid for the Children, on November 5, 2019. Flea first began the writing process in April 2014. The original scope of the book was to chronicle Flea's unconventional childhood (including his move from a "normal" life in the New York suburbs to a "bohemian" lifestyle in Los Angeles with his jazz-playing stepfather), his adventures in the L.A. streets, his "sometimes complex friendship and collaboration" with Chili Peppers co-founder Anthony Kiedis and the overall "tumultuous creative journey" of the band, which formed in 1983.[75]
In December 2019, the Red Hot Chili Peppers announced that guitarist John Frusciante would be returning to replaceJosh Klinghoffer. The band then focused on preparations for making a new album, which they originally hoped to have released in 2020, along with performing on a few festival dates.[76]The Chili Peppers began working on their twelfth studio album in the summer of 2020; however, due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, there were delays in the writing and recording, with their 2020 tour dates being postponed until 2021.

Flea has been married twice and has three children. From 1988 to 1990, Flea was married toCanadianLoesha Zeviar (Loesha's name remains tattooed on Flea's chest). Their daughter, Clara Louise Zeviar Balzary, was born in 1988. Clara was featured in the band'sFunky Monksdocumentary. She also has appeared at many shows and, as a child, provided artwork for the band's T-shirts and promotional material.[100]She has also documented the band'sI'm With Youtour through photographs and videos. As an adult, Clara was in the short-lived band the Tints[101]and is also an artist and photographer, taking the promotional photographs forThe Getaway.[102][103]
Flea was engaged to modelFrankie Rayder, who was once namedGQmagazine's sexiest woman in the world. The couple never married, however they had a child together, Sunny Bebop Balzary, who was born in 2005.[104][105]The song "Hard to Concentrate" on the Chili Peppers' 2006 album,Stadium Arcadium, was written by Kiedis as a wedding proposal to Flea and Rayder.[106][107]Flea and Rayder since split up.
In 2019, Flea got married for a second time to fashion designerMelody Ehsani. Flea said of Ehsani, "My life has changed forever and I am eternally humble and grateful. The person who sees all of me and knows who I am. My wife @melodyehsani."[108]Ehsani gave birth to their son, Darius Booker Balzary, in 2022.[109]
Flea appeared in the 2011 documentaryThe Other F Word, where he discussed the joys of being a father. "It's funny how you always hear people saying that classic parent attitude of, 'I brought you into this world, I gave you life!' You know, it's just, I think, completely the opposite. My kids gave me life. They gave me a reason."[110]
In February 2018, Flea released anop-edthroughTimemagazine about theopioid crisisas well as his own personal history of drug addiction about which for most of his career he had been very private. Flea hoped that by exposing his past issues with substance abuse that his stories could possibly help others battling their own addictions and raise more awareness on the need for those in the medical community and the government to help those in need. "I've been around substance abuse since the day I was born. All the adults in my life regularly numbed themselves to ease their troubles, and alcohol or drugs were everywhere, always. I started smoking weed when I was eleven, and then proceeded to snort, shoot, pop, smoke, drop and dragon chase my way through my teens and twenties," Flea said. Flea finally kicked his addictions in 1993; however, he revealed that in 2014 when he broke his arm in a snowboard accident he nearly had setbacks due tooxycontinthat his doctor prescribed for him: "My doctor put me back together perfectly, and thanks to him I can still play bass with all my heart. But he also gave me a two-month supply of Oxycontin. The bottle said to take four each day. I was high as hell when I took those things. It not only quelled my physical pain, but all my emotions as well. I only took one a day, but I was not present for my kids, my creative spirit went into decline and I became depressed. I stopped taking them after a month, but I could have easily gotten another refill. Addiction is a cruel disease, and the medical community, together with the government, should offer help to all of those who need it."[111]
In a June 2023 interview with theLos Angeles Times, Flea discussed his views on religion saying "Yeah, I'm a praying guy. I pray in the morning when I get up, when I go to bed, when I eat. And when I do an interview, I'll just stop for a second — like, let me get out of the way and let go of everything." When asked who he was praying to Flea replied that he was praying "To God. I'm not religious in any way, but I kind of believe in God. And I try to live a life that honors my idea of what God is — like a divine energy." Flea said when he turned 30 he was living a crazy life and got really sick with chronic fatigue due to non-stop partying and drugs and it was through the discovery of a self-help book byJon Kabat-Zinnthat led him down this path.[112]
In 1990, Flea was arrested inDaytona Beach, Florida, and charged with battery, disorderly conduct, and solicitation to commit an unnatural and lascivious act, and Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith was charged with battery, after the two were accused of "attacking a woman" in the audience of one of their performances;[needs update][113]as reported by a ranger fromVolusia County:
Balzary and Smith jumped into the crowd. / Balzary picked up the woman and began to spin her around on his shoulders, while Smith pulled her bathing suit to one side and began to slap her bottom... / [Unnamed officials also] said Balzary got on top of the woman, asked her to perform a sex act, then began to simulate the act.[113]
The woman "apparently was picked from the audience at random", and "[a]fter [she] cried for help, the band was escorted away."[113]According to the same ranger, the victim "signed a complaint against the band members" (which resulted in the charges filed).[113][needs update]

I'm against em........ Melt em all down, turn em into sculptures; there is no need for them on earth. In many countries, the cops have no guns and they do perfectly fine. No civilians should be allowed to have guns. none. And I don't think the cops should have guns either. Change theconstitution".[116]Following the racially motivatedCharleston church shootingin June 2015, Flea again voiced his anger towards gun violence, saying: "You are kidding me. This is too much. Humans are an over rated species. Sick. God help us." and "The USA land where any sick madman can easily get a gun. disgusting, deplorable, unbelievable."[117]

She got your oil shit product all over her feet." Flea stated he can no longer surf there or take his daughter to the beach further saying "Some kid in the hood who made a mistake selling drugs will go to jail and have his life ruined but you, you evil lying scumbags will get away with a paltry fine that means nothing to you. You could have had a shut off valve but you saved cash there too. You are the worst kind of human beings, I am infuriated you disgust me."[120]

It was really an important thing for my life, it gave me something to hold onto, and it was an important access for me. Without music I would've gotten into a lot of trouble and there are a lot of kids like me out there. I just wanted to try to provide something like what I got."[127]On March 20, 2011, Flea ran theLos Angeles Marathonto raise money for the Silverlake Conservatory of Music throughCrowdrise.[128]Flea was also featured inRunner's Worldmagazine discussing his preparation for the race.[129]

Flea joinedBrad Pittduring theCOVID-19 pandemicto help contribute to a community food giveaway for the people ofWatts, Los Angeles, on July 31, 2020. "The community gives back to me. I like being a part of it, I like building bridges, I like making friends. When corona hit and I was sitting around and going to the beach and stuff, I did a lot of thinking about people who really might be struggling because they're not getting enough to eat and not making money during COVID times," Flea said.[133]
Flea is a devout fan of theLos Angeles Dodgers,Los Angeles Rams, and most notably theLos Angeles Lakers. Flea first held Lakers season tickets in 1988 and has often been spotted sitting courtside at Lakers games with some of his bandmates.[citation needed]Two songs recorded for the 1989 albumMother's Milkwere tribute songs to Hall-of-Fame Lakers playersMagic JohnsonandKareem Abdul-Jabbar.[134]Flea performed the national anthem on April 13, 2016, in honor ofKobe Bryant's final game with the team before his retirement.[135][136]Following the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, Flea and the Chili Peppers performed an impromptu pregame show for fans at theLos Angeles Memorial Coliseum.[137][138][139]Upon the team's return to Los Angeles, Flea and Chad Smith have both owned season tickets since 2016.[140]

One notable rendition was before NBA superstarKobe Bryant's final game against theUtah Jazz, on April 13, 2016.[141]
He is also known to be a fan of English football teamSheffield United.[142]
Flea has employed a wide variety of basses over his career with some varying exclusivity, such asMusic Man, Modulus, his own brand Fleabass, and Fender Jazz and Precisions.[143]
Currently, his main stage bass is aCustom ShopFender Jazz Bass, modified with aModulusLane Poor pickup and Aguilar OBP-1 preamp, largely identical to the Modulus basses he previously used.[144]Fender has released this bass for sale as the Flea Signature Active Jazz Bass (no longer in production as of 2020),[145]in addition to a signature instrument modeled after his 1961 Fender Jazz Bass (which has been his primary studio bass since 2006);[146]Flea treasures his 1961 Jazz Bass for its "old wood sound".[147]
According to the Flea Bass Rig (Part 1)[148]video he used the following over the years in order of appearance.
Flea toured theCalifornication, 2001,By The Way,Roll on the Red,Stadium Arcadium,I'm With You, and2013–2014tours with his signatureModulusFlea basses (later renamed Modulus Funk Unlimited after the endorsement). Available in 4- and 5-string versions, Flea was seen with several designs over this time.
In 2009, Flea founded the Fleabass company with the goal to create quality budget basses for beginners. Whilst Flea did not perform with his own Fleabass production model he did however use a custom model created by UK artistDamien Hirst.
Damien actually made me a bass, a butterfly bass, it's a beautiful thing. It's not just a piece of art to hang on a wall. The whole new album I play on it. This bass is kind of heavy for live—I don't play Fenders that much live—but it's beautiful.[151]
The custom Fleabass was built with Lane Poor active pickups, Graphite neck, and 18-volt Aguliar OBP-1 preamp. It can be seen in the music videos forThe Getawayalbum.
Fifty of these basses were created. They were auctioned for Flea'sSilverlake Conservatory of Music, with a list price of £50,000.
InThe Getawayand2022–2024 Global Stadiumtours, Flea used four Custom Shop Fender Jazz basses.
These basses have a Jazz Bass style body, Lane Poor Legacy pickup, 18-volt Aguilar OBP-1 preamp, and a 22-fret graphite-reinforced neck created byFender Custom Shopmaster builder Jason Smith. The Brown Jazz is Fleas' current main tour bass, replacing his Modulus basses in the process.

In the2022–2023 Global Stadium Tour, he usedAmpeg SVTs.[161]
Flea has displayed a wide variety of techniques throughout the years, ranging from his initial use ofslapping and poppingto the more traditional methods he has employed sinceBlood Sugar Sex Magik. Greg Prato ofAllmusicwrote that "by combining funk-style bass with psychedelic, punk, and hard rock, Flea created an original playing style that has been copied numerous times". Flea stated in an interview, that he was influenced greatly byLouis Armstrong.[4]Flea has been considered one of the greatest bassists of all time, with Greg Tate ofRolling Stonesaying "if there were a Most Valuable Bass Player award given out in rock, Flea could have laid claim to that bitch ten years running".[162]Smashing Pumpkinsfront manBilly Corganrecalls, that when he first saw the Chili Peppers in 1984, "Flea was playing so aggressively that he had worn a hole in his thumb and he was literally screaming in pain in-between songs because it hurt so bad. Someone kept coming out and pouring crazy glue into the hole."[14]Flea's sound is also determined by what type of instrument he plays. BeforeCalifornication, he did not believe the actual bass held much significance: "what mattered was how you hit them [basses] and your emotional intent, and I still think that's the bottom line."[147]
Any instrument is just a vehicle to express who you are and your relationship to the world. No matter what level you're doing it on, playing music is an opportunity to give something to the world.
Flea's bass playing has changed considerably throughout the years. When he joinedFear, his technique centered largely onpunk rockbass lines;[163]however, he was to change this style when the Red Hot Chili Peppers formed. He began to incorporate a "slap" bass style that drew influence largely fromBootsy Collins.[15]However, this technique caused Flea to receive attention from the music world and was often copied, and he, therefore, felt it necessary to almost completely remove slap-bass styles from his repertoire followingMother's Milk(1989).[4]Consequently,Blood Sugar Sex Magik(1991) saw a notable shift in style as it featured less of his signature technique and more styles that focused on traditional and melodic roots.[164]His intellectual beliefs on how to play the instrument were also altered: "I was trying to play simply onBlood Sugar Sex Magikbecause I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to chill out and play half as many notes'. When you play less, it's more exciting—there's more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good."[164]
During the writing and recording ofOne Hot Minute(1995), Flea integrated some use of slap-bass progressions, but continued to apply the philosophy of "less is more" to his technique rather than courting complexity: "I can't even think of anything I played that was complex [on the record]; even the slapping stuff is simple. It's original-sounding, and I'm proud of that—but what I played was more a matter of aesthetic choice."[164]This led Flea to alter the way he wrote music by playing alone, instead of thejam sessionsthat would dictate how the band conceived songs: "[One Hot Minute] is the least jam-oriented record we've made. I mean, we definitely jammed on the ideas, but there's only one groove on the whole album that came from a jam, 'Deep Kick'. The rest of it came from my sitting down with a guitar or bass."[164]
Flea became interested inelectronicaduring theCalifornication(1999) era and he attempted to emulate the same atmosphere given off by synthesizers into his bass playing: "I feel the most exciting music happening is electronica, without a doubt."[49]He ultimately decided against this, acknowledging that, aside from Frusciante, the band was not moving in the same direction.[49]
InBy the Way(2002), many of the bass-lines were entirely stripped of funk. Flea felt the chords Frusciante had written were not supportive of his typical technique; furthermore, he does not feel the musical direction of the record was specifically melodic, but instead "... a result of each one of us being who we are. The way we [the band] compose music is a very communal thing."[165]
Flea's stepfather was in abebopjazz band that frequently jammed in his presence, so he soon became fascinated with the trumpet.[4][14][17]Flea credits his continued interest in music to jazz performers likeJaco Pastorius,Miles Davis,Duke Ellington,Charlie Parker,Louis Armstrong,John Coltrane, andDizzy Gillespie.[3]After Kiedis introduced him topunkand rock, Flea became infatuated with artists such asBlack Flag,David Bowie, andDefunkt.[10][17]Flea's early influences beforeBlood Sugar Sex Magikwere mainly funk artists. They would become a notable aspect of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound up toMother's Milk. Originally, Flea was given the impression by punk bands, that one should play as hard and fast as they possibly could, but ultimately rejected this philosophy duringBlood Sugar Sex Magik: "I was so into being raw [...] it was all bullshit."[147]OnCalifornicationandBy the Way, Flea drew influence from electronica,gothic rockbands likethe Cure,Joy DivisionandSiouxsie and the Bansheesandnew wave musicrather than funk.[114]Flea has also spoken highly ofNeil Young; he wrote an article forRolling Stonepraising Young for the consistent authenticity in his artistry, among other things.[166]
In 2009,Rolling Stone's readers ranked Flea the second-best bassist of all time, behindJohn Entwistleofthe Whoand ahead ofPaul McCartneyofthe Beatles.[167]In a 2010 poll conducted on theBBC TwoseriesI'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band!, Flea was named the bassist in the ultimate fantasy band alongsideFreddie Mercuryon vocals,Jimi Hendrixon guitar andJohn Bonhamon drums.[168]In April 2011, Flea was voted the second-best rock bassist in a poll conducted by Contact Music, behind Entwistle and ahead of McCartney,Geddy LeeofRushandLes ClaypoolofPrimus.[169]
