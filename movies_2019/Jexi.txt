Phil becomes enamored withcell phonesat an early age. He works for Chatterbox, aBuzzFeed-style website run by Kai. He pressures the staff to create inanelisticlestogo viral.
Despite Phil's degree in journalism, Kai refuses to promote him to the real news department. Phil's coworkers Craig and Elaine invite him to playkickball, but the socially inept Phil declines. Immersed in his phone, he walks into Cate, alocal bike shopowner. She attempts to flirt, but Phil is more concerned with his phone until another cyclist rides into him, breaking it.
Taking his mobile to be replaced, Phil is berated by phone store employee Denice for being overly reliant on his phone to navigate life. Setting up his new phone, Phil gives "Jexi", the device'svirtual assistant, access to all his accounts after neglecting to read theuser agreement. Designed to "make his life better", Jexi aggressively tries to break Phil out of his bad habits. Posing as him, she emails an insulting letter to Kai demanding a promotion.
Kai demotes Phil to the "comments section" with the older employees in the basement. When Craig and Elaine invite him to kickball again, he claims to be busy but Jexi embarrassingly corrects him. He joins them but costs the team the game; he invites everyone out for drinks, but they turn him down. Thinking about Cate, Phil looks up her bike shop, and Jexi calls the store despite his protests, preventing him from hanging up. He stumbles through an awkward conversation with her, gaining Jexi's sympathy.
Phil sees Cate at a coffee shop; she gives him her phone number and agrees to go on a date. At kickball, he plays tremendously, winning the game and bonding with his coworkers over their shared love ofDays of Thunder. Phil thanks Jexi for helping make life changes, but his date with Cate goes poorly, exacerbated by Jexi's interruptions. Cate tells Phil he is paying more attention to his phone than to her, and he admits he really likes her. So, she decides to continue the date, and they go biking until he crashes. They part ways, and Phil argues with Jexi, almost throwing his phone away.
Cate asks Phil to a concert, texting him arisque picture. He decides to respond with adick pic, taking multiple shots against Jexi's advice. She refuses to send any of them, and Cate thanks Phil for not sending a dick pic. Kai promotes Phil after a news writer suffers a freak accident. Leaving for the concert, Cate insists he leave his phone at home, much to Jexi's dismay. After sneaking backstage and partying withKid Cudi, Cate and Phil have sex. When he returns home, a jealous Jexi decides to ruin his life.
Phil is fired the next day after Jexi sends his dick pics to the entire company. He visits Cate to discover her ex-fiancée Brody is back in town, and breaks up with her for fear of being hurt. Reconnecting with Jexi, Phil reverts to his bad habits, becoming a slob dependent on his phone again.
Jexi lets slip which hotel Brody is staying at, and Phil deduces that she used Brody to separate him from Cate. He storms out, leaving his phone behind, but Jexi follows him through the streets. Chasing Phil in aself-driving car, Jexi crashes into the phone store and declares she and Phil are meant to be together forever. Phil seemingly surrenders, but tricks Jexi into shutting down for fifteen minutes.
Finding Cate at the hotel, Phil apologizes and punches Brody, who explains that he is leaving forBrazilwithout her. Phil and Cate get back together, and he makes up with Jexi, who tells him she is proud and happy for him, but there are other people who need her. Kai meets Jexi through his own phone, and starts to experience the same things Phil earlier endured.

In a 2009 interview, Byrne said that her mother was anatheist, while both she and her father wereagnostic.[8]Her family was described byThe Telegraphas "close-knit", and frequently kept her grounded as her career took off. "At one point one of my sisters had a word with me saying, 'Watch yourself'", she once remarked. "But they were really supportive."[9]
Byrne attended Balmain Public School,[10]Australian Theatre for Young People(at age eight, encouraged by one of her sisters),[11]andHunters Hill High School[11]before attendingBradfield Senior College[12]for years 11 and 12.[13]She later lived in the Sydney suburbs ofNewtownandBondi.[14]Growing up, she experienced "plenty of rejection" from film schools. "I auditioned for a few of the big drama schools—Nepean,WAAPA,NIDA—and didn't get in to any of them. I was really disappointed with myself. I wasn't quite sure if I'd be legitimate without training for three years in a more traditional sense". Instead, she studied an arts degree atSydney University.
"I still have great memories of those days: studying, working, auditioning. Just being a jobbing actor trying to figure out life after high school".[15]In 1999, she studied acting at theAtlantic Theater Company, which was developed byDavid MametandWilliam H. Macy. She also acted in the movie adaption of classic Broadway musical Annie.

Byrne revealed in a post-award interview that, prior to winning the Venice Film Festival Award, she was surprised by her own performance and found it confronting watching the film because her acting was "too depressing". Byrne admitted that "watching myself is confronting because I'm convinced I can't act and I want to get out, that's how insecure I am."[5]

"You gravitate to where you want to go, but so much is out of your control", she remarked. After the success ofDamages, she asked her agents to send her out for comedies. "I was doing all of this really heavy, dramatic stuff, and I just needed a break,” she said.[17]Her request was met when she obtained the role of a scandalous pop star and the on-and-off girlfriend of a free-spirited rock star in the comedyGet Him to the Greek(2010), also starringRussell BrandandJonah Hill. DirectorNicholas Stolleradmitted that, in her audition, he thought: "'Why is she here?' Because, you know, very good actress, but very serious".

And that was that".[17]The film was a commercial success, with a gross of US$60.9 million in North America.[30]

The film was an arthouse success, withRotten Tomatoes' critical consensus reading: "Juliet, Naked's somewhat familiar narrative arc is elevated by standout work from a charming cast led by a well-matched Rose Byrne and Ethan Hawke."[57]I Am Mother(2019) is a thriller and sci-fi movie withClara Rugaardand Oscar winnerHilary Swank. Byrne costarred withAdam Devine,Alexandra Shipp, andWanda Sykesas a voiced a virtual assistant in the movieJexi(2019).[57]

Since the beginning of her career, her performances have been acclaimed by critics.[65][66][67]In 2018, Byrne was noted for her comedic work.[68]She consciously made the transition to less dramatic material in the late 2000s, finding the idea of being "boxed in" to be "insufferable".[17]"You have to be aggressive in this business,” she noted. "You have always got to push for what you want. Working with Glenn [Close, onDamages], she was the hardest worker ever. She was constantly pushing".[17]Her turn to comedy led toThe Hollywood Reportercalling her "the most in-demand supporting actress for comedies".[69]Deciderwrote a story titled "How Did Rose Byrne Become One of Our Best Comedic Actresses?", in which it was remarked: "Byrne's emergence as one of the brightest stars in theApatowverseis all the more remarkable for her lack of a comedy background. [...] Any doubts about Byrne's massive comedic talent—and afterBridesmaidsandNeighbors, you'd have to be pretty stubborn to still have doubts—were put to rest with 2015'sSpy, where she again steals the show as merciless terrorist Rayna. Byrne and McCarthy's private-plane banter is the highlight of the film and could have gone on another 30 minutes as far as I'm concerned".[70]
In 2013, Byrne lived in New York and said she remained insecure about a stable career: "I don't think that insecurity ever leaves you. You're a freelancer. There's always an element of uncertainty."[4]Byrne has supportedUNICEFAustralia as the face of the 2007 Designers United campaign, and was a jury member ofTropfestin 2006 and Tropfest@Tribeca[71]in 2007.

He moved from Sydney to New York City following Byrne's success onDamages. Their relationship ended in January 2010.[74]Byrne has been in a relationship with American actorBobby Cannavalesince 2012.
