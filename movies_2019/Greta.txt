Gretais a 2018psychological thrillerfilm directed byNeil Jordanand written by Ray Wright and Jordan. The film starsIsabelle Huppert,Chloë Grace Moretz,Maika Monroe,Colm FeoreandStephen Rea, and follows a young woman as she befriends a lonely widow who becomes disturbingly obsessed with her.
Gretaheld its world premiere at theToronto International Film Festivalon 6 September 2018. It was theatrically released on 1 March 2019 in the United States, byFocus Features. The film grossed over $18 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.
Frances McCullen, a young waitress living in New York City, finds a handbag on a subway train; the ID inside the bag reveals the owner to be a Greta Hideg. Frances visits Greta the next day to return the bag, and Greta invites her in for coffee. Greta tells Frances she is a widow from France, and her daughter Nicola is still there, studying in Paris. Frances and Greta become friends.
One night while having dinner at Greta's, Frances finds a closet full of handbags identical to the one she found on the train. Attached to the bags are names and phone numbers, including Frances' own. Disturbed by the discovery, Frances cuts ties with Greta, who then begins to stalk Frances, seeing herself as a replacement for Frances' late mother. After Greta turns up at Frances' work, Frances contacts the police and pursues a protection order, but is told the process will take months.
Frances meets a former lover of Nicola's, and discovers that Greta is Hungarian and not French, and that her sadistic behavior led to her daughter's suicide four years ago. Meanwhile, Greta has also taken up stalking Frances' best friend and roommate, Erica. Greta shows up at the restaurant to cause a scene, insisting Frances' mother had to die for them to meet. Greta suffers a nervous breakdown and is hospitalised.
Erica suggests Frances lie to Greta about leaving town to spend time with her father, and instead secretly hide in their apartment for a while. The following morning, Frances is drugged and kidnapped by Greta. After locking Frances in a wooden chest in a secret room at her house, Greta uses Frances' cell phone to separately text her father, Chris, and Erica, telling each that Frances is with the other. When Frances is released from the chest, she finds clothing and IDs of other young women Greta had previously kidnapped, implying that she has killed all of them. Greta also kills the dog Frances had helped her to adopt.
Erica and Chris eventually get together and realize that Frances is not with either of them. Greta forces Frances to learn Hungarian and to play the piano, trying to make her her new "daughter". While Greta is distracted during a cooking lesson, Frances severs Greta's little finger and then knocks her unconscious. Frances tries to escape, but finds all the doors and windows sealed off. Running into the basement to search for an exit, she finds one of Greta's previous victims under a plastic sheet. Greta sneaks up behind Frances and suffocates her until she passes out.
Chris hires a private investigator, Cody, to investigate Greta. Cody learns she was dismissed from her work as a nurse for misusing anaesthetics. When he meets with Greta in her home, Frances, gagged and bound, attempts to get his attention by shaking the bed; Greta blocks out the noise with music. Cody begins to realize there's a secret room nearby, but his discovery is cut short when Greta plunges a syringe into his neck, then shoots him with his own gun.
An indeterminate amount of time passes, and Greta leaves another handbag on the subway. A young woman arrives to return it. Greta invites her in for coffee, but starts to feel faint after finishing her own cup. The young woman suddenly sheds her disguise and reveals herself to be Erica, having drugged Greta's drink. Erica reveals that she's been searching for the handbag on the subway for a long time. Greta passes out and Erica finds Frances. As they try to escape, Greta emerges from the shadows and grabs at Frances before passing out again.
Erica and Frances lock Greta's unconscious body in the toy chest, using an Eiffel Tower trinket as a makeshift latch. After they leave to call the police, the lid of the chest rattles.

Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Neil Patrick Jordan(born 25 February 1950) is an Irish film director, screenwriter, novelist and short-story writer. He first achieved recognition for his short story collection,Night in Tunisia,which won theGuardian Fiction Prizein 1979.[1][2]After a stint working atRTÉ, he made his directorial debut with the 1982 filmAngel.
Jordan's best-known films include the crime thrillersMona Lisa(1986) andThe Crying Game(1992), the horror dramasInterview with the Vampire(1994) andByzantium(2012), the biopicMichael Collins(1996), the black comedyThe Butcher Boy(1997), theGraham GreeneadaptationThe End of the Affair(1999), the transgender-themed dramedyBreakfast on Pluto(2005), and the psychological thrillerGreta(2018). Jordan also created theShowtime Networktelevision seriesThe Borgias(2011–2013) and Sky Atlantic'sRiviera(2017–2020).
He is the recipient of numerous accolades for his film work, including anAcademy Award, twoBAFTA Awards, threeIFTA Film & Drama Awards, aGolden Lionand aSilver Bear. In 1996, he was honoured with receiving the FrenchOrdre des Arts et des Lettres.[3]
Jordan was born inSligo, the son of Angela (née O'Brien), a painter, and Michael Jordan, a professor.[4]He was educated atSt. Paul's College, Raheny.  Later, Jordan attendedUniversity College Dublin, where he studied Irish history and English literature. He graduated in 1972 with a BA in History. He became involved in student theatre there, where he metJim Sheridan, who also was later to become an important Irish film director. After graduation, in 1976 Jordan produced his first collection of short stories:Night in Tunisia and other Stories.[5]
Of his religious background, Jordan said in a 1999Saloninterview: "I was brought up a Catholic and was quite religious at one stage in my life, when I was young. But it left me with no scars whatever; it just sort of vanished." He said about his current beliefs that "God is the greatest imaginary being of all time. Along withEinstein'sGeneral Theory of Relativity, the invention of God is probably the greatest creation of human thought."[6]
Jordan's career began in the late 1970s working for the Irish television channelRTÉ. His work included writing storylines for the children's fantasy seriesWanderly Wagon.[7]His first collection of short stories,Night in Tunisia, was published byDublin's Irish Writers Co-operative in 1976. It won theGuardian Fiction Prizein 1979.[8]
In 1981, whenJohn Boormanwas filmingExcaliburin Ireland, he recruited Jordan as a "creative associate". A year later, Boorman was executive producer on Jordan's first featureAngel, a tale of a musician caught up inthe Troublesplayed byStephen Reawho has subsequently appeared in almost all of Jordan's films to date. During the 1980s, he directed films that won him acclaim, includingThe Company of WolvesandMona Lisa, both made in England.The Company of Wolves, a dark and sexually-themed reimagining of theLittle Red Riding Hoodfairy tale based on short stories byAngela Carter, became a cult favourite.
As a writer/director, Jordan has a highly idiosyncratic body of work, ranging from mainstream hits likeInterview with the Vampireto commercial failures likeWe're No Angelsto a variety of more personal, low-budgetarthousepictures. He was also the driving force behind the cable TV seriesThe Borgias.
Unconventional sexual relationships are a recurring theme in Jordan's work, and he often finds a sympathetic side to characters that audiences would traditionally consider deviant or downright horrifying. His filmThe Miracle, for instance, follows two characters who struggle to resist a strong, incestuous attraction.Interview with the Vampire, like theAnne Ricebook it was based on, focused on the intense, intimate interpersonal relationship of two undead men who murder humans nightly (although the pair never have sex, they are clearly lovers of a sort), accompanied by an equally complex vampire woman who is eternally trapped in the body of a little girl. While Lestat (Tom Cruise) is depicted in an attractive but villainous manner, his partner Louis (Brad Pitt) and the child vampire Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) are meant to capture the audience's sympathy despite their predatory nature. In the remake ofThe End of the Affair, two people (Ralph FiennesandJulianne Moore) engage in a love affair that will end as suddenly as it started, with both not wanting its end.
In addition to the unusual sexuality of Jordan's films, he frequently returns to the Troubles ofNorthern Ireland.The Crying GameandBreakfast on Plutoboth concern a transgender character (played byJaye DavidsonandCillian Murphy, respectively), both concern The Troubles and both feature frequent Jordan leading man Stephen Rea. The two films, however, are very different, withThe Crying Gamebeing a realistic thriller/romance, andBreakfast on Plutois a much more episodic, stylised, darkly comic biography. Jordan also frequently tells stories about children or young people, such asThe MiracleandThe Butcher Boy. While his pictures are most often grounded in reality, he occasionally directs more fantastic or dreamlike films, such asThe Company of Wolves,High Spirits,Interview with the VampireandIn Dreams.
The critical success of Jordan's early pictures led him to Hollywood, where he directedHigh SpiritsandWe're No Angels; both were critical and financial disasters. He later returned home to make the more personalThe Crying Game, which was nominated for six Academy Awards. Jordan won theAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplayfor the film.[9]Its unexpected success led him back to American studio filmmaking, where he directedInterview with the Vampire. He also directed the crime dramaThe Brave Onestarring Jodie Foster.
Neil Gaimanannounced during hisTodayshow appearance on 27 January 2009, that Neil Jordan would be directing the film of hisNewbery Medal-winning bookThe Graveyard Book.[10]Jordan also wrote and directed the 2009 Irish-made filmOndine, starringColin FarrellandAlicja Bachleda-Curuś. He also directedByzantium, an adaptation of the vampire play of the same name starringSaoirse Ronan,Gemma ArtertonandJonny Lee Miller.[11]
In 2011, Jordan's next feature was announced as the later aborted sci-fi romanceBroken Dream, which was to have featuredBen KingsleyandJohn Hurt.[12]
He directed the thrillerGreta(2018), starringIsabelle HuppertandChloë Grace Moretz.
After working on the scripts forRiviera, Jordan has disowned the show, due to his scripts being reworked by others. He said he had no idea who rewrote these episodes. "They were changed, to my huge surprise and considerable upset. There were various sexual scenes introduced into the story and a lot of very expository dialogue. I objected in the strongest terms possible."[13]
Jordan has five children: Anna and Sarah from his marriage to solicitor Vivienne Shields; Dashiel and Daniel from his current marriage to Brenda Rawn, and Ben, from a relationship with architect Mary Donohoe. Jordan lives inDalkey, Dublin.[14]
In 1996, Neil Jordan was honoured with receiving the FrenchOrdre des Arts et des Lettres.[15]He has received many honorary doctorates, most notably fromTrinity College Dublin,University College Dublin, andQueen's University Belfast.[16][17][18]
In 2009, he signed a petition in support of directorRoman Polanski, calling for his release after he was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.[19][20]
In 2018, he donated his archives to theNational Library of Ireland. Jordan's donation included TV and film scripts, production files, notebooks, storyboards and personal correspondence with artists and political figures.[21]

The film was shown Out of Competition at the1972 Cannes Film Festival.

In 1974 she acted inAlain Robbe-Grillet's art filmSuccessive Slidings of PleasureandRachel Weinberg's fantasy filmL'Ampélopède. She also gained notoriety for her later appearance as Suzanne inBertrand Blier's controversialsex comedyLes Valseuses(1974). Huppert acted alongsideGérard DepardieuandJeanne Moreau.Vincent CanbyofThe New York Timespanned the film writing, "It's not very invigorating to see so much talent squandered on such foolish mixed-up romanticism."[14]The role made her increasingly recognized by the public.
The following year she acted inYves Boisset's dramaThe Common Man(1975) which won theSilver Bear Grand Jury Prizeat theBerlin International Film Festival.

Her international breakthrough came with her performance inClaude Goretta'sLa Dentelliere(1977),[15]for which she won aBAFTA Awardfor Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles. CriticRoger Ebertpraised her performance writing, "The movie’s performances are wonderfully subtle.

It was the first of seven collaborations she would have with director Chabrol.

The performances are much sharper than the film is as a whole."[19]Also in 1980 she acted inJean-Luc Godard'sSauve qui peut (la vie)(1980).
Throughout the 1980s, Huppert continued to explore enigmatic and emotionally distant characters, most notably inCoup de Torchon(1983) directed byBertrand Tavernier, adapted fromJim Thompson'spulp novelPop. 1280.

She won acclaim for her role inLa Séparation(1994) with David Parkinson ofBritish Film Institutewriting, "Her distinctive talent for suppressing suffering is readily evident in Christian Vincent’s excruciating study of her slowly disintegrating relationship with Daniel Auteuil, as Huppert imparts chilling intimacy to a withdrawn hand, an unanswering gaze, a treacherous silence and a careless word in conveying the pain of falling out of love."[21]She portrayed a manic and homicidal post-office worker inClaude Chabrol'sLa Cérémonie(1995) for which she won theCésar Award for Best Actressand theVolpi Cup for Best Actress. Huppert continued her cinematic relationship with Chabrol inRien ne va plus(1997) andMerci pour le Chocolat(2000).
Huppert's first collaboration with Austrian directorMichael Hanekewas inThe Piano Teacher(2001), based on the titular novel (Die Klavierspielerin) byElfriede Jelinek, who was named aNobel Laureate in Literaturein 2004.

Regarded as one of her most impressive turns, the performance won her the 2001Best Actress Awardat Cannes.David DenbyofThe New Yorkerpraised her work in the film, writing: "Much of her best acting is no more than a flicker of consciousness, barely visible around the edges of the mask. Yet she gives a classic account of repression and sexual hypocrisy, unleashing the kind of rage that the greatBette Davismight have expressed".[22]
In 2002 she acted in the dark comedy musical film8 Women, directed byFrançois Ozon. Jonathan Cruiel ofThe San Francisco Chroniclewrote of her: "Huppert has a reputation for her intense portrayals, and in8 Women, she steals every scene she's in as the uptight, melodramatic, bespectacled aunt."[23]In 2004, she starred inChristophe Honoré'sMa Mère, based on a novel byGeorges Bataille. She portrayed Hélène, a middle-aged mother in an incestuous relationship with her teenage son, played byLouis Garrel. She also starred oppositeDustin HoffmanandJason SchwartzmaninDavid O.

In 2014, the production toured in New York as a part of theLincoln CenterFestival.[35][36]Marilyn Stasio ofVarietywrote of Blanchett and Huppert's performances, "Blanchett gives a dynamic performance as Claire, the melodramatic sister, who flies into a fit at the least provocation. Huppert plays Solange as the smarter, more subtle, more bitterly ironic observer."[37]She continued acting in films such asThe Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby(2013),Macadam Stories(2015), andLouder Than Bombs(2015).
In 2016, she starred in two films that received widespread critical acclaim:Mia Hansen-Løve'sThings to Come, which premiered at theBerlinale, andPaul Verhoeven'sElle, which premiered atCannes.

Europe Theatre Prize
On 17 December 2017 she was awarded the XVIEurope Theatre Prize, inRome.[2]The Prize organization stated:
From her beginnings as a stage actress, Isabelle Huppert has moved between cinema and theatre with an extraordinary productivity, and with results which have made her perhaps the most garlanded performer in the two spheres. Her name, directly linked with French and European auteur cinema, is a guarantee of quality for the productions in which she takes part: she is an artist who chooses her scripts, her roles and the directors with whom she works with the greatest care, always able to make her mark on the films in which she appears. Isabelle Huppert, a world icon in contemporary cinema, has never abandoned the theatre, an art which she continues to practise with passion, deep interest and admirable playing skills. The reasons for her passionate love of theatre, which she herself gave in her message for this year'sWorld Theatre Day, are completely in accord with the motivation for the 16th Europe Theatre Prize, which we award to her this year with real pleasure: «Theatre for me represents the other; it is dialogue, and it is the absence of hatred. "Friendship between peoples" – now, I do not know too much about what this means, but I believe in community, in friendship between spectators and actors, in the lasting union between all the people theatre brings together – translators, educators, costume designers, stage artists, academics, practitioners and audiences. Theatre protects us; it shelters us…I believe that theatre loves us…as much as we love it… I remember an old-fashioned stage director I worked for, who, before the nightly raising of the curtain would yell, with full-throated firmness "Make way for theatre!"»[67]
Huppert holds the record for being the actress with the most films entered in the official competition of theCannes Film Festival.[68]As of 2022, she has had 22 films in the main competition and a total of 29 films screened at the festival.[69]Huppert's frequent Cannes' appearances have led her to be dubbed "the queen of Cannes" by journalists.[70][71][72][73]
David ThomsononClaude Chabrol'sMadame Bovary: "[Huppert] has to rate as one of the most accomplished actresses in the world today, even if she seems short of the passion or agony of her contemporary,Isabelle Adjani." Stuart Jeffries ofThe ObserveronThe Piano Teacher: "This is surely one of the greatest performances of Huppert's already illustrious acting career, though it is one that is very hard to watch." Director,Michael Haneke: "[Huppert] has such professionalism, the way she is able to represent suffering. At one end you have the extreme of her suffering and then you have her icy intellectualism. No other actor can combine the two."[3]Of her performance in 2007'sHidden Love,Roger Ebertsaid "Isabelle Huppert makes one good film after another.... she is fearless. Directors often depend on her gift for conveying depression, compulsion, egotism and despair. She can be funny and charming, but then so can a lot of actors. She is in complete command of a face that regards the void with blankness."[74]In 2010, S.T. VanAirsdale described her as "arguably the world's greatest screen actress."[75]
Huppert's work inElleandThings to CometoppedThe Playlist's ranking of "The 25 Best Performances Of 2016", stating: "She runs the emotional gamut from one film to the next, carnal, savage, shattered, listless, invulnerable but exposed, a woman on the verge of collapse who refuses to succumb to her instabilities. Huppert's career spans four decades and change, plus a heap of awards and accolades, but withElleandThings To Come, she could well be having her best year yet."[76]
