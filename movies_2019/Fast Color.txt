The film received positive reviews from critics with praise directed at Mbatha-Raw's performance and its uniqueness compared to other superhero films, but with criticism aimed at the script.
A television series based on the film is in development atAmazon Studios, withViola Davis' JuVee Productions producing, and with the film's original writers returning to script the show.
In the future American Midwest, where it has not rained for eight years, Ruth is a homeless wanderer whose seizures trigger supernatural earthquakes. As she travels to her old family home, she meets Bill, a diner customer who is actually a scientist attempting to capture Ruth for study. Bill tricks her into accepting a ride with him then attempts to draw blood samples from her, but Ruth wounds him and flees in the direction of her home. Bill is forced to seek medical aid, abandoning his vehicle, which catches the attention of the local sheriff, Ellis.
Arriving at the home, Ruth reunites with her mother Bo, who has the ability to telekinetically disintegrate objects, reassemble them, and see vibrant flashes known as "the colors". Lila mentions it's also like an after effect. Bo has been taking care of Ruth's daughter Lila, who has the same powers as Bo and has no memories of her mother. After Ruth accidentally sets off another earthquake, Lila is introduced to her and they explain that Ruth's powers deteriorated in her childhood, becoming destructive and causing her to abandon her family.
Lila and Bo attempt to train Ruth on reconnecting with her old powers, while the scientist and the sheriff investigate Ruth's trail. When Ellis discerns Ruth is back home, he covertly signals Bo, his longtime friend and lover, to warn her about the scientist that is searching for their daughter. The next morning, Bill begins heading for the women's house, and Ruth takes off in the family truck to escape him, leaving Bo and Lila behind. When she exits miles later for gasoline, her seizures return. Ruth relives the memory of her nearly drowning her then-infant daughter during a past episode, and then of saving her life, emotionally healing and causing the sky to rain again.
Ruth returns home, where Ellis informs her that Bill and his accomplices kidnapped Lila. Ruth goes to rescue her, followed by Ellis and Bo. At the sheriff's office where Lila is being held, Ruth creates a storm and panics Bill and his guards. Bo offers herself to the scientists in exchange for Lila, who is reunited with her mother. The two escape in the truck, and find a note from Bo telling them to head for Rome to find another woman that she used to know with powers.

The film had its world premiere atSouth by Southweston March 10, 2018.[7][8]Shortly after,Codeblack Filmsacquired distribution rights to the film and set it for a March 29, 2019, release.[9]It was then pushed back to April 19, 2019, withLionsgatenow distributing the film fromCodeblack Films.[1]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 80% based on 87 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's critic consensus states: "A grounded superhero story with more on its mind than punching bad guys,Fast Colorleaps over uneven execution with a singular Gugu Mbatha-Raw performance."[10]OnMetacriticthe film has a weighted average score of 64% based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[11]
Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film 31⁄2out of 4 stars and praised Mbatha-Raw for her performance, and director Julia Hart for "genuinely moving drama, an engrossing, supernatural-sci-fi mystery and some pretty darn impressive special effects."[12]Sheri Linden ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "Hart has fashioned a tale of matriarchal inheritance, but one whose fierce message is undercut rather than deepened by its child's-book clarity. The intriguing setup receives underpowered execution, the intended jolts landing all too softly."[13]Amy Nicholson ofVarietywrote: "Ultimately,Fast Color's thesis is more inspirational than the film, which often seems like it, too, is struggling to swirl itself into something more solid. Instead, its magical sparks don’t quite congeal as the audience can’t help hoping a movie this empathetic and unusual reaches transcendence".[14]
As of 2019, a TV series based on the film was in development atAmazon Studios. The show was set to be produced byViola Davisand Julius Tennon's company JuVee Productions, with the return of the film's writers Julia Hart and Jordan Horowitz.[15]However, as of January 2025, no such series has materialized.
