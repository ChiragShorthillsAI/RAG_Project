Gloria Bellis a 2018comedy-dramafilm co-written and directed bySebastián Lelio; it is an English languageremakeof his 2013 filmGloria. The film starsJulianne Moore,John Turturro,Michael Cera,Caren Pistorius,Brad Garrett,Jeanne Tripplehorn,Rita Wilson,Sean Astin, andHolland Taylor. It had its world premiere at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 7, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8, 2019, byA24.
Gloria Bell is a middle-aged divorcée living in Los Angeles. She has two children: Anne, a kindhearted yoga instructor, and Peter, an uninspired married man who cares for his infant son while his wife is away. Gloria spends her nights letting loose at dance clubs around the city that play 1970s and 1980sdance music.
One night, Gloria meets Arnold, also a divorcée, and they hit it off. They sleep together and begin a relationship shortly after. However, Gloria is annoyed when Arnold admits that he still financially supports his ex-wife and two daughters, who are unemployed and demanding. He owns apaintball arenaand introduces her to the sport.
At Peter's birthday party, Gloria introduces Arnold to her children, ex-husband Dustin, and Dustin's wife Fiona. During a toast, Gloria unwittingly reveals that Anne is pregnant; the father is a Swedishwave riderand she plans to move to Sweden with him, which Dustin was not aware of.
Later, they look at old family photos including Gloria and Dustin's wedding pictures. The exes laugh at the old photos but Arnold, feeling left out, leaves unnoticed. When Gloria realizes Arnold has left, everyone goes looking for him before giving up. She leaves the party embarrassed.
Arnold repeatedly calls her, and finally catches up with her as she is leaving work. He attempts to justify his sudden exit from the party by claiming he tried initiating eye contact with her but her eyes were not  looking for him. When Arnold again mentions his daughters' calls, Gloria blows him off. She tries to return hispaintball gunsbut he refuses, so she drives away with them.
Gloria's mentally unstable neighbor leaves hismarijuanaon her doorstep one night, and, impulsively, she smokes it and goes dancing. The next day, she drives Anne to the airport for her trip to Sweden, tearfully accepting her daughter is grown up. Soon after, Gloria is told by a doctor that she will have to take prescription eyedrops for the rest of her life for her failing eyesight.
Gloria finally returns Arnold's calls and they arrange a trip toLas Vegas. As they are settling into their room, he again receives a call from his daughters, who inform him that his ex-wife injured herself walking through a sliding glass door. Despite his daughters' protests, Arnold refuses to cancel the trip, and he and Gloria have sex that night.
During a romantic dinner together, Gloria suggests that they take a trip to Spain. Arnold agrees; when Arnold's phone continues to ring, Gloria drops it in his soup. He excuses himself, saying he'll be right back. After some time passes, Gloria realizes that Arnold has deserted her and discovers he has checked out of their hotel room, leaving her without her luggage or a place to stay.
To drown her sorrows, Gloria dazedly drinks and gambles with random people, hooking up with their friend and experiencing ahallucinatory trip. She wakes up on a pool chair missing a shoe and calls her mother to take her home.
Arnold tries calling Gloria multiple times and she unplugs her phone in response. Coming across the paintball guns in her car trunk, she resolves to throw them away, but goes back to retrieve them at the last minute. Driving to Arnold's house, she silently shoots his house and him in anger. His ex-wife and daughters rush outside yelling obscenities, but Gloria remains unfazed and drives away, laughing with "Total Eclipse of the Heart" playing on her stereo.
At the wedding reception for the daughter of her friend Vicky, Gloria is asked to dance as the song "Gloria" starts to play, but she politely declines. Vicky coaxes her out, and Gloria changes her mind, gets on the dance floor and begins to lose herself in the music.
On May 12, 2017, it was reported thatSebastián Leliowould direct a reimagining of his 2013 filmGloriastarringJulianne Moore. "As one of the greatest actresses in the world, Julianne giving her interpretation of the character is not only a huge honor, it's irresistible. It's going to be like jazz, you'll feel the spirit of the original story but it'll be re-invigorated and vital," said Lelio.[5]On November 16, 2017, it was reported that the film had begun production.John Turturro,Michael Cera,Brad Garrett,Holland Taylor, andCaren Pistoriusalso joined the cast.[6]
It had its world premiere at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 7, 2018.[7]Prior to that,A24had acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film.[8]It was released on March 8, 2019.[3]
Gloria Bellgrossed $5.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $10.6 million.[3]
The film made $145,218 from five theaters in its opening weekend, the second best per-venue average ($29,044) of the weekend behind the blockbusterCaptain Marvel.[9]In its third weekend, the film expanded to 654 theaters and made $1.7 million, finishing eighth.[10]
Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 206 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Free of visual or narrative embellishments,Gloria Bellrests almost completely on Julianne Moore's performance in the title role – and she's gloriously up to the task."[11]Metacriticgave the film a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[12]
Gwilym Mumford ofThe Guardiangave the film four stars out of five, saying, "there's a warm universality here that is absorbing in its own right."[13]Stephen Dalton ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "Although he reconstructs the original film's narrative virtually scene by scene, Lelio strikes a more overtly comic note inGloria Bellthan in the original."[14]
Peter Debruge ofVarietycalled it "one of the great female-led films of the 21st century, passing theBechdel testwith flying colors — which explains why Moore would be so keen to remake it."[15]Manohla DargisofThe New York Timeswrote: "a transcendent Julianne Moore," the director "is acutely sensitive to the absurdities of everyday life, including the comedy of humiliation, both petty and wounding."[16]
In contrast, some film critics criticized the remake's existence. OnMi Cine Tu Cine, a Mexican film review TV program, Alonso Díaz de la Vega called it "unnecessary", "burying the triumph ofPaulina GarcíaandSergio Hernández's performances" (the original version's protagonists) and "hiding the Latin American work" as a way in which Hollywood wants to tell how to get a notion of success; while Arantxa Luna and Jean-Christophe Berjon emphasized the change of actress, remarking Garcia's performance as "more fresh" and "more profound".[17]

In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

Sebastián Lelio Watt(born 8 March 1974) is a Chilean director, screenwriter, editor and producer.[1]He received critical acclaim for directing the filmsGloria(2013) andA Fantastic Woman(2017), the latter of which won anAcademy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.
Lelio was born in Mendoza, Argentina and moved to Viña del Mar, Chile at the age of 2 with his Chilean mother Valeria. He describes his early life as "nomadic": "Up to the age of 21, I was moving between different cities in Chile. I lived for a time in the United States, and also in Viña del Mar; my maternal family is from Viña...essentially I was never more than two or three years in the same city."[2]
After some years in Viña, his mother moved toConcepción; later, they lived for one year in North America; from the age of 12 to 17, he lived in Cholguán (Yungay, Chile).[citation needed]
Born with the surname Lelio, he changed his surname to that of his adoptive father Campos, but after having attained some fame with his first film, Lelio again took his biological father's name.[2]
After studying journalism for one year atAndrés Bello University, Lelio graduated from the Chilean Film School (Escuela de Cine de Chile). He has directed many short films and musical videos. In 2003, he releasedCero, a documentary based on unedited material from the 2001September 11 attacksin New York, co-directing with Carlos Fuentes. He directed two seasons of the successful documentary seriesMi mundo privado(My private life) together with Fernando Lavanderos. The series followed the private lives of Chilean families from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and was nominated twice for theAltazor Awardsand also theEmmy Awards.[3][4]
In 2005, his debut feature filmLa Sagrada Familia(The Sacred Family) premiered at theSan Sebastián International Film Festival. Filmed over three days and edited over a period of almost one year, the film screened in over one hundred festivals and received a number of national and international awards. In 2009, his second feature film,Navidad(Christmas), premiered at theCannes Film Festival.[5]
The Year of the Tiger(Spanish:El Año del Tigre), Lelio's third feature film, premiered at theLocarno International Film Festivalin 2011.[6]The film is set in the aftermath of the2010 Chile earthquakeand follows an escaped prisoner as he journeys through areas hit hardest by the quake.[7]
As with his first two films,The Year of the Tigerexplores religious faith and how it influences people's behaviours. Lelio told an interviewer fromThe Clinic(magazine), "What I find fascinating is the interplay between the question of meaning that religion poses - a basic question - with the fact that in Chile, in Latin America, the Judeo-Christian version of reality is dominant.
