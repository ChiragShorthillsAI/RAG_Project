Heitor Pereirareturned to compose the film's score, with artists such asKeshaandLuke Combscontributing tracks for the film. It also features classical pop songs from the 1960s to 2000s, as in the first film.
The Angry Birds Movie 2was theatrically released in Finland on August 7, 2019, and in the United States on August 14. It was not as financially successful as its predecessor, grossing $152.8 million on a $65 million budget. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who nevertheless considered it an improvement over its predecessor. A sequel,The Angry Birds Movie 3, is in production.
Bird Island, led by Red, and Piggy Island, led by King Leonard, are in a prank war against each other. One day, a giant ice ball from nearby Eagle Island hits the sea near Piggy Island, forcing the pigs to seek a permanenttrucewith the birds. Zeta, the leader of Eagle Island, is angry with her frozen surroundings and wants to occupy the two islands by shooting ice balls from a superweapon to force their inhabitants to evacuate. Red's two best friends, Chuck and Bomb, surprise and ask Red to join them in a speed dating activity, where Red meets Chuck's sister Silver, an engineering student, who deems Red incompatible. Meanwhile, Zoe – the daughter of Red's anger management classmate Terence and teacher Matilda – loses the eggs containing her unborn sisters while playing with her friends, Vincent and Samantha, so they try to recover the eggs.
Leonard visits and convinces Red to form an alliance, recruiting Chuck, Bomb, Silver, Mighty Eagle, and Leonard's new assistant Courtney. A secret meeting in Mighty Eagle's cave gets disrupted when Zeta's superweapon hits Eagle Mountain, which alarms the other birds living on Bird Island. As the team, now joined by pig gadgeteer Garry, travels to Eagle Island bysubmarine, Red assures the other birds that they do not need to evacuate. Once there, Mighty Eagle confesses that Zeta was once his fiancée, but he abandoned her due tocowardicebefore he flies away. Red insists on fighting alone, but Silver decides to follow him instead. They intrude the base from the mouth of the weapon and get captured and frozen into inflatable water toys. Zeta tells them her plan to fire ice balls filled with lava at both islands and demonstrates her newly upgraded cannon. Red, regretting not telling the birds to evacuate, admits his wish to be liked by everyone to Silver, who comforts him and frees them both. Meanwhile, the other team members disguise themselves as an eagle and grab a key card to get into the base, reunited with Red and Silver and establishes a plan to destroy the cannon as it begins to load up ammunition in ten minutes for the actual attack on both islands.
Red and Silver put themselves inside an ice ball and roll it down the spiralling ammunition track of Zeta's cannon, with their allies distracting the eagles and working to sever the track by reaching and pulling a switch so that the ball flies off and crushes the cannon. The plan fails and Zeta and her guards confronted them, giving her a chance to fire the weapon. Mighty Eagle arrives and makes a desperate attempt to stop Zeta by apologizing to her for abandoning her. Zeta brushes him off, revealing his real name is Ethan and that her assistant Debbie is their daughter. While Zeta is distracted, Chuck ties up the weapon using Silver's new invention, a very strong string called Super-String, which catches and decelerates the lava balls after Zeta fires them. As the string breaks, the hatchlings, who finally recovered their eggs, along with some piglets who had joined them on their quest back home, pass by Eagle Island and help grasp the string. The lava balls slide back into the cannon, destroying it and the base. Everyone escapes, and Mighty Eagle protects Debbie from being crushed by a metal plate, redeeming himself to her and Zeta.
Mighty Eagle and Zeta get married on Bird Island, with Red as the chief witness and Debbie as the flower girl, and the rest of the birds, pigs, and eagles celebrate. Afterwards, Red credits Silver and the entire team for saving the islands, and as a result, finds himself even more beloved for his honesty and selflessness and starts a relationship. Meanwhile, the hatchlings discover they have accidentally recovered a boa constrictor's eggs rather than Zoe's sisters. The older hatchlings and boa constrictor return each others' hatched eggs, but Zoe's sisters set out to sea to the older hatchlings' dismay.
A sequel toThe Angry Birds Moviewas announced in August 2016.[4]It was directed byThe Marvelous Misadventures of FlapjackandHome: Adventures with Tip & OhcreatorThurop Van Orman, co-directed by John Rice, and written byPeter Ackerman. John Cohen returned fromThe Angry Birds Movieto serve as producer, with animation again handled bySony Pictures Imageworks.[5]Imageworks' sister studioSony Pictures Animationalso released the film under their banner, despite having dropped out of co-producing the project beforehand and had not co-produced the first film either.[6]
In the summer of 2017, production designerPete Oswaldstated that the sequel would be more of an adventure movie that introduces new characters and locations into the world first established inThe Angry Birds Movie. While he was not in a position to offer further details about the plot and characters, which remained unknown until the months before the film's release, he expressed hope that it would be a better film than the first installment.[7]
The creative decision to break from the games' source material and have the birds and pigs end their conflict and form an alliance to face a greater threat was one that was made out of a desire to surprise audiences with a new experience with the same characters, as well as attempt to outdo what was accomplished in the first film with an unprecedented level of creative freedom available.[8]Josh Gadstated that the production team went forward with such idea because it was not only an "ingenious" one, but also because they felt it would feel most appropriate in light of the increasingly polarized political climate at the time, as people who disagree on significant issues struggle to find common ground.[9]
Overall, the budget was approximately $65 million.[2]
In April 2018, the majority of the voice cast was announced.Jason Sudeikis, Gad,Danny McBride,Maya Rudolph,Bill Hader, andPeter Dinklagewill reprise their roles from the first film.Leslie Joneswill voice a new female villain,[10][11]revealed to be Zeta in the teaser trailer.[12]In December 2018,Nicki Minajjoined the cast of the film.[13]Upon its release, the teaser trailer briefly revealed that Hal, a green boomerang bird from the games and the first film, would return in the sequel,[14]withAnthony Padillareturning to voice Hal.[15]The following day, producer John Cohen announced in a tweet thatAwkwafinawill voice Courtney, the first named female pig in theAngry Birdsfranchise that briefly appeared in the teaser.[16]
When the film's first full trailer was released on March 27, 2019, more details about the sequel's characters and their voice roles were revealed. Among several new characters confirmed to appear in the movie was Silver, a bird first introduced in theAngry Birds 2game, voiced byRachel Bloom, and Ella, voiced byDove Cameron.[17]In June,Peoplerevealed the identity of the white bird living with Zeta in the teaser trailer as Debbie, voiced byTiffany Haddishwho was one of several voice actors not listed in the initial casting.[18]Later that month, the film's final trailer revealed that Terence, a large red bird from the first film, would appear withoutSean Pennreprising his voice role, andNolan Northreplacing Penn.[19]
Unlike the previous film, the sequel was co-produced with Rovio Animation and Sony Pictures Animation. While it was possible to reuse assets from the first film instead of starting from scratch, significant work was needed to make them compatible with new technological systems that were adopted in the past few years. The animators faced great challenges attempting to create more realisticfeathersystems for the Birds'plumage, even with the help of Sony Pictures Imageworks' existing feather system that was first used inStuart Little(1999), especially when it came to designing the villain Zeta, the hardest character to animate in the film with over 1,000 controls, a very complex face structure and a tall, flexible torso. The team also faced a demanding task in designing visual effects for snow, ice, water and lava for the film and production was also affected by the unavailability of certain animators who were being used to completeSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018) months prior, as well as the amount of time lost due to Sony moving the film's release date ahead by more than half a month.[20]
Heitor Pereira, who previously composed the first film, returned to compose the score ofThe Angry Birds Movie 2.[21]On July 25, 2019,Keshareleased her song "Best Day" for the film as a single.[22]Days later,Luke Combsreleased a song, "Let's Just Be Friends" for the film as a single as well.[23]Both singles were played in the film's end credits.
Also included on the film wasGiacomo Puccini's aria “Un bel di vedremo” from his operaMadama Butterfly.[24]However this was credited as “Opera”, by Heitor Pereira in the soundtrack.
The film's soundtrack, titledThe Angry Birds Movie 2: Original Motion Picture Soundtrackwas released on August 9, 2019, only in digital format and is available to download through payment platforms. It includes two songs previously unreleased and original from the movie:Luke Combs' "Let's Just Be Friends" andKesha's "Best Day (Angry Birds 2 Remix)". The rest of the album consists of a compilation of eighteen classical pop music hits from the 1960s to 2000s decades, in different genres and various artists.[25]
As with the first film, Sony also attempted to connect the film to certainsocial causeswhile marketing it, leveraging the premise of the threat of worlds being frozen to call attention to urgent action onclimate change[26]and using Silver, who is depicted as a technical expert, as a model to inspire more young women topursue STEM disciplines.[27]
A cooperative tie-in video game,The Angry Birds Movie 2 VR: Under Pressure, was released exclusively for thePlayStation 4'sPlayStation VRsystem[28]on August 6, 2019.[29]The game takes place aboard the Piggy Gadget Lab that the main characters use to get to Eagle Island for the film's climatic confrontation.

The film's North American theatrical release was preceded byHair Love(2019), aKickstarter-funded campaign short film created byMatthew A. CherryandBruce W. Smith.[34]

All releases include an animated short film entitledLive Stream. The Ultra HD Blu-ray version was the first release of its kind to beIMAXenhanced.[35]
The Angry Birds Movie 2has grossed $41.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $110.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $152.8 million.[2][3]
In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $16–18 million from 3,800 theaters over its first six days of release.[36]It made $2.6 million on its first day, ranking fifth and $1.7 million on its second.[37]It ended up making $16.2 million over the six-day span (including an opening weekend of $10.6 million), finishing in fifth. It was less than a third of the first film's $38.1 million debut, and was blamed on the marketing making the sequel look the same as the first, as well as the crowded marketplace.[38]The Angry Birds Movie 2completed its theatrical run in the United States and Canada on November 14, 2019.[39]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 72% of 109 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's consensus reads: "Like its non-aerodynamic title characters,The Angry Birds Movie 2takes improbable yet delightfully entertaining flight, landing humorous hits along the way."[40]It is rated higher than the first film, and the time of its release was the best-reviewed film adaptation of a video game on Rotten Tomatoes.[a][41][42]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 60 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[43]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by its predecessor, andPostTrakgave the film a 4 out of 5 stars and 72% "definite recommend" from parents and kids under 12.[37]
Guy Lodge ofVarietysummarized his review with: "Perked up by some ingenious slapstick and Leslie Jones' inspired voice work, this gumball-bright sequel to 2016's game-based spinoff is another unexpected pleasure."[44]Sandie Chen ofCommon Sense Mediagave the film a three out of five stars stating, "Silly pranks, an ace voice cast, and a super-team mission storyline make this fast-paced sequel more fun than the original. It's a predictably well-intentioned second installment, in which the birds and pigs are forced to work together against an even more formidable foe. It also shows how Red's insecurity lingers, since he was only recently accepted and respected. Although some of the movie's jokes and sight gags are recycled (because, frankly, it's unlikely that little kids will ever get tired of naked piggy-butt jokes), the addition of the third mystery island is interesting enough to keep younger audiences guessing."[45]Stephen Dalton ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote, "It may lack the refined wit and revered pedigree of blue-chip animation franchises such asToy Story, but it still ticks plenty of lightweight fun boxes for its prime target audience of younger children, with just enough adult humor to keep parents from yawning, too."[46]Bob Hoose ofPlugged In (publication)praised the humor, stating, "Surprisingly, the whole frenetic animated escapade ends up being pretty entertaining and funny. Even adults will, at some point, snort out an unexpected chortle."[47]Simon Thompson ofIGNgave the film a 6 out of 10 stating, "The Angry Birds Movie 2does what you'd expect it to do, some nice touches move the franchise forward, but it could have dug deeper as some other franchises have. The whole is less than the sum of its parts, but those parts just about make the grade. Kids or a certain age will love it, and ultimately that's all that really matters here."[48]
On June 6, 2024, Rovio announced that a third film was in production, with new parent companySega Sammy Groupproducing alongside Rovio Animation,Prime Focus Studios,One Cool Films, Flywheel Media, andDentsu. It is currently unknown if Sony is involved.[51]John Rice has been attached to direct with Jason Reicher co-directing, Thurop Van Orman writing the screenplay and John Cohen, Dan Chuba, and Carla Connor producing, while Jason Sudeikis and Josh Gad would reprise their roles as Red and Chuck, respectively.[52]
