After touring factory locations inMansfield, Ohiofor her father's company,Hong Kong-based Zhang Innovations, Daya Zhang and her entourage are abducted by terrorists despite her bodyguard and head of security Bao Yung attempting to fight them off. The kidnappers leave Yung unconscious with aUSB flash driveaddressed to security expert Ray Breslin.
InLos Angeles, Breslin crosses paths with Shen Lo, a former Zhang Innovations bodyguard. Both men are after Daya's father Wu Zhang, whose company is responsible for building covert prisons around the world. They meet with Breslin's associates – his girlfriend Abigail, Hush, and Jules – when Yung arrives with the flash drive. It contains a video message from Lester Clark, Jr., Daya's kidnapper and the son of Breslin's former partner; in business with Zhang,Lester, Sr. betrayed Breslin and was sent to his death.
Breslin reaches out to Trent DeRosa, an associate, and they trace the video to a prison compound inLatviaknown as “Devil's Station”. Abigail is also abducted, and Wu, having arrived in Mansfield to meet with police, receives a video call from Lester. Seeking revenge for his father's downfall, Lester demands a $700 million ransom, and executes a hostage. Breslin, DeRosa, Jules, Shen, and Yung depart for Latvia to rescue Daya and Abigail.
When Lester threatens the prisoners and kills a hostage, Wong, Zhang Innovations' technology analyst, agrees to give him access to Zhang's technology. Hush surveils the prison bydrone, and itsthermal imaging camerareveals Lester has created his ownblack site. Breslin infiltrates the compound through the sewers while Shen and Yung approach the outer walls. Alerted to their presence, Lester leaves Daya atop the wall as bait. Realizing Lester is leading them into a trap, Shen tries to hold position and wait for Breslin, but Yung charges recklessly ahead, and he and Shen are subdued byland minesand kidnapped. Lester reveals that the flash drive was a tracker that led his men to Abigail, and deduces that Shen and Daya are in love. He shoots Yung and taunts Breslin by video call before sliting Abigail's neck with a knife
Breslin proceeds through the compound, killing several of Lester's henchmen. Shen steals a guard'sstun gunas he is taken to the cells, using it to start a fire; he melts his restraints and subdues the terrorist in the smoke. He frees Daya, but they are confronted by more terrorists. DeRosa arrives, killing the terrorists withincendiary rounds. In the ensuing chaos, Shen kills Lester's remaining henchman Silva in a hand-to-hand fight, while rescuing Wong. Trapped in a shootout with Lester in the upper cells, Breslin is wounded and disarmed, but manages to overpower Lester before sliting his neck with a knife and pushing him off of the balcony, avenging Abigail.
Returning to Mansfield, Daya coldly greets her father, now aware of the true nature of his business, before leaving with Shen. DeRosa comforts Breslin over Abigail's death, urging him to forgive himself, while at the same time persuading Breslin to join him in South America; claiming that Breslin owes him one and Breslin decides to retire.
During the ending credits, Yung is revealed to have survived but heavily wounded. He is seen crawling and stumbling through the sewers and proceeds to escape by himself.
Breslin wearing security overalls, carrying a semi automatic weapon, drops through a central shaft from the ceiling into the tunnel sewers, just moments after Yung had already been seen arriving into the same tunnel from a side shaft, seemingly stalking Yung.
Vincent D'Onofrioalso appears as Lester Clark in archive footage fromEscape Plan.

He won aDaytime Emmy Awardfor directing the 1980ABC Afterschool SpecialtitledStoned.
Herzfeld was born on April 15, 1947, inNewark, New Jerseyand grew up inWest Orange, New Jersey. His father, who ran a small maintenance company, had a great love of movies, theater and ballet, and exposed his children to the arts as often as he could.[2]
Herzfeld began his directing career with twoABC Afterschool Specials. He won a Daytime Emmy for best directing in children's programming for his work on the 1980 filmStoned,[3]the story of a shy, bullied high school student (played byScott Baio) who becomes involved with marijuana.[4]He also won the first annual "Scott Newman Drug Abuse Prevention Award" for his writing onStoned.[5]In addition to writing and directing, Herzfeld also played the part of a concerned teacher inStoned.[4]His secondAfterschool Special,Run, Don't Walk, also starred Scott Baio about two teenager learning to cope with their life in wheelchairs.
In 1983, Herzfeld made his debut as a feature film director in the romantic comedy,Two of a Kind, starringOlivia Newton-JohnandJohn Travolta.[6]Travolta plays a failed inventor who robs a bank, and Newton-John is a teller who puts deposit slips in Travolta's bag and keeps the cash for herself. In heaven, a group of angels (including two portrayed byCharles DurningandScatman Crothers) try to persuade God (voice byGene Hackman) not to send a new plague to the Earth if these two characters can be reformed.[6]The film was a critical and commercial flop and was nominated for fiveGolden Raspberry Awardsincluding both Worst Director and Worst Screenplay for Herzfeld, although itssoundtrack albumwas praised and certifiedPlatinum.
In the late 1980s and 1990s, Herzfeld directed and wrote several made-for-TV movies, including:
In 1996, Herzfeld returned to feature films as the director and screenwriter of the crime thriller2 Days in the Valleywith an all-star cast that included Danny Aiello,Jeff Daniels,Teri Hatcher,Charlize Theron,Keith Carradine,Eric Stoltz,Marsha Mason,James Spader,Paul MazurskyandLouise Fletcher. The film was Charlize Theron's feature film debut.
Herzfeld described the movie, which follows ten characters over 48 hours in theSan Fernando Valley, as follows: "The movie is about a lot of people who either never achieved their goals, or screwed up their lives, or dropped the football the first time it was thrown to them. What a lot of characters share in common is this unrealized potential."[10]
When the press kit and advance newspaper stories for2 Days in the Valleydepicted Herzfeld as "a first-time feature filmmaker" moving from the small screen to the big screen, theLos Angeles Timespublished a story focusing on the omission of Herzfeld's earlier work onTwo of a Kind.[6]
In 1997, Herzfeld directedDon King: Only in America, a biographical dramatization of the life of boxing promoterDon Kingaired byHBO. The film starredVing Rhamesas King andJeremy Pivenin a supporting role as closed-circuit promoter Hank Schwartz.[11]The film received much critical success winning the Emmy Award for Outstanding Made for Television Movie, as well as the Directors Guild of America's DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Dramatic Specials. At the time, Herzfeld described his goal for the film:
"I'm trying to tell the tale of a full-rounded character--comes from a dark past, lives in a dark world where there's always clouds overhead and somehow when the ground separates underneath him, he always seems to jump over it and never fall in. ... And how he does that and who props him up and what and when, that's what the movie's all about."[12]
Herzfeld also wrote and directed the 2001 feature15 MinutespairingRobert De NiroandEdward Burns. Herzfeld wrote at the time that he intended the film as a study of the country's fascination with celebrity—thus the title's reference toAndy Warhol's famous quote about "15 minutes of fame."[13]The film received a mixed review from theLos Angeles Times, which noted:
"Like many ambitious, provocative films,15 Minutesis a bit of a mess. Both audacious and unwieldy, exciting and excessive, this dark thriller is too long, too violent and not always convincing. But at the same time, there's no denying that it's onto something, that its savage indictment of the nexus involving media, crime and a voracious public is a cinematic statement difficult to ignore."[14]
From 2004 to 2006, Herzfeld returned to television, writing and directing multiple episodes of theRob Loweseries,Dr. Vegas.
In 2007, Herzfeld directed the crime thrillerThe Death and Life of Bobby ZstarringPaul WalkerandLaurence Fishburne. Walker plays a prisoner offered a deal by the DEA in which he can win his freedom by impersonating a legendary drug dealer as part of a prisoner exchange.
In 2008, he wrote and directed the made-for-television featureSIS, about the Special Investigation Squad, an elite secret police force that hunts down criminals on the streets of Los Angeles.
In 2009, Herzfeld directed the 90-minute documentaryInferno: The Making Of The Expendablesfor his friendSylvester Stallone. The two first worked together in 1969 on a low-budget self-produced film calledHorses, and later again onCobra, where Herzfeld plays a goon that Stallone's character sets on fire during the film's climax. Herzfeld also directed Stallone in his 2014 film, which was produced by Seraphim Films Productions, his wife, Rebekah Chaney's company. Chaney applied for the CA Tax credit in 2011 and received the funding in 2012, with only 90 days allotted for pre-production or the credit would be awarded to another production. Chaney and Herzfeld started the process together before any cast members were assigned. Chaney is the original first producer of the filmReach Me.
