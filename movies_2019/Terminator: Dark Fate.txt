The film is set 25 years after the events ofTerminator 2, when the machines send an advanced Terminator (Luna) back in time to 2020 with instructions to kill Dani Ramos (Reyes), whose fate is connected to the future. The Resistance also sends Grace (Davis), an augmented soldier, back in time to defend Dani, who is also joined by Sarah Connor and Skynet's T-800.Principal photographytook place from June to November 2018 in Hungary, Spain, and the United States.
Distributed byParamount Picturesin the United States and Canada and20th Century Foxinternationally, the film was released theatrically in the United States on November 1, 2019.Terminator: Dark Fatereceived mixed reviews from critics, being considered an improvement over recent predecessors. However, the film grossed $261.1 million worldwide and lost $122.6 million, making it one of thebiggest box-office bombs of all time.
In 1998, three years after destroyingCyberdyne Systems,[a]SarahandJohn Connorhave retired toLivingston,Guatemala. They are suddenly ambushed by aT-800 Terminator, one of several sent back through time bySkynet, which kills John despite Sarah's attempts to stop it.
In 2020, an advanced Terminator, theRev-9, is sent back in time toMexico Cityto murder Dani Ramos, whilecyberneticallyenhanced soldier Grace is sent from 2042 to protect her. The Rev-9, disguised as Dani's father, infiltrates the automobile assembly plant where she and her brother Diego work, but is thwarted by Grace, who escapes with the siblings. The Rev-9, using its ability to split into its cybernetic endoskeleton andshape-shifting liquid metalexterior, pursues the trio, killing Diego and cornering Grace and Dani. However, Sarah arrives and temporarily disables both forms of the entity using military-grade weaponry. Grace and Dani steal Sarah's car to escape, but due to her enhanced cybernetic capabilities, Grace needs medicine or else she falls unconscious. Raiding a pharmacy, they get the medicine they need before Sarah catches up and guides them to a motel.
At the motel, Sarah reveals that she found them because in the years since John's death she has received encrypted messages detailing the locations of arriving Terminators, each ending with "For John", allowing her to destroy them before they become threats. Grace notes that Skynet and John do not exist in her future, meaning Sarah succeeded in destroying the former after Cyberdyne went defunct. However, humanity's future is threatened by anotherAIcalled Legion, originally developed forcyberwarfare, which was built in Skynet's place. When Legion became a threat to humans, an attempt was made to neutralize it withnuclear weapons, resulting in anuclear holocaustand the AI creating a global network of machines to terminate the human survivors, who organized a resistance movement to counter Legion's onslaughts, and Dani's destiny is linked to their war against it.
Grace traces the source of Sarah's messages toLaredo, Texas. Barely evading the Rev-9 and the authorities while crossing theMexico–United States border, they arrive at their source, where they discover the same T-800 that had killed John. Having fulfilled his mission and with Skynet no longer existing to give him further orders, the T-800 was left aimless. Over time and through his adaptability, he becameself-aware, learned from humanity, anddeveloped a conscience, taking the name "Carl" and adopting a human family. After learning how his actions affected Sarah and being able to detect the location of temporal displacements, Carl began to forewarn her of them to give her a purpose to make amends. Carl joins them against the Rev-9 and they prepare to destroy it, with Sarah begrudgingly agreeing to work together for Dani's sake. Anticipating the Rev-9's arrival, Carl bids his family farewell and tells them to escape.
The group seek out a military-gradeelectromagnetic pulse(EMP) generator from Air Force officer and acquaintance of Sarah's, Major Dean. The Rev-9 catches up with them, forcing them to steal a plane to escape, though the EMP generators are destroyed in the resulting shootout. During the flight, Grace reveals Dani will become the future founding commander of the resistance before the Rev-9 boards their airplane and temporarily subdues Carl, forcing the three women to parachute from the plane into a river near ahydroelectricplant, with Carl and the Rev-9 following close behind. Trapped, the group makes their stand inside the plant. In the ensuing battle, Carl and Grace force the Rev-9 into a spinning turbine, causing an explosion that critically damages the two Terminators. The severely damaged Rev-9 endoskeleton incapacitates Sarah, forcing Dani to confront it herself. A dying Grace tells Dani to use her power source to destroy it. Dani tries to fight the Rev-9 but is quickly overpowered. Carl reactivates himself and restrains it, allowing Dani to stab it with Grace's power source. He then drags himself and the Rev-9 over a ledge before the power core explodes, destroying them both.
Sometime later, Dani and Sarah watch a young Grace at a playground with her family, the former determined to avert Grace's death and Legion's rise, before driving off to prepare.
By December 2013,Skydance Productionswas planning forTerminator Genisysto be the start of anew trilogy of films.[22][23]TheGenisyssequels were scheduled for release on May 19, 2017 and June 29, 2018.[24][25]For the second film in the planned trilogy, actorArnold Schwarzeneggerwas to reprise his role as theT-800.[26]Terminator Genisyswas produced by Skydance founderDavid Ellisonand was released in 2015, but its disappointing box-office performance stalled the development of the planned trilogy.[27][28][29][30]Dana Goldberg, the chief creative officer for Skydance, said in October 2015 that she "wouldn't say [the franchise is] on hold, so much as re-adjusting". According to Goldberg, despiteGenisys'disappointing domestic performance, the company was happy with its worldwide numbers and still intended to make new films. Production of a sequel would begin no earlier than 2016 because the company planned market research to determine its direction afterGenisys.[29]TheGenisyssequels were ultimately canceled.[31][32]
Tim Millerand Ellison talked about Miller eventually directing a newTerminatorfilm after completingDeadpool 2(2018).[33][34]When Miller left theDeadpool 2project in October 2016,[35]he took on theTerminatorfilm as his next project instead.[33][34]At the request of Miller,[36]franchise creatorJames Cameronsubsequently joined the project. Cameron had directed and co-written the first twoTerminatorfilms,[37][38]and Miller, through his companyBlur Studio, had previously worked with Cameron.[39]Ellison felt thatGenisyscould have been better, so he recruited Cameron as a fellow producer in hopes of creating a better film.[40][41]Cameron was intrigued by Ellison's proposal to make a sequel toTerminator 2: Judgment Day(1991), ignoring the events ofTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines(2003),Terminator Salvation(2009), andTerminator Genisys.[41][42]Cameron said "we're pretending the other films were a bad dream. Or analternate timeline, which is permissible in ourmulti-verse."[33]Other filmmakers on the project had suggested making the film without Schwarzenegger, but Cameron disliked the idea as he and Schwarzenegger were friends.[43]Cameron agreed to produce the film on the condition that Schwarzenegger be involved.[44][45]As producer, Cameron was involved inpre-productionand script work,[41]and also provided his input on the project.[37]Miller felt that audiences had "lost hope" in the franchise following the last three films. He believed that Cameron's involvement would serve as a "seal of quality" which would convince fans that the franchise "was going to be handled at least in a way that the original filmmaker would want".[38]
Cameron was involved with the film as of January 2017 and Ellison was searching for a writer among science fiction authors with the intention that Miller direct.[46]Later in the month, Ellison said there would be an announcement regarding the future of the franchise before the end of the year, adding that it was going to be in a direction that would provide "the continuation of what the fans really wanted sinceT2".[47]In July 2017, Cameron said that he was working with Ellison to set up a trilogy of films and supervise them. The intention was for Schwarzenegger to be involved, but also to introduce new characters and "pass the baton".[48]
On September 12, 2017,Skydance Mediaconfirmed that Miller would direct the newTerminatorfilm,[49]which was initially scheduled for release on July 26, 2019.[50]The film's budget was approximately $185–$196 million,[51]split roughly three ways between Skydance,Paramount Picturesand20th Century Fox,[52]all of which were production companies for the film.[53]Chinese company,Tencent Picturesjoined the project as a co-financier in April 2018,[54]ultimately financing ten percent of the budget.[51]Tencent was a production company on the project,[53]and also handled the film's distribution, marketing and merchandising in China.[54]TSG Entertainmentand Cameron'sLightstorm Entertainmentwere also involved in the production.[53]
Before screenwriters were hired, Miller had asked that a group of novelists be consulted on how to reinvent the franchise.[55]Among the novelists wereJoe Abercrombie,Neal Asher,Greg Bear,Warren EllisandNeal Stephenson.[34]Abercrombie suggested the idea of a female character who is half human and half machine, forming the origins of the character Grace.[55]A human-machine character, Marcus Wright, was previously featured inTerminator Salvation, portrayed bySam Worthington.[56]
The film's story was conceived by Miller, Cameron and Ellison and a team of writers was hired to write the script. They includedCharles H. Eglee,David S. Goyerand his writing partner Justin Rhodes andJosh Friedman, creator of the television seriesTerminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.[41][57][58][34]Cameron and the writers watched theTerminatorsequels that came after his initial films. They determined that the storylines of the later films were too complex when it came to time travel.[41][42]Weeks were spent working on the story which was eventually envisioned as a newTerminatorfilm trilogy.[41][59][60]Goyer wrote a draft for the first film in the trilogy that would ultimately becomeTerminator: Dark Fate.[34]
Goyer moved on to other projects.[34]By November 2017,Billy Raywas brought in to polish the script.[57]Ray rewrote much of Goyer's draft. Miller wrote the film's action scenes, while Ray handled the characters.[34]Cameron had a list of action scenes, for no particular film, that he had wanted to shoot over the years. He gave this list to Miller, so he could work them intoTerminator: Dark Fate. The list formed the basis for scenes involving a dam and a Humvee underwater.[61]As the start of filming approached, Cameron felt that the script needed improvement and made the changes himself.[41]The film's story credits were given to James Cameron, Charles Eglee, Josh Friedman, David Goyer and Justin Rhodes; screenplay by David Goyer, Justin Rhodes and Billy Ray.[62]Cameron said that he and Miller ultimately had many disagreements about the film, but he described it as being part of the creative process.[37]Among their disagreements was whether the human resistance would be winning or losing to Legion in the future. Miller wanted the humans to be losing, while Cameron felt differently. Miller said, "Legion is so powerful, the only way to beat it is going back in time and strangle it in the crib. Jim says, 'What's dramatic about the humans losing?' And I say, 'Well, What's dramatic about the humans winning and they just need to keep on winning?' I like a last stand. It's not his thing." Miller also had disagreements with Ellison.[63][64]
Miller said that the destruction of Cyberdyne at the end ofTerminator 2: Judgment Dayis an event which would change the future "but no one knew how. And I don't think the movies that came after it really explored that in a clean way like I believe we are, with true consequences, and it makes perfect sense for Sarah to be the one to face those consequences since they were her choices to begin with."[65]One consequence would be the death of John Connor, who was initially meant to become the future leader of the human resistance against machines.[61]The decision to kill the John Connor character came from Cameron, who wanted to surprise audiences who had become invested in the character's mythology: "It's like, 'Let's just get that right off the table. Let's just pull the carpet out from underneath all of our assumptions of what a Terminator movie is going to be about. Let's just put a bullet in his head at a pizzeria in the first 45 seconds.'"[66]Cameron said that John's death serves as "a springboard for the story to show Sarah's ultimate trauma from which she only begins to recover right at the end of the new film. She's driven by hatred, by revenge. (...) Her badassery comes from a place of deep hurt and deep pain."[66]
Miller said that he and the other filmmakers did not find the decision to kill John controversial. Miller felt that Sarah Connor was best portrayed as an unhappy character and he said that John's death provided a reason for her to be that way.[61]Miller said of Sarah Connor: "Grief has made her want to be an emotionless killing machine. And at the end of the movie, she's allowing herself to care again, she comes back to humanity. Her shriveled heart has blossomed again. That was the journey". However, Miller did not want Sarah Connor to be an unpleasant and "unwatchable" character and said, "I think Sarah is tough, but it's not uncomfortable to watch."[34]
Cameron believed that removing John Connor would prevent the film from feeling like a retread of previous films.[67]Discarding John Connor allowed for new characters to be worked into the story. Miller said, "You can't have John be a 36-year-old accountant somewhere. And really, when you think about it, he could be sort of a pathetic figure as a man who had missed his moment in history and was relegated to this banal, ordinary existence". Describing the opening scene, Miller said, "You want to slap the audience in the face and say, 'Wake up. This is going to be different.' I feel like that accomplished that. I hate the violence of it. I hate the idea of a kid being shot, but the dramatic fuel that it gives the story is kind of undeniable." In the early stages of development, there was consideration given to the idea that Dani Ramos could be portrayed as John's daughter, or that she could have some other connection to the Connors. However, Miller disliked the idea that she would be related to them.[61]There were never plans to feature John Connor in any other scenes besides the opening.[66]Linda Hamiltonwas somewhat shocked by the decision to kill John Connor, which she believed would upset a lot of fans, but she also said she wanted the film series and its characters to evolve.[67][68]She was pleased with the film's characters, feeling that earlier sequels toTerminator 2lacked characters the audience would care about.[69]
Miller was dissatisfied with the final film's idea that Dani would send Grace to the past, saying, "We set up this whole [story] where Grace is kind of Dani's surrogate child and a mother sending her child to die for her is just...yeah, I had a different scene in mind."[70]Additionally, several endings were considered, including one where Sarah and Dani would bury Grace and another where Grace's body would be burned and sent down a river. Eventually, Miller suggested the idea that Dani would go to see the younger Grace. The ending playground scene was a late addition to the film.[70]
Cameron devised the idea of a T-800 Terminator that is "just out there in this kind of limbo" for more than 20 years after carrying out an order, becoming more human "in the sense that he's evaluating the moral consequences of things that he did, that he was ordered to do back in his early days, and really kind of developing a consciousness and a conscience". Cameron considered this iteration of the character to be more interesting than those featured in his first two films, saying, "We've seen the Terminator that was programmed to be bad; you've seen the one that was programmed to be good, to be a protector. But in both cases, neither one of them have free will."[37]Schwarzenegger enjoys interior decorating, so Cameron suggested that his T-800 character in the film have a drapery business.[71][72][73]Miller arranged the script's structure to have Schwarzenegger's character appear later in the story, to allow time for the three female lead characters to develop.[74]
By April 2017, Schwarzenegger had joined the project to reprise his role.[75][76]That September, it was announced Hamilton would reprise her role as Sarah Connor, whom she previously portrayed in the first two films.[77]Hamilton had also briefly reprised the role for the 1996 theme park attractionT2-3D: Battle Across Time,[78]and provided her voice in an uncredited role forTerminator Salvation.[79]Because previousTerminatorfilms did not do well with audiences, Miller felt it was necessary to have Hamilton reprise the role.[65][80]Cameron, Ellison and Miller only wanted to bring back the Sarah Connor character if Hamilton would reprise the role. The film's storyline was devised first so the trio would have an idea to pitch to Hamilton.[41]Cameron said that he sent Hamilton a "long rambling email with a lot of reasons why she should do it and a lot of reasons why she shouldn't". Cameron's main reason why Hamilton should return was that people liked her in the role.[40]There was never a version of the film that excluded Hamilton and Miller said there was no backup plan in the event that she declined the role.[81]
After approximately six weeks,[82]Hamilton chose to sign on to the film,[65]which did not yet have a completed script for her to read; that was still being refined.[83]Initially, Hamilton was unsure if she wanted to reprise the role.[84]She had been semi-retired from acting,[85]and said, "I didn't want it to look like a shameless money grab. I am living this quiet, lovely life that doesn't involve being a celebrity, and you really have to think, do I really want to trade that in again for another15 minutes?"[82]Because so much time had passed since her last appearance as Sarah Connor, Hamilton had assumed that she would never reprise the role and she was surprised by the offer to do so.[65]Of her decision to return Hamilton said, "I was very pleased that all of the years had passed, because I could fill the years up with so much backstory and inner life that could power the character."[83]
Hamilton spent more than a year working with a fitness trainer to get into physical shape for the role.[83][65][86]Hamilton said she put 10 times more effort into her physique than she did forTerminator 2. This included a regimen of supplements andbioidentical hormones, as well as training withGreen Berets.[87][88]She also took weapons training.[89]Commenting on Hamilton's role, Cameron said he liked the idea of an action film starring a 62-year-old actress.[90][91]Hamilton chose to dye her hair gray for the film, as she wanted viewers to see her character as an old woman.[92]Hamilton disliked the physical training,[93]and she had suggested that her character be portrayed as a fat person so she would not have to train for the film, although the idea was rejected.[94][89]
In March 2018, it was announced thatMackenzie Davishad been cast in the film.[6]Miller said of Davis, "I didn't just want a woman who could physically fit the role but emotionally as well. Mackenzie really wanted to do it; she came after the role. She worked harder than anybody."[55]After Davis was cast, she undertook physical training for the film's fight scenes.[95][96]Schwarzenegger andGabriel Lunaalso underwent physical training for the film.[97]Luna was first considered for a role in December 2017, when a four-month casting process began for him.[98]
The production team wanted to cast an 18-to-20-year-old woman as the new centerpiece of the story.[77]Hamilton rehearsed lines with several actresses who were auditioning for the role of Dani and she immediately felt thatNatalia Reyeswas the right choice.[99]When Reyes sent in an audition tape, all she knew about the project was that it was a "big American movie". She soon had a meeting with Miller throughSkype, before coming to Los Angeles to audition with Hamilton. For her next audition, Reyes was flown toDublinto audition with Davis, who was there shooting another film. The casting process lasted a month and a half for Reyes before she was finally cast. Afterwards, she went through physical training to prepare for the role.[100]
Because the film is partially set in Mexico City, the cast includes several Latino actors,[101][102]including Reyes, Luna andDiego Boneta, who were cast as primary characters in April 2018.[8]Reyes said, "This movie is a reflection ofHollywoodnow. We are just changing these stereotypes and the ideas and the cliches of what a Latino should be."[101]Cameron watched all the audition tapes and gave his approval to the casting choices.[100]By June 2018, Jude Collie had been cast as the double for a young John Connor, with Brett Azar reprising his role fromGenisysas the body double for a younger T-800.[18]
Cameron announced in July 2019 thatEdward Furlongwould reprise his role as John Connor fromTerminator 2: Judgment Day.[20]Furlong later maintained that his role in the film was small,[103]and Miller regretted that Cameron had made such an announcement.[104]Furlong's likeness was used to recreate his younger face digitally using CGI. He also gave a performance throughfacial motion capturefootage tode-agehim that was added into the film.[66][19][104]For his performance, Furlong simultaneously watched footage of Collie during the film's opening scene and had to match his own performance with Collie's precisely.[105]Furlong is credited as "John Connor reference".[16]Furlong was disappointed by his small role, which was limited to one day of work.[17]
Production was intended to start initially in March 2018, but was delayed due to casting. It was then expected to start during May and end during November with filming taking place inHungary, theUnited Kingdom,SpainandMexico.[106]In April 2018, the film's release date was delayed until November 2019.[107]Filming began in Spain on June 4, 2018, under the working titleTerminator 6: Phoenix.[14][108][109]Filming subsequently moved to Hungary and the United States,[110]before concluding in November 2018.[111]
The film, like Cameron's initialTerminatorfilms, israted R, whereas the previous two films were rated PG-13.[112][113][41]Miller said the film is rated R because "the fans kind of demanded it, in a way", saying that "the DNA of Terminator" is an R-rated movie and that "to not do it R feels disingenuous to the source material".[45][114]Initially, certain scenes were filmed in two ways—with and without R-rated violence and language. This gave the filmmakers an alternative in the event that the film's intended R rating should be reconsidered. The filmmakers eventually abandoned this method after deciding definitively on an R-rated film.[41][59]
During filming, Cameron made further changes to the script to perfect the characters. In some cases, his script changes were submitted to Miller only a day prior to filming the scene.[41]Hamilton rejected certain actions and lines of dialogue that she felt were uncharacteristic for Sarah Connor.[83][93][115]Schwarzenegger also added and changed some of his own lines during filming.[92]Cameron did not visit the set, as he was busy filming hisAvatarsequels.[41]He also did not want to interfere with Miller's directorial work.[37]
The first day of filming took place inIsleta del Moro,Almería, Spain.[116][117]It involved the pivotal opening scene featuring the characters of the T-800, Sarah Connor and John Connor. The three characters were portrayed in the scene by body doubles and digitalde-agingwas later applied to give them a youthful appearance. The doubles wore special hoods that tracked their head movements, allowing their facial features to be replaced later by new motion capture facial footage recorded by Schwarzenegger, Hamilton and Furlong.[104][92][118]
During filming of the opening scene, Hamilton expressed dissatisfaction with the body double's portrayal, feeling that it did not accurately reflect the character. Hamilton advised the body double on how to portray the character for a more fierce response to the T-800 character. Hamilton was disappointed that she had no onscreen part in the scene and later said, "It wasn't me and it really hurt. I cried my eyes out when I got home."[92][119]The film used morestuntwomenfor Sarah Connor thanTerminator 2. Hamilton said she "really got a little crazy trying to micromanage" them to ensure that they moved the way her character should. For this reason, Hamilton performed some of her own stunts.[120]
Scenes that were set in Mexico were shot entirely in Spain, where filming lasted approximately 30 days.[121]Spain was chosen for budgetary reasons and because of safety concerns overdrug cartelviolence in Mexico. Filming locations included the Madrid neighborhoods ofPueblo NuevoandLavapiés, which stood in as Mexican towns. For these scenes, the film crew repainted cars to resemble taxis and also left old vehicles on the streets to suggest they were abandoned.[122]An artist was also hired to paint graffiti art to further give the location a Mexican appearance. Boneta, who was born and raised in Mexico City, was asked to meet with the film's art department leaders to ensure that the filming locations in Spain had an authentic Mexican look.[123]While filming in Spain, Luna coached several actors on how to speak Spanish with a Mexican accent.[101]
In July 2018, filming took place for two weeks inCatral, including the San Juan industrial estate.[124]Filming also took place inCartagena,[125]and at theAldeadávila Dam.[124]A combination of practical effects and CGI were used for a highway chase sequence in which the Rev-9 pursues Grace, Dani and Diego.[126]Sarah Connor's present-day introduction also takes place on the highway and Hamilton rehearsed the scene extensively before it was filmed.[127]Approximately seven freeway locations in Spain had been considered before settling on the final choice,[123]consisting of new roads leading to the then-unopenedRegión de Murcia International Airport.[124][128]
The highway chase sequence required a crew of approximately 300 people, with many different film departments involved. A custom-built pod car, similar to adune buggy, was built to haul a pickup truck during filming. This allowed Davis, Reyes and Boneta to act out their scenes in the truck while the driving was handled by a professional driver in the pod car. Cameras were attached to the pickup truck to film the actors while the vehicle was in motion.[123]One shot filmed at the San Juan industrial estate depicts the Rev-9 driving its plow truck through a wall, which was built specifically for the shot.[128]The highway chase was initially planned to be twice as long. The Rev-9 was to have killed a cop and stolen a motorcycle to continue its pursuit and the motorcycle would be shot at and destroyed. The Rev-9 would subsequently leap onto a truck and then onto Dani's vehicle. The extended sequence was previsualized, but Miller chose not to film it as the sequence was considered "crazy" enough already. Previously, Miller had wanted to film the motorcycle sequence for his 2016 filmDeadpool.[61]
Filming moved to Hungary on July 19, 2018.[110]Filming locations there included Origo Film Studios inBudapest.[129][130][131][132]Part of the film'sC-5plane sequence involves the characters floating in thefuselagein zero gravity. Miller spoke with pilots to do research into gravity and the plane's action scenes, which were difficult to choreograph because of the constant gravity changes depicted.[123]Hamilton said the film's script was the first one that she did not fully understand, because of the large amount of action. Animatedprevisualizationaided the cast during such scenes.[92][93]In Budapest, special effects supervisorNeil Corbouldcreated the film's largest set piece: the fuselage of the C-5. The set was constructed on an 85-tongimbal, the largest ever built. The set was capable of rotating 360 degrees and could tilt backwards and forwards at 10 degrees. It was powered by five 200-liter-per-minutehydraulic pumps, as well as more than a mile and a half ofhydraulic hoses. A pit had to be dug in the concrete floor of thesound stageto accommodate the large set, which took approximately five months to design and another five months to build. The set was 60 feet long, half the length of a real C-5 fuselage and it contained abluescreenat one end for post-production effects to be added in later. The rotating set helped to achieve the sense of gravity needed for the scene and the set also allowed the camera crew members to strap themselves inside. The plane set was padded for actors who shot scenes inside it. Foam replicas of military vehicles were also situated inside the plane with the actors.[123][133]
Davis said shooting the film was "the hardest thing" she had ever done because of the physical requirements.[134]One scene depicts a Humvee falling out of the C-5 plane, with Grace having to open the vehicle's parachutes to land it safely. Davis was suspended with wires to perform the scene, which was filmed in Budapest.[135]An underwater action scene took weeks to shoot and involved immersing Hamilton and Reyes in a water tank.[92]The scene depicts Sarah and Dani inside the Humvee after it falls over the dam and into water. The scene was shot in a tank surrounded by a large bluescreen stage which depicted the exterior environment. For the scene, each day of shooting took place over 12-hour periods from the evening to the morning. Another scene depicts the T-800 and Rev-9 fighting underwater.[100][136]
The film includes a scene where the characters are held in a detention center on theMexico–United States border. Miller said it was not meant as asocial commentaryorpolitical statementon immigrant issues related to the border,[34][38][137]stating that the scene was "just a natural evolution of the story". He noted: "I tried to walk a line there because it's a terrible situation, but I didn't want to vilify border guards. They're people doing a job. The system is the problem. And even the choice to do it really wasn't a statement. It really was a function of us putting the story's beginning in central Mexico and then traveling."[34]Miller was emotional while filming the scene because of its depiction of immigrants being held in a detention center.[92][138]Luna said, "We don't make any overt political stances; we just show you what's happening in the world and you receive it however as you may."[138]Scenes at the detention center were filmed in July 2018, at an oldNokiafactory in the Hungarian city ofKomárom.[123][139][140]
In late July 2018, Schwarzenegger began filming scenes in Budapest.[141]In September 2018, filming took place at aMercedes-Benzfactory inKecskemét.[110]Filming in the United States was scheduled to begin in mid-October.[110]Carl's cabin was built from scratch. While the filmmakers liked the surrounding scenery, they rejected a previous house that was built on the property for another production, so it was torn down to construct the new home.[123]Schwarzenegger completed filming on October 28, 2018.[142]Filming wrapped in early November 2018.[111]
Cameron, who also works as a film editor, was heavily involved in the editing ofTerminator: Dark Fate. He saw arough cutof the film in early 2019 and provided Miller with notes on how to improve it feeling it needed to be perfected. He said the film "transformed quite a bit" from the rough cut.[37]The initial cut of the film, known as anassembly cut, was two hours and 50 minutes. Miller'sdirector's cutwas closer to the film's final runtime. Three or four minutes were removed from the director's cut, including a few scenes. Some scenes were also trimmed, including the underwater fight and those on board the C-5 airplane.[143]In his director's cut, Miller said he removed "a lot of stuff" that Cameron thought was important. Miller also said that he and Cameron had many disagreements about lines of dialogue which Miller thought were "poetic and beautiful", while Cameron thought they were unimportant. Because of the lack of full control throughout the project, Miller said he would likely not work with Cameron again, although the two maintained a good relationship.[63]The final cut of the film runs for 128 minutes.[144]
At one point late in production, Miller considered placing the opening scene later in the film, when Sarah is in the motel room explaining John's death to Grace and Dani. However, Miller said this structure "really changed a whole lot of stuff in a negative way" and he ultimately decided to keep it as an opening scene, in order to start the film off by shocking the audience.[74]The opening scene was originally longer as it featured dialogue between Sarah and John. This was cut from the final film as Cameron and Miller believed that the visual effects did not hold up well when the characters spoke.[66][104]Another deleted scene went into more detail on how Carl knew about other Terminators arriving from the future. The scene, written by Cameron, explained that Carl created a cell phone app to track the arrivals, which disrupt cell phone signals. The scene was removed because it was considered too humorous compared to the rest of the sequence, which has a serious tone as it involves Sarah meeting her son's killer.[70]A shot was deleted from Carl's final fight with the Rev-9 that depicted it ripping flesh off of Carl's arm. Miller said, "We had to walk the line between gross and horrific" and he described the arm skin as "hanging like a big piece of jerky", saying, "That's where we drew the line."[145]
The film contains 2,600 visual effects shots and was edited usingAdobe Premiere ProandAdobe After Effects.[146]The visual effects were provided byIndustrial Light & Magic(ILM) andScanline VFX, supervised by Alex Wang, David Seager, Arek Komorowski.Eric Barbawas the production supervisor with help fromBlur Studio,Digital Domain,Method Studios, Unit Image, Rebellion VFX, Mammal Studios, Universal Production Partners (UPP),[147]Weta Digital,[148]Les Androïds Associés,The Third Floor, Inc.andCantina Creative.[149]ILM was initially going to be the sole company working on visual effects, but others were brought on due to the amount of work that had to be done on the film. The Third Floor handled some of the previsualization.[150]Method Studios created visual effects for scenes involving the C-5 airplane and a helicopter crash. The company also created anestablishing shotof a military base and several shots set during the border crossing.[151]Blur Studio handled scenes that depict Grace's future as a soldier.[123]
ILM handled the de-aging in the opening scene.[118]ILM's visual effects supervisor,Jeff White, said a lot of work went into the scene to ensure that the characters' faces looked realistic and had the same likenesses asTerminator 2.[150]After seeing the digital head shots, Schwarzenegger provided guidance to the ILM team, which made subtle adjustments to perfect his character's facial movements. The ILM team also created the liquid metal effects of the Rev-9. The team studiedtime-lapse photographywhich depicted the growth of algae and fungus and this inspired the liquid metal movements.[152]
According to Cameron in February 2019, the film'sworking titlewasTerminator: Dark Fate.[153]This was confirmed as the film's official title the following month.[154]
Tom Holkenborgcomposed the film's score, reuniting with director Tim Miller after their collaboration inDeadpool.[155]Holkenborg recreatedBrad Fiedel's original "Terminator" theme while also introducing Latino elements to reflect the ethnicity of Dani Ramos. He used approximately 15 instruments while composing the score and also used the sound of ananviland the banging of a washing machine, describing his score as being "way more aggressive" than Fiedel's.[156]The soundtrack was released digitally on November 1, 2019, byParamount Music.
A first-look promotional image showing Hamilton, Davis and Reyes was released in August 2018. It was the subject of comments which criticized the absence of the Terminator and John Connor and received backlash for its focus on the female cast members.[157][158][159]A teaser trailer for the film was released on May 23, 2019,[160]that features a cover version ofBjörk's "Hunter" performed byJohn Mark McMillan.[161][162]The film's theatrical and international trailers were released on August 29, 2019.[163][164]The trailers' release date marked the anniversary of the original Judgment Day date given in the second film.[165]Initially, the marketing campaign highlighted the return of Cameron and Hamilton. In the final months, the campaign focused more on the film's action and special effects. Promotional partners includedAdobe Inc.andRuffles.[166]In September 2019, Adobe andParamount Pictureslaunched a contest for people to create their own remix version of the trailer using Adobe software and assets from the film.[167]
In early October 2019, brief footage of the film was shown duringIMAXscreenings ofJoker. Miller and the cast went on a global press tour to promote the film and Hamilton attended a premiere event inSeoulon October 21, 2019.[166]
In the film, Schwarzenegger's character has a van which advertises "Carl's Draperies 888-512-1984" on the side of it. The number was an actual phone number which, when dialed, plays a recording of Schwarzenegger as Carl. The number references May 12, 1984, the date thatKyle Reesetime-travels to in the first film.[168][169]
Terminator: Dark Fatewas theatrically released in Europe on October 23, 2019[170]and was also theatrically released on November 1, 2019 byParamount Picturesin the United States and Canada and20th Century Foxinternationally.[171][172]On October 19, 2019,Alamo Drafthouse Cinemahosted surprise screenings of the film in 15 theaters, disguised as screenings ofTerminator 2: Judgment Day(1991).[173]The premiere event forTerminator: Dark Fatein the United States was to be held on October 28, 2019 atTCL Chinese TheatreinHollywood, Los Angeles, but it was canceled because of thenearby wildfires.[174][175]
Terminator: Dark Fatewas released digitally on January 14, 2020, before its home video releases on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD on January 28.[176]Several deleted scenes were included with the home video release, including one in which Sarah learns that Carl has informed Alicia of his past and his true nature as a killing machine.[177]In another scene, Sarah hijacks a man's vehicle on the highway after Grace and Dani steal hers.[178]Another scene depicts the characters being attacked by guards as they journey towards the border.[179]One deleted scene depicts Grace volunteering herself to an older Dani to send her to the past.[70][180]
On December 15, 2024, the film was released onNetflix.
Terminator: Dark Fategrossed $62.3 million in the United States and Canada and $198.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $261.1 million.[181]With a production budget between $185–196 million and an additional $80–100 million spent on marketing and distribution, early estimates stated the film needed to earn over $450 million worldwide to break even.[51][182]The film ended up losing Paramount, Skydance and other studios $122.6 million.[183]It was labeled abox-office bombafter its dismal opening weekend,[184][185]and it finished as the second biggest bomb of 2019.[183]As a result of the losses, sources close to Skydance said shortly after the release that there were no plans to continue the franchise.[186]
In the United States and Canada,Dark Fatewas released at the same time asHarriet,Arctic DogsandMotherless Brooklynand was initially projected to gross $40–47 million from 4,086 theaters in its opening weekend.[187]The film made $2.35 million from Thursday night previews, on a par with the $2.3 million thatGenisysmade from its Tuesday night previews in 2015, but after making just $10.6 million on its first day, weekend estimates were lowered to $27 million. It went on to debut to $29 million. Although it finished first at the box office, it was the lowest opening in the series since the original film (when accounting for inflation), which was blamed on the lukewarm critical reception, as well as the audience's disinterest in anotherTerminatorfilm.[51]The film made $10.8 million in its second weekend, dropping 63% and finishing fifth and then $4.3 million in its third weekend, falling to 11th.[188][189]
In Germany, the film started out with 132,500 viewers, placing it third on that week's charts.[190]In the weekend following its international debut, the film grossed $12.8 million from countries in Europe and Asia, considered a low start.[191][192]The film was projected to gross $125 million globally during the first weekend of November 2019.[52]Instead, it only made $101.9 million (18% below projections), including $72.9 million overseas. As it did in the U.S., the film under-performed in China, where it opened to just $28.2 million, far below the $40–50 million estimates.[51][193]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 70% of 351 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's consensus reads: "Terminator: Dark Faterepresents a significant upgrade over its immediate predecessors, even if it lacks the thrilling firepower of the franchise's best installments."[194]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[195]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as its three immediate predecessors, while those atPostTrakgave it an overall positive score of 78%, with 51% saying they would definitely recommend it.[51]
The Hollywood Reporterwrote that critics overall seemed "cautiously excited aboutDark Fate, although there's a certain awkwardness about seeing repeated recommendations that it is 'easily the third-best' movie in the series".[196]William Bibbiani ofTheWrapwrote that, "WhetherTerminator: Dark Fateis the last chapter in this story or the first in an all-new franchise is, for now, irrelevant. The film works either way, bringing the tale of the first two films to a satisfying conclusion while reintroducing the classic storyline, in exciting new ways, to an excited new audience. It's a breathtaking blockbuster, and a welcome return to form."[197]Variety'sOwen Gleibermancalled the film "the first vitalTerminatorsequel sinceTerminator 2" and wrote that "Terminator: Dark Fateis a movie designed to impress you with its scale and visual effects, but it's also a film that returns, in good and gratifying ways, to the smartly packaged low-down genre-thriller classicism that gave the originalTerminatorits kick."[53]
Joe MorgensternofThe Wall Street Journalgave the film a negative review, describing it as "cobbled together by dunces in a last-ditch effort to wring revenue from a moribund concept. The plot makes no sense—time travel as multiverse Dada. Worse still, it renders meaningless the struggles that gave the first two films of the franchise an epic dimension."[198]Jefferey M. Anderson ofCommon Sense Mediagave the movie two out of five stars: "This sixthTerminatormovie erases the events of the previous three (dud) sequels but winds up feeling half-erased itself. It's like a dull, pale, irrelevant carbon copy of a once glorious hit."[199]Christy LemireofRogerEbert.comgaveDark Fatetwo out of four stars, arguing that it suffered from "empty fanservice" and that Hamilton "deserves better" as does her supporting female cast.[200]David Ehrlich ofIndieWirepraised Hamilton's performance and the movie's digital recreations of her, Furlong's and Schwarzenegger's younger likenesses, but concluded that "this painfully generic action movie proves that theTerminatorfranchise is obsolete".[201]Tasha Robinson ofThe Vergestated that some combat sequences "are staged clearly and cleanly", while others "are packed with CGI blurs and muddy action and are hard to follow in even the most basic 'who's where, and are they dead?' kind of way. And whenDark Fatedoes deign to explain what's going on, it delivers its exposition in a self-important, hushed, clumsy way, as if audiences should be astonished by the most basic plot revelations."[202]
Peter BradshawofThe Guardianawarded it two stars out of five, stating "TheTerminatorfranchise has come clanking robotically into view once again with its sixth film – it absolutely will not stop – not merely repeating itself but somehow repeating the repetitions." While he wrote that it was "good to see Hamilton getting a robust role", he added that "sadly, she has to concede badass superiority to Davis." He concluded by writing, "This sixthTerminatorsurely has to be the last. Yet the very nature of theTerminatorstory means that going round and round in existential circles comes with the territory."[203]Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesawarded the film two stars out of four, calling it a "boring retread" and "so derivative ofJudgment Day", although he welcomed the return of Linda Hamilton, praised an "impressively effective" Mackenzie Davis and the "winning screen presence" of Natalia Reyes."[204]Angie Han ofMashablefound the film underwhelming and its title to be quite apt: "Dark Fateis too thinly sketched to be anything but pastiche. It feels like aTerminatormovie spit out by a machine designed to makeTerminatormovies. A dark fate for the franchise, indeed."[205]
Regarding the film's mixed reception, Tim Miller believed that some audiences were predisposed to dislike the film after being disappointed by the last three films, adding that some audiences "hate it because it's the sixth movie, and Hollywood should be making original movies and not repeating franchises".[38]Miller later gave a more blunt assessment in 2022: "Terminator's an interesting movie to explore, but maybe we've explored it enough. I went in with the rock hard nerd belief that if I made a good movie that I wanted to see, it would do well. And I was wrong. It was one of those f**king Eureka moments in a bad way because the movie tanked."[206]
James Cameron reflected onDark Fatein 2022: "I'm actually reasonably happy with the film ... I think the problem, and I'm going to wear this one, is that I refused to do it without Arnold ... And then Tim wanted Linda. I think what happened is I think the movie could have survived having Linda in it, I think it could have survived having Arnold in it, but when you put Linda and Arnold in it and then, you know, she's 60-something, he's 70-something, all of a sudden it wasn't yourTerminatormovie, it wasn't even your dad'sTerminatormovie, it was your granddad'sTerminatormovie. And we didn't see that ... it was just our own myopia. We kind of got a little high on our own supply and I think that's the lesson there."[207]
Schwarzenegger also gave a blunt assessment in a 2023 interview about the franchise: "The first three movies were great. Number four [Salvation] I was not in because I was governor. Then five [Genisys] and six [Dark Fate] didn't close the deal as far as I'm concerned. We knew that ahead of time because they were just not well written."[208]
The death ofJohn Connorearly in the film was criticized by both critics and fans.[209][210]Fred Hawson ofNews.ABS-CBN.comwrote that "deciding to lose John Connor early on in this one made the emotional heart of the first two classicTerminatorfilms stop beating as well."[211]Richard Roeperargued that killing John Connor ruined what the previous two films established: "Even thoughDark Fatetosses aside the third, fourth and fifth entries in the series like a Terminator disposing of a hapless cop, it also undercuts the impact of the first film and the follow-up (which is one of the two or three greatest sequels of all time). First, they get rid of the John Connor character in almost casual fashion."[204]
Corey Plante ofInverse, who was critical of Furlong's portrayal of the character inTerminator 2, nonetheless found his character's death off-putting: "The character at the focus of every previousTerminatormovie—the same young boy I irrationally hated since I was a young boy myself—was dead. Needless to say, it rattled me."[212]He also found that replacing him with new heroes undermined the Connors' importance established in the previous films: "The future that made [Sarah Connor] important died with John, and now there's a newTerminatorstory with a new set of heroes that makes it seem like no matter how many times Skynet or its next iteration sends a murder robot back in time to kill someone, there will always be a new hero waiting to rise up."[212]Robert Yaniz Jr. ofCheatSheetdescribed the twist as unthinkable: "In an instant, the entire crux of the franchise—the human resistance led by John—is torn away."[213]
Matt Goldberg ofColliderfelt the opening did irreparable damage to the legacy ofTerminator 2by rendering it pointless: "Every sequel since has diminished the ending ofJudgment Daybecause the story 'needs' to continue (because studios like money and can't leave well enough alone). ButTerminator: Dark Fatemay be the worst offender thus far as its prologue directly followsT2and goes for shock value rather than considering what it means to continue the narrative."[214]Richard Trenholm ofCNETfelt the opening twist summed up everything wrong withDark Fate: "The joy [of seeing the de-aged characters] instantly becomes cringeworthy, as this prologue underminesTerminator 2by killing a major character in such a cursory fashion it just feels silly."[215]Ian Sandwell ofDigital Spysuggested that the twist was not particularly important, given that in the other films, John Connor only exists to "motivate the other characters and sets the plot in motion" and that John's role as a future leader had already been rendered moot through the elimination of Skynet.[209]
About the controversial scene, Furlong also expressed his displeasure and hoped to reprise the role in full in a future film.[216]Linda Hamilton also voiced her opinion that the scene would upset fans, as she considered John to be the true main protagonist of the franchise.[217]Nick Stahl, who portrayed John inTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines, also expressed interest in reprising the role in a possible seventh film.[218]
Cathal Gunning ofScreen Rantnoted the similarity between the decision to kill off John Connor in the opening scene to the deaths of Newt and Corporal Dwayne Hicks inAlien 3, which was criticized by Cameron, who had directed the preceding film,Aliens.[219]
Terminator: Dark Fatereceived a nomination forOutstanding Special (Practical) Effects in a Photoreal or Animated Projectat the18th Visual Effects Society Awards.[220]At the 2020Dragon Awards, the film received a nomination for Best Science Fiction or Fantasy Movie.[221]It was nominated in two categories at the 2021Golden Trailer Awards: "Talk" (Create Advertising Group) for Best Action and "Non Stop" (Aspect Ratio) for Best Home Ent Action.[222]Terminator: Dark Fatereceived threeSaturn Awardnominations forBest Science Fiction Film,Best Supporting Actress(for Hamilton) andBest Special Effectsin2021.[223][224]
The 2019 video gameGears 5allows the player to play as either Sarah Connor with Hamilton voicing her character, Grace or a T-800 Terminator model. The game was released on September 6, 2019.[225]The T-800 model was later adownloadableplayable character inMortal Kombat 11, using Schwarzenegger's likeness, but without the actor voicing the character; he was voiced byChris Coxinstead of Schwarzenegger. The downloadable content was released on October 8, 2019.[226][227][228]
Amobile game, titledTerminator: Dark Fate – The Game, was released in October 2019.[229]
The PC game,Terminator: Dark Fate – Defiance,  developed bySlitherine Softwarein collaboration with Skydance,[230]was released on February 21, 2024.[231]It is areal-time tacticsgame that takes place ten years after theJudgment Day, during the war between humans and Legion.[232][233]The player assumes the role of Lieutenant Alex Church, a commander of the Founders, a group consisting of ex-U.S. military personnel. A multiplayer mode features two other playable factions: Movement (a humanresistance organization) and Legion.[231][234]The game received "mixed or average" reviews according toMetacritic, with a score of 72 out of 100.[235]Alex Avard ofEmpirefound the quality ofTerminatorgames to be inconsistent, but wrote thatDark Fate – Defiance, with its "tightly designed" gameplay, "may have just helped to raise that historically low bar a little bit higher."[236]Jon Bolding ofIGNcriticized the game's difficulty.[237]
National Entertainment Collectibles Associationreleased action figures based on the film and Chronicle Collectibles released an 18-inch T-800 statue.[238]
Plans for a newTerminatorfilm trilogy were announced in July 2017.[48]While working on the story forTerminator: Dark Fatethat year, Cameron and the writers envisioned the film as the first in the new trilogy. They also worked out the basic storylines for each planned film.[41][59][60][239]In October 2019, Cameron said that sequels toTerminator: Dark Fatewould further explore the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence, while stating that a resolution between the two feuding sides would be the ultimate outcome.[239][240]That month, Schwarzenegger said that Cameron would write theTerminator: Dark Fatesequels and that Cameron would begin work on the next film in early 2020, for release in 2022.[241]
Although the events ofTerminator: Dark Fateerase Schwarzenegger's T-800 character from existence, Cameron did not rule out the possibility of Schwarzenegger reprising the character, saying, "Look, if we make a ton of money with this film [Dark Fate] and the cards say that they like Arnold, I think Arnold can come back. I'm a writer. I can think of scenarios. We don't have a plan for that right now, let me put it that way."[37]Hamilton said in October 2019 that she would probably reprise her role for a sequel,[242]although she joked that she would fake her own death to avoid appearing in it, saying that makingTerminator: Dark Fate"really was hard" because of the physical training she had to undergo.[243][244]In April 2024, Hamilton confirmed that she was done with the role.[245]
Following the film's performance at the box office, sources close to Skydance toldThe Hollywood Reporterthat there are no plans for further films.[186]In June 2020, star Mackenzie Davis expressed: "I really loved the movie and I'm so proud of what we did, but there wasn't a demand for it [at the box office] and to think that there'd be a demand for a seventh film is quite insane. You should just pay attention to what audiences want".[246]Later in December, Davis went on to reveal that the seventh film would not have been a sequel toDark Fate, but a spin-off focusing on an alternate timeline version of Grace set in the future war similar toTerminator Salvationand would not have featured Schwarzenegger.[247]
It was later reported in May 2023 that Cameron was developing a script for aTerminatorreboot.[248]

She studied for two years atWashington CollegeinChestertown, Maryland, before moving on to acting studies in New York City.[8]Hamilton has said that her acting professor at Washington College told her she had no hope of earning a living as an actress.[9]In New York, she attended acting workshops given byLee Strasberg.[3]
Hamilton made her professional debut at age 23 with a small part in the 1979 dramaNight-Flowers. Her first major role came the following year when she appeared as Lisa Rogers on the short-livedCBSsoap operaSecrets of Midland Heights(December 1980–January 1981). She appeared in her first starring film role in the low-budget thrillerTAG: The Assassination Game(1982), and co-starred that same year in the made-for-television movieCountry Gold. She was listed as one of twelve "Promising New Actors of 1982" inJohn A. Willis'Screen World, Vol. 34.[10]
Hamilton made two prominent film appearances in 1984: firstly, a starring role inChildren of the Corn, a horror film based on the short story byStephen King. Hamilton played Vicky Baxter, a motorist who runs into trouble while travelling with her boyfriend through rural Nebraska. The film was financially profitable, making US$14 million at the domestic box office against a budget of US$3 million,[11]but received generally negative reviews.[12]In a more positive assessment byThe New York Times, Hamilton's performance was praised.[13]Her next role was co-starring inJames Cameron's science fiction action filmThe Terminator(1984) asSarah Connor, a young waitress—and soon-to-be mother ofa valiant resistance leader—who finds herself at the center of a nightmarish ordeal when a soldier travels back in time to help her defeatthe titular cyborg assassin, sent from the future to execute her. The film was a surprise commercial hit,[14]topping the U.S. box office for two weeks.[15]Critics believed it to be a perfect example of its genre,[16]with some attributing its strength to Hamilton's performance;The Hollywood Reporterwrote that she displayed "tremendous resiliency" as Connor,[17]whileJanet Maslinfelt she played the part "engrossingly" in her review forThe New York Times.[18]That same year, she guest-starred in four episodes of theNBCpolice dramaHill Street Blues.
Following the success ofThe Terminator, Hamilton starred as car thief Nina in the action thrillerBlack Moon Rising(1986). Also that year, she guest-starred in an episode ofMurder, She Wroteand headlined the big-budget adventure filmKing Kong Lives, a sequel to the1976 remake ofKing Kong. The film was a moderate financial success but was universally panned by critics.[19]
Hamilton's next major role was that of savvydistrict attorneyCatherine Chandler in the television seriesBeauty and the Beast. A modern re-telling of the classicfairy tale, the show ran for three seasons on CBS between 1987 and 1990, though Hamilton requested to be written out during its third season when she fell pregnant.[20]For her portrayal of Chandler, she won Austria'sRomy Awardfor Favorite Actress in a Series in 1990,[21]as well as receivingGolden GlobeandEmmy Awardnominations in 1988 and 1989, respectively.[22]
Hamilton returned to film with a starring role opposite in the 1990 fantasy-comedyMr. Destiny. In her review for theLos Angeles Times,Sheila Bensonbelieved that the film only worked because of "Hamilton's intrinsic warmth".[23]The following year, she re-teamed with James Cameron to star inTerminator 2: Judgment Day. Reported at the time to be the most expensive motion picture ever made,[24]it went on to gross over US$500 million worldwide; more than any other film that year.[25][26]Of his decision to present a more troubled version of the Sarah Connor character, Cameron later reflected, "It was all inspired by Linda really. I called her and said, 'Hey, we're [doing] anotherTerminator'. And she [replied], 'I want to be crazy'. I said, 'I can do that — I'll put you in a mental hospital'. She said, 'Perfect. That's what I want'".[27]Hamilton underwent intense physical training to emphasize the character's transformation during the seven years since the first film.[28]"I hated [my trainer] most of the time", she later said; "He would yell at me and throw tennis balls while I was shooting weapons blindfolded. I'd go off to the bathroom to cry for a minute, then I'd wipe away my tears and go back".[4]Critics were impressed by Hamilton's "wild-eyed" performance,[29][30]withDerek MalcolmofThe Guardiansingling out her "formidable sweaty intensity".[31]She went on to receive twoMTV Movie Awardsand the 1991Saturn Award for Best Actressfor her portrayal of Connor, which has since been recognised as one of the most iconic female roles in cinematic history.[32]Following the success ofT2, she was invited to host an episode ofSaturday Night Liveon November 16, 1991.[33]
Hamilton's subsequent film appearances were in the psychological thrillersSilent Fall(1994) andSeparate Lives(1995). For her performance in the television movieA Mother's Prayer(1995), where she played a widow diagnosed withAIDS, Hamilton received aCableACE Awardand aGolden Globenomination forBest Actress. On her decision to take the part, she said, "So many people think I'm just this incredibly ferocious, fierce woman. Sarah Connor has sort of etched herself into my psyche and will never go away. So I chose [to play] this woman because she was a great balance of strength and frailty".[34]She put herself on a strict diet in preparation for the role, saying, "I had to know what it was like … I knew that I had to sort of sink in on myself. So I got very, very thin".[34]
After guest-starring in an episode ofFrasier, Hamilton played leading roles in two features that were released one week apart in 1997: political thrillerShadow Conspiracyand the big-budget action-adventure filmDante's Peak. The latter proved to be one of the biggest commercial hits of the year, grossing US$180 million.[35]Critics were mostly unimpressed by the film's derivative narrative,[36]but some praised the effects and performances, withRoger Ebertwriting in his review for theChicago Sun-Times, "InBrosnanand Hamilton [the filmmakers] have actors who play for realism and don't go over the top".[37]For her portrayal of small-town mayor Rachel Wando, Hamilton was named Best Actress at the following year'sBlockbuster Entertainment Awards. Speaking of her casting, she said, "Police officers, military officers and lesbians. That was pretty much what I [used to get offered] and nothing else. [When I auditioned for director]Roger Donaldson, he literally said to me: 'You've never played a part like this before' … And [I said], 'What do you mean?' [He replied] 'Normal.' He thought I couldn't play normal! Jesus! It was just the way people thought [about me]".[38]
Between 1998 and 1999, Hamilton appeared in a succession of voice roles in episodes ofThe New Batman Adventures,Hercules, andBatman Beyond. Her next project was theLifetimemovieSex & Mrs. X(2000), where she played a magazine writer who experiences a sexual reawakening when she is assigned to interview an upper-class Parisianmadam. TheLos Angeles Timescalled it an "[intriguing] character study that passes muster on the strength of good performances by [its leads]", adding that Hamilton was both "tough" and "tender" in the part.[39]Later that year, she received aSatellite Award for Best Actressfor her performance in the television filmThe Color of Courage, whichVarietycalled "excellent".[40]She also headlined a production ofLaura, an adaptation of the1944 film noirof the same name, at California'sTiffany Theaterin December 2000. Hamilton received praise for her portrayal of the title character, with Jay Reiner ofThe Hollywood Reportercommenting:
There's an inherent risk in reviving a film classic likeLaura… [original star]Gene Tierney… left such an indelible impression that any [actress] trying to fill [her] shoes [is] probably going to suffer by comparison. Linda Hamilton accepts this risk, and even turns it to her advantage, in [this] sparkling production … Where [Tierney] gave us Laura Hunt as a ravishing femme fatale shrouded in mystery, Hamilton gives us a genuine charmer — a woman intriguing enough to invite attention, elusive enough to ensure pursuit and smart enough to make it all seem worthwhile … after a few minutes in her company, you don't want to be anywhere else.[41]
The following year, Hamilton starred in the small-scale mystery thrillerSkeletons in the Closet(2001), subsequently winning aDVD Exclusive Awardfor Best Supporting Actress. She then portrayed the real-lifeEthel RosenberginWorse Than Murder: Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, admitting that her decision to "transform myself into a tenement Jew from theLower East Side" had been a daunting one: "I'm already prepared for the critics to be unkind to me, like, 'Why is she playing a Jewish character' or 'What's she trying to do, prove she's an actress?' But the fear is just part of the process".[4]The play opened in May 2002—at theVentura Theatrein California—to a rave review fromVariety, who felt that Hamilton played her part with "sumptuous veracity".[42]Next, she had supporting roles in two films: the post-Vietnamwar dramaMissing in America(2005) and thePenelope Spheeris-directed comedyThe Kid & I(2005).
Hamilton's portrayal of Maxine Faulk in the 2006 stage adaptation ofThe Night of the IguanabyTennessee Williamswas met with acclaim. Writing forVariety, Frank Rizzo said, "[She is] well cast as the recently widowed but hardly mourning proprietress … She takes over the stage with natural assurance and plays this overripe survivor with lusty humor and cunning".[43]The production ran between August 1–12 at theBerkshire TheatreinStockbridge, Massachusetts.[44]
Hamilton reprised the role of Sarah Connor for a second time with a voice cameo in 2009'sTerminator Salvation,[45]which grossed US$371 million at the worldwide box office.[46]In 2010, she joined the cast of NBC's espionage-style comedy seriesChuck, playing the recurring role ofCIAagentMary Elizabeth Bartowski.[47]That same year, she guest-starred in three episodes of theShowtimedark comedyWeeds—as the marijuana supplier for the series' protagonist—and appeared as a "cartoon American cop" in the poorly received Irish filmHoly Water.[48][49]
In 2011, Hamilton narrated theChillernetwork'sThe Future of Fear, a documentary on the history of horror films.[50]She then played a fictional U.S. president in the television miniseriesAir Force One Is Down(2013), and had recurring roles as a bounty hunter on theShowcaseseriesLost Girl(2013) and a mentally ill mother onSyfy'sDefiance(2014–2015).[51]Her next projects were the television pilotShoot Me Nicely(2016),[52]which was later released as a short film,[53]and the small-scale science fiction filmCurvature(2017). In his evaluation of the latter forThe Hollywood Reporter,Frank Scheckdescribed it as "awfully loopy", adding, "it's always a pleasure to see Hamilton, even if it's painfully obvious that she's been cast [here] because of the genre resonance she brings to the table".[54]
Hamilton returned once more to theTerminatorfranchise and the character of Sarah Connor when she headlined theTim Miller-directedTerminator: Dark Fate, set 25 years after the events ofT2. She admitted to being reluctant to sign on to the project, having spent the previous few years away from the spotlight: "I love my alone time like no one you've ever met … That was my hesitation: Do I want to trade this lovely, authentic life [that I've built] for that? I didn't want my neighbours looking at me differently. We're neighbors because of who we are, not what we do, and I don't want that to creep into my life again".[55]
Filming onDark Fatetook place in Hungary, Spain and the U.S. between May and November 2018.[56]Though a financial disappointment,[57]it received generally positive reviews upon its 2019 release, particularly for Hamilton's performance.[58]Writing forRolling Stone, David Fear felt that she provided the film's "sinew, heart, and soul", and said of her introduction:
A truck pulls up, we see boots hit the ground, and there she is: Sarah Connor 1.0, sunglasses on, stoic and iconic as fuck, gunning down a sprinting shape-shifter and employing a rocket launcher for a finishing move. It's the sort of movie entrance that the character (and the actor) deserves, the kind that prompts spontaneous, uncontrollable cheering in theaters … Her weathered survivor will charitably share the screen with newcomers and old co-stars alike, but from this moment on,Dark Fateis Hamilton's property. She calmly slips the superior sequel into the back pocket of her faded work pants and walks away with it. Everyone else is acting inhermovie.[59]
Later that year, Hamilton was named Best Actress at the Los Angeles Crime and Horror Film Festival for her portrayal of "King George"—a ruthless crime boss—inEasy Does It,[60]whichFilm Threatdescribed as "excellent … a throwback to grindhouse adventure films [and westerns]".[61]She began appearing as General McCallister on Syfy'sResident Alienin 2021, whichIndieWirecalled a  "genre-bending … spry half-hour comedy [series]".[62]Also that year, she guest-starred as a hippie life coach in six episodes of theTNTdark comedyClawsduring its final season.[63]
It was announced in June 2023 that Hamilton would join the ensemble of theNetflixmystery-horror seriesStranger Thingsfor its fifth and final season—due to air in 2025—as an unspecified character.[64]A self-proclaimed fan of the show, she said of her casting, "I don't know how to be a fangirl and an actress at the same time. I'm going to work on that".[64]
Hamilton's twin sister, Leslie, died on August 22, 2020, at the age of 63.[6]Leslie appeared as Linda's double in a few scenes ofTerminator 2: Judgment Day, including the scene in which theT-1000disguises itself as Sarah Connor. Hamilton has described herself politically as aDemocrat, but she voted forRepublicancandidateArnold Schwarzenegger—herTerminatorco-star—in the2003 California electionafter his campaign convinced her he was suitable for the job.[65]While filmingTerminator 2: Judgment Day, Hamilton suffered permanent hearing damage in one ear because she had forgotten to put in her earplugs for a scene which called for Schwarzenegger to fire a shotgun inside an elevator.[66]
Hamilton has been married and divorced twice.[67]Her first marriage was to actorBruce Abbott, from 1982 to 1989. He left Hamilton when she was pregnant with their son Dalton, who was born in 1989.[68]She later stated Abbott departed due to her mood swings and physical abuse towards him stemming frombipolar disorder, and she publicly apologized to him in 2004.[69]
In 1991,[68]Hamilton began a relationship and moved in[55]with film directorJames Cameronafter filmingTerminator 2: Judgment Day.[70]They had a daughter, born in 1993.[68]Hamilton said she experiencedpostpartum depressionafter the birth of her second child.[70]Hamilton and Cameron briefly separated when Cameron was filmingTitanic(1997) and he began a relationship with actressSuzy Amis, who played a small role in the film.[71][70]Hamilton and Cameron later got back together and married in 1997;[70]this ended in a $50 million divorce settlement for Hamilton in 1999.[70]
In a 2019 interview forThe New York Times, Hamilton said she had beencelibatefor "at least 15 years".[55]"One loses track, because it just doesn't matter — or at least it doesn't matter to me. I have a very romantic relationship with my world every day and the people who are in it," she said.[55]
Hamilton started tobinge eatwhen she entered high school.[70]After seeing a psychologist for the first time at the age of 22 in 1978–1979,[70]she thought acting would help her feel better, but she ended up having a breakdown in the beginning of her acting career and turned to drugs and alcohol use and self-medicated with cocaine in order to get her confidence up.[70]In an October 2005 appearance onLarry King Live, Hamilton discussed her depression andbipolar disorder, which led to violent mood swings and suicidal thoughts during her marriage to Abbott and, in her view, caused the failure of both her marriages.[67]She also discussed how she eventually received therapy and medication to manage the condition.[67]
