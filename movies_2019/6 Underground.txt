Four years after witnessing the horrors of a brutal regime in the fictional Central Asian nation ofTurgistan, American billionaire andphilanthropistMagnet S. Johnson, who made his fortune from inventingneodymium magnets, fakes his own death to form an anonymousvigilantesquad to take down criminals and terrorists which the world as a whole either cannot or will not pursue. Known as One, he recruits five others to abandon their pasts and join his cause, each given a numbered nickname similar to his own: Two, a spy; Three, a hitman; Four, aparkourrunner and thief; Five, a doctor; and Six, a driver. They refer to themselves collectively asghosts.
On their first mission inFlorence, Italy, the team interrogates the lawyer of Turgistan's four highest-ranking generals for information on those generals before driving across the city in a dayglow greenAlfa Romeo GiuliaQuadrifoglio[4]while chased by the Mafia and the Italian police. Six is killed just as they get away.
Days later, One recruits Blaine, a former sniper fromDelta Forcesuffering fromsurvivor guiltas he was ordered not to save his team inAfghanistan. He is convinced to fake his suicide and is renamed Seven. One plans to stage acoup d'étatto topple the government of Turgistan dictator Rovach Alimov and install Alimov's imprisoned brother, Murat—a staunch supporter of democracy—as the country's new leader. It is revealed that in the past, then–CIAspy Two had reluctantly captured Murat and handed him back to Rovach.
The ghosts assassinate Rovach's generals inLas Vegas, learn of Murat's location, and successfully extract Murat from his penthouse imprisonment inHong Kong. During the extraction, Four is caught by one of Rovach's men, who begins severely beating him. Seven is unwilling to subscribe to One's philosophy that "the mission always comes first," instead following his personal philosophy to never leave a teammate behind. Ignoring One's protests, Seven manages to save Four. Afterward, Seven convinces all but One to reveal their real names.
In Turgistan, One sets his plan in motion byhackingthe state-run television station during Rovach's public address to the nation and giving Murat the platform he needs to spread his message of democracy. Murat's impromptu speech inspires a citizen revolt, and strategic explosions in the city force Rovach to evacuate to his private yacht. The ghosts storm the yacht and One activates a magnetic pulse invention to incapacitate the guards. When the yacht is immobilized in the middle of the ocean and Four is once again in mortal danger, One chooses to save Four instead of capturing Rovach. Rovach flees by helicopter only to discover it to be commandeered by Murat and the ghosts, who drop him helpless in a refugee camp where he is beaten to death by an angry mob.
In the aftermath of the revolution, Murat becomes Turgistan's new president and the ghosts part ways until their next mission is determined. Two and Three begin a relationship. Four and Five go climbing together. One and Seven travel toNew York City. Seven tosses his gun into a nearby river but keeps the last remaining bullet, and One watches from a distance as the woman he loved before his faked death plays with her young son, who is implied to be One's son as well.

"There's a lot of priceless stuff in this movie," he said, "like where we have cars flying between an obelisk. Why they allowed me to have flying cars by an obelisk that's 800 years old, I don't know. But we didn't hurt anything."[23]After Bay watched their videos on YouTube, the BritishparkourteamStorrorjoined the film's production to choreograph and perform the parkour sequences in the film.[24]They perform the stunts between skyscrapers and cranes, including some scenes on theFlorence Cathedral.[25]Principal photography wrapped on December 5, 2018.[26]The film's production reportedly cost $150 million, making it one of the most expensive films made by Netflix at the time.[27]

Jesse Hassenger ofThe A.V. Clubgave the film a "C" and stated, "What [director Michael Bay] seems to be chasing is the feeling of freedom, the windswept open-skies exhilaration of a man who has everything. But he's still just doing donuts, hoping all those whiplash turns from nihilism to macho sentiment awaken something inside him."[43]Peter BradshawofEmpiregave the film 2 out of 5 and said, "If you like your Bayhem pure and unfiltered, this one's for you. Others need not apply." David Fear ofRolling Stonegave the film 1.5 out of 5 and listed what he called the film's ingredients: "Guns. Ferraris... Parkour. Headshots. Mélanie Laurent. Las Vegas.

Not all reviews were negative.Glenn Kennyof theNew York Timesgave the film a positive review: "There are genuinely eccentric innovations here. There's certainly not a whole lot of recognizable humanity, but hey, that's why there's 'It's a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood'."[50]Barry Hertz ofThe Globe and Mailgave the film 3.5 out of 4 and stated the movie is "a riotous and gleefully delirious assault on the senses. It is vulgar. It is absurd. And it is completely enthralling."[51]Nick Schager ofThe Daily Beastgave the film a positive review, stating, "For better and worse, in a multiplex or on your television or tablet, it delivers pleasure through pain."[52]Adam Graham ofThe Detroit Newsgave the film aBand said, "The madman director's Netflix debut6 Undergroundis so big it feels like it's going to smash out of your television screen."[53]

He considered the film to be a failure: "We didn't feel like we got there on [6 Underground] creatively. It was a nice hit, but at the end of the day we didn't feel like we nailed the mark to justify coming back again. There just wasn't that deep love for those characters or that world."[58][59]
