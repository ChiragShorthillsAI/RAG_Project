The Red Sea Diving Resort(also known asOperation Brothers)[1]is a 2019spythriller filmwritten and directed byGideon Raff. The film starsChris Evansas an IsraeliMossadagent who runs a covert operation to rescueEthiopian-Jewishrefugees fromSudanto safe haven inIsrael.Michael K. Williams,Haley Bennett,Alessandro Nivola,Michiel Huisman,Chris Chalk,Greg Kinnear, andBen Kingsleyare in supporting roles.
The film is loosely based on the events of Israel'sOperation MosesandOperation Joshuain 1984-1985, in which the Mossad covertly rescuedJewish-Ethiopianrefugees who suffered from persecutions in Sudan in Africa, by smuggling them all the way to the safety ofIsrael, using a base at the once-abandoned holiday resort of Arous Village on the SudaneseRed Seacoast, about 70km (43 miles) north ofPort Sudan.[2]
The Red Sea Diving Resortpremiered at theSan Francisco Jewish Film Festivalon July 28, 2019, and was released on July 31, 2019, byNetflix. Critical reaction to the film was predominantly negative, while audiences were mixed to positive.[3]
Kebede Bimro, anEthiopian Jewloosely based onFerede Aklum, works with theIsraeliMossadagent Ari Levinson to evacuate Jewish-Ethiopian refugees to Israel. Ari realizes that his ability to operate in Ethiopia would be improved if he had a cover activity that would give him a reason for having a building and vehicles. He proposes to Israeli intelligence officer Ethan Levin a plan that would allow him to evacuate significantly more refugees: rent the Red Sea Diving Resort, an abandoned Sudanese coastal hotel, and run it as afrontto facilitate moving refugees out of the country. The unorthodox plan is reluctantly approved, and Ari recruits his former Mossad colleagues Rachel Reiter, Jake Wolf, Max Rose, and Sammy Navon, to assist him.
Shortly after the team's arrival in Sudan, the brochures they had printed inspire actual tourists to begin arriving at the resort. Although hosting guests was not originally part of the plan, Levinson realizes the tourists will provide cover for the team's operations, so the team runs the resort as a legitimate business while simultaneously evacuating refugees to a waiting Israeli ship off the coast. The plan is initially successful, and multiple extraction operations are carried out, but theSudaneseColonel Abdel Ahmed learns of Bimro after interrogating and then killing a group of refugees. Ahmed visits the resort to investigate but does not discover the refugee operation.
One night, Ari and Sammy are arrested after an evacuation mission narrowly escapes from Sudanese soldiers. They are released and return to the resort to find Levin awaiting them; he tells the group the mission has been compromised and that it is canceled.
Ahmed again visits the resort, and Rachel is forced to kill one of his men after the soldier discovers a group of refugees hiding there. To evacuate them, Ari decides to perform a final refugee extraction by cargo plane with assistance from Walton Bowen, aCIAofficer. Ari and his team transport the refugees to an abandoned British airfield. The team and Bimro narrowly escape Ahmed and extract themselves and the refugees.
The Red Sea Diving Resortis loosely based on the events ofOperation MosesandOperation Joshua(jointly referred to asOperation Brothers), in which Ethiopian Jews were covertly moved from refugee camps in Sudan to Israel during the 1980s. The actual abandoned resort, the Arous Holiday Village on theRed Sea, was located roughly 70 kilometers fromPort Sudanand was managed byMossadoperatives until 1985. The existence of these operations was first revealed inGad Shimron’s 1998 bookMossad Exodus: The Daring Undercover Rescue of the Lost Jewish Tribe,[4]though the film is not associated with the book.[5]
In August 2015,Fox Searchlightpurchased the rights for the film.[6]Development on the film was first announced in March 2017, withGideon Raffdirecting and writing the screenplay, andChris EvansandHaley Bennettcast.[7][8]In April,Michael K.

OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 29% based on 42 reviews, with a weighted average of 4.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The Red Sea Diving Resortmakes uninspired use of actual events, using thinly written characters to tell a story derailed by its own good intentions."[16]OnMetacritic, the film has a score of 29 out of 100, based on reviews from eight critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[17]

Haley Loraine Keeling(born January 7, 1988), known professionally asHaley Bennett, is an American actress. She made her film debut in the romantic comedyMusic and Lyrics(2007) and has since appeared in films such asThe Equalizer(2014),The Magnificent Seven(2016),Hillbilly Elegy(2020), andCyrano(2021).
Bennett was born Haley Loraine Keeling inFort Myers, Florida, on January 7, 1988.[1]Her parents, Leilani (néeDorsey Bennett) and Ronald Keeling,[2][3]met in church and hitchhiked to Florida while Leilani was pregnant with her.[4]Bennett has Lithuanian ancestry through a maternal great-grandmother.[5][6][7]She was raised inNaples, Florida.[2]Her parents divorced when she was six years old and she moved toOhiowith her father, who opened an automobile repair shop there.[4]They moved regularly around the state, with Bennett later saying, "There was no time when I lived anywhere longer than two years.

Maybe I didn't care what people thought because I [thought], 'Well, I probably won't stick around here for too long.'"[4]Bennett describes her childhood as "nomadic", as she moved between living with her father in Ohio and her mother in Florida:
I lived somewhat of a nomadic life even when I lived in Ohio. We spent time in rural areas, in suburban areas, never really city areas. We rode four-wheelers. We had pigs and ferrets. And creeks. We had a creek in my backyard. It was likeHuckleberry Finn... I was kind of a tomboy for awhile. It's tough to explain because I grew up with my mom and my dad simultaneously but separately because they weren't together. So I kind of get femininity from my mother and boyishness from my dad. He loved fishing, he loves hunting, he loves boating, and football, baseball, and basketball. So that really saturated my life. And then my mother was very soft and also strong, but more of an artist. So I kind of had the best of both worlds.[8]

The film was a critical and financial success with film criticRoger EbertofThe Chicago Sun-Timespraising the casting of Kingsley in the lead role writing, "makes the role so completely his own that there is a genuine feeling that the spirit of Gandhi is on the screen. Kingsley's performance is powerful without being loud or histrionic; he is almost always quiet, observant, and soft-spoken on the screen, and yet his performance comes across with such might that we realize, afterward, that the sheer moral force of Gandhi must have been behind the words."[28]Kingsley went on to win numerous accolades for his performance including theAcademy Award for Best Actor, theBAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Dramafor his performance.[22]The following year he acted in the British drama filmBetrayal(1983), an adaptation of the1978 play of the same titlebyHarold Pinter.

The film was a critical and commercial success, and Kingsley received a nomination forBAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Todd McCarthy ofVarietywrote of his performance, "Kingsley must act within much more rigid constraints as his trusted accountant Stern, a man who feels he must never make a misstep. Role is reminiscent ofAlec Guinness' deluded Col. Nicholson inThe Bridge on the River Kwai; in his compulsion to do a perfect job for Schindler, he often seems to forget that he's working for the enemy."[33]Further roles include theBBCadaptation ofSilas Marner(1985) as the titular character.

Kingsley took on the role of Don Logan, a violent psychopath and recruiter for London's underworld, inJonathan Glazer'sSexy Beast(2000), apsychologicalblack comedycrime filmacting withRay WinstoneandIan McShane.[37]CriticPeter BradshawofThe Guardianpraised his performance writing, "The role of Don Logan is perfectly suited to Ben Kingsley's gifts for control and stillness. There is something a little baroque and stylised about his approach – it is arguably a little actorly and unlike the behaviour of any real villain. But it is a very funny, intelligent performance nonetheless, beautifully scripted and acted, and Kingsley tops it off with a bravura show of pure sociopathic cunning".[38]Kingsley's role as Logan earned him another Academy Award nomination forBest Supporting Actor.
