The day's guests include British-Iranian heiress Zahra Kashani[9]and her American husband David, with their infant son Cameron and his nanny Sally, as well as ex-Spetznazoperative Vasili.
That night, terrorists from theLashkar-e-Taibaorganization, under the command of "the Bull",launch a coordinated assault against 12 locations across Mumbai, including the hotel. As the local police are not properly trained or equipped to handle the attack, they are forced to wait for reinforcements fromNew Delhi. In the ensuing chaos, Arjun, David, Zahra and Vasili are trapped in the hotel restaurant with several other guests while Sally remains with Cameron in their hotel room. A woman fleeing from the terrorists enters the hotel room, and Sally hides with Cameron in a closet as the terrorists shoot the woman and then leave.
Hearing of Sally's close encounter, David manages to sneak past the terrorists and successfully reach Sally and Cameron. Meanwhile, Arjun escorts the other guests to the Chambers Lounge, an exclusive club hidden within the hotel, where they hope to remain safe. David, Sally and Cameron attempt to regroup with the others, but David is captured and bound by the terrorists while Sally and Cameron are trapped inside a closet.
Meanwhile, police officer DC Vam and his partner enter the hotel in the hopes of reaching the security room so they can track the terrorists' movements. Inside, Arjun attempts to escort a mortally wounded guest to a hospital, but upon encountering the officers, she panics and flees before being killed by a terrorist. Arjun escorts the officers to the security room where they discover the terrorists about to break into the Chambers Lounge. Vam orders Arjun to stay as he goes to attack the terrorists, successfully wounding one named Imran.
Against Oberoi's advice, Zahra and Vasili, along with several other guests, decide to leave the lounge to escape, but Zahra and Vasili are caught and taken hostage along with David, while the others are killed in their attempt to escape.
While guarding the hostages, Imran contacts his family members, and reveals that the terrorists left to attack Mumbai under the guise of military training. He also discovers that while the Bull had promised to pay the families of the terrorists, they have yet to receive any money from him.
Eventually, theNSGarrive, and the Bull orders the terrorists to burn the hotel down. The terrorists leave Imran to guard the hostages, and the Bull orders Imran to kill them.

Rex ReedofThe New York Observerwrote: "There isn't a single wasted frame in this movie, which is both richly detailed and economically direct in its emotional impact-all the more astounding for a first feature film. Without exception, everyone is exemplary... You leave sated, with the rare feeling of having learned something about history and knowing you've been to one hell of a movie."[34]Katie Goh ofThe Guardianwrote: "Patel is subdued yet excellent in Anthony Maras's white knuckle retelling of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. ... For all its subplots, Maras keeps a tight leash on the film's narrative strands as we watch characters move in and out of each other's stories. Hotel Mumbai is an excellent, white-knuckle thriller – and an unlikely crowdpleaser."[35]Malina Saval ofVarietywrote: "The cinematic result is a film that is as visually breathtaking as it is emotionally electrifying, an edge-of-your-seat study on the effects of tragedy and violence on a group of strangers banding together in a fight to survive the unthinkable."[36]
Jordan Mintzer ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "Maras does an excellent job on such an ambitious first feature, covering every corner of the hotel and making each gunshot or explosion feel like the real thing. The level of verisimilitude is so high that when Maras cuts in actual documentary footage, it's hard to tell it apart from the fiction. As close to reality as a movie can be."[37]Anne Cohen ofRefinery29wrote: "Anthony Maras' harrowing feature debut depicting the 2008 Mumbai attacks transcends those tired tropes to deliver one of most breathlessly stressful, emotional and insightful depictions of terrorism and its victims I've ever seen."[38]
Jeff Sneider ofColliderwrote: "Australian filmmaker Anthony Maras announces himself as a major director to watch with his feature debut Hotel Mumbai. It's a true ensemble piece, with a standout performance from Bollywood legend Anupam Kher, who registers strongest as the hotel's Chef and de facto leader of the hostages."[39]David Ehrlich ofIndieWirewrote: "Dev Patel and Armie Hammer star in a lucid, humane, and almost unwatchably harrowing drama about the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks."[40]

As a Jewish teen in London, Isaacs enduredantisemitismby theNational Front, afar-right extremistorganisation. His parents eventuallyemigrated to Israel.[9]He later told an interviewer, "There were constantly people beating us up or smashing windows. If you were ever, say, on a Jewish holiday, identifiably Jewish, there was lots of violence around. But particularly when I was 16, in 1979, the National Front were really taking hold, there were leaflets at school, andSieg Heilingand peoplegoose-steppingdown the road and coming after us."[7]Following in the footsteps of his three brothers (one who became a doctor, one a lawyer, and one an accountant),[6]he studied law atBristol Universityfrom 1982 to 1985, becoming involved in the university's theatre club there; he eventually acted in over 30 plays and performed each summer at theEdinburgh Festival Fringe, first with Bristol University and then twice with the National Student Theatre Company.

Rowling, he has said: "I went off and read the books after the audition and I read the first four books in one sitting—you know—didn't wash, didn't eat, drove around with them on the steering wheel like a lunatic. I suddenly understood why my friends, who I'd thought were slightly backward, had been so addicted to these children's books. They're likecrack." (From an interview in 2009 on ITV'sThe Justin Lee Collins Show)[16]
In "The Naked and the Dead", an article published in theSan Francisco Chronicle, on 26 November 2006, Neva Chonin named the character Lucius Malfoy one of the 12 "Sexiest Men Who Were Never Alive" and Isaacs one of the 13 "Sexiest Men Who Are Real and Alive".[17]

I can't bear the idea that somebody else would get to wear myParis Hiltonwig, but you never know."[18]Isaacs also talked to Rowling on the inclusion of Lucius Malfoy in the then unpublishedHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, so that he would have a part in the seventh and final film: "The character does not appear in the sixth book,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince; but ... [Isaacs joked], 'I fell to my knees and begged ... It didn't do any good. I'm sure she doesn't need plot ideas from me. But I made my point. We'll see. Like everybody else, I'm holding my breath to July to see what's in there. I just want to bust out of prison, that's all. I don't want to stay inAzkabanmost of my life.' "[19]Ultimately Isaacs did reprise the role of Malfoy as acameo appearanceinHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince(2009), where he is seen in a movingportrait.
