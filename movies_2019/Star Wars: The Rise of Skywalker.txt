Lucasfilm Ltd. LLCis an American film and televisionproduction companyfounded by filmmakerGeorge Lucasin 1971 inSan Rafael, California, and later moved toSan Franciscoin 2005.[3]It is best known for creating and producing theStar WarsandIndiana Jonesfranchises, as well as its leadership in developing special effects, sound, andcomputer animationfor films. Since 2012, Lucasfilm has been a subsidiary ofThe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which are both ultimately owned bythe Walt Disney Company, who also owns former Lucasfilm subsidiaryPixar(formerly known as the Graphics Group before being spun off as a corporation in 1986, acquired by Disney in 2006).
The company's filmsStar Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace(1999),Star Wars: The Force Awakens(2015),Rogue One: A Star Wars Story(2016),Star Wars: The Last Jedi(2017), andStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker(2019) are all among the50 highest-grossing filmsof all time, withThe Force Awakensbecoming thehighest-grossing film in the United States and Canada. On October 30, 2012, Disney acquired Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion in the form of cash and in stock.[4][5][6][7]Lucasfilm is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideWalt Disney Pictures,Marvel Studios,20th Century StudiosandSearchlight Pictures.
Lucasfilm was founded by filmmakerGeorge Lucasin 1971 inSan Rafael, California,[8]and was incorporated as Lucasfilm Ltd. on September 12, 1977.[9]In the mid-1970s, the company's offices were located on theUniversal Studios Lot.[10]Lucas founded theStar Wars Corporation, Inc.as a subsidiary to control various legal and financial aspects ofStar Wars(1977),[11]including copyright, and sequel and merchandising rights. It also produced the 1978Star Wars Holiday Specialfor20th Century Fox Television.[12]That year, Lucas hired Los Angeles-based real-estate specialist Charles Weber to manage the company, telling him that he could keep the job as long as he made money.[13]Lucas wanted the focus of the company to be making independent films, but the company gradually became enlarged from five employees to almost 100, increasing in middle management and running up costs. In 1980, after Weber asked Lucas for fifty million dollars to invest in other companies and suggested that they sellSkywalker Ranchto do so, Lucas fired Weber and had to let half of the Los Angeles staff go.[13]By the same year, the corporate subsidiary had been discontinued and its business was absorbed into the various divisions of Lucasfilm. And of course, it was also the same year when the second Star Wars film,The Empire Strikes Back,was released in cinemas as an official sequel to the original 1977 film.
Between 1981 and 1989, threeIndiana Jonesfilms, stories by Lucas and directed bySteven Spielberg, were released. WhileReturn of the Jedi(1983) was in production, Lucas decided not to pursue furtherStar Warsfilms.[14]Despite the third film achieving similarclassicstatus to its two predecessors, George was unhappy with the cinema presentation ofReturn of the Jedi, he created the companyTHX, which was unveiled on May 20, 1983.[15]Lucasfilm produced theJohn Korty-directed animated filmTwice Upon a Time(1983). 1985 saw the release ofPaul Schrader'sMishima: A Life in Four Chapters. The next year,Jim Henson'sLabyrinthand an adaptation ofMarvel Comics'Howard the Duckwere released.Ron Howarddirected the fantasy filmWillowin 1988 (story by Lucas); the same year the children's animated filmThe Land Before Timewas released. From 1992 to 1993,The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles(created by Lucas) television series was produced. In 1992, after viewing an earlycomputer-generated imagerytest created byIndustrial Light & Magic(ILM) forJurassic Park, Lucas announced his intentions to produce aStar WarsPrequel Trilogy.[16]In 1994, the long-delayedRadioland Murders(story by Lucas) was released. In 1995, Lucas began production on the prequel trilogy. The trilogy took 10 years to make, ending with the release of the third prequel filmStar Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sithin 2005 where all three prequels had received mixed to negative reviews. In addition to the prequels, Lucas released theSpecial Editionsfor theStar WarsOriginal Trilogy in 1997, 2004 and 2011, forVHS,DVDandBlu-ray, which were met with increasingly negative reception.
In 1987, the company, which at that time, was expanding from three to five films a year on its own, decided to increase making its Northern California production facilities available to other filmmakers.[17]In 1989, Lucasfilm launched a new subsidiary Lucasfilm Entertainment Group (later LucasArts Entertainment Company) to consolidate all four units, which areIndustrial Light & Magic, Lucasfilm Commercial Productions,Lucasfilm Games, andSprocket Systems.[18]
In 2005, Lucasfilm opened a new studio in Singapore.[19]That same year,Lucasfilm Animationcommenced production of a 3D animatedStar Warstelevision series calledStar Wars: The Clone Wars, with key production team members including executive producerCatherine Winder, supervising directorDave Filoni, Head of Lucasfilm Animation Singapore Chris Kubsch, andHenry Gilroy.[20]Primary production took place at Lucasfilm Animation's Singapore studio.[21]Airing onCartoon Networkbetween 2008 and 2013,[22]The Clone Warswas well received by fans and was nominated for several film awards including theDaytime Emmy Awardsand theAnnie Awards.[23][24]
In January 2012, Lucas announced his retirement from producing large-scaleblockbusterfilms and instead re-focusing his career on smaller, independently budgeted features.[25][26]In June 2012, it was announced thatKathleen Kennedy, a long-term collaborator with Steven Spielberg and a producer of theIndiana Jonesfilms, had been appointed as co-chair of Lucasfilm Ltd. It was reported that Kennedy would work alongside Lucas, who would remain chief executive and serve as co-chairman for at least one year, after which she would succeed him as the company's chairperson, which she did in June 2013.[27]
On July 8, 2012, Lucasfilm's marketing, online, and licensing units moved into the newLetterman Digital Arts Centerlocated in thePresidioin San Francisco. It shares the complex with Industrial Light & Magic. Lucasfilm had planned an expansion at Skywalker Ranch inMarin County, California, but shelved the plan in 2012 due to opposition from neighbors. However, it still plans to expand elsewhere.[28]Skywalker Soundremains the only Lucasfilm division based at Skywalker Ranch.[29]
On September 5, 2012, Micheline Chau, who served as president and COO of Lucasfilm for two decades, announced that she was retiring. With her departure, senior executives for each of the Lucasfilm divisions would report directly to Kathleen Kennedy. Chau was credited with keeping the Lucasfilm andStar Warsbrands strong, especially through animation spin-offs and licensing initiatives.[30]
Discussions relating to the possibility ofthe Walt Disney Companysigning a distribution deal with Lucasfilm officially began in May 2011, after a meeting that George Lucas had with Disney CEOBob Igerduring the inauguration of theStar Tours – The Adventures Continueattraction.[31]Lucas told Iger he was considering retirement and planned to sell Lucasfilm, as well as theStar WarsandIndiana Jonesfranchises.[32]On October 30, 2012, Disney announced a deal to acquire Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion,[33]with approximately half in cash and half in shares of Disney stock.[4]Lucasfilm had previously collaborated with Disney'sWalt Disney Imagineeringdivision to create theme park attractions centered onStar WarsandIndiana Jonesfor variousWalt Disney Parks and Resortsworldwide.[34]
Kathleen Kennedy, co-chairwoman of Lucasfilm, became president of Lucasfilm, reporting to the Walt Disney Studios ChairmanAlan Horn. Additionally, she serves as the brand manager forStar Wars, working directly with Disney's global lines of business to build, further integrate, and maximize the value of this global franchise. Kennedy serves as producer on newStar Warsfeature films, with George Lucas originally announced as serving as a creative consultant.[35]The company also announced the future release of newStar Warsfilms, starting withEpisode VII: The Force Awakensin 2015.[34]
Under the deal, Disney acquired ownership ofStar Wars,Indiana Jones, and Lucasfilm's operating businesses in live-action film production, consumer products, video games, animation, visual effects, and audio post-production.[36]Disney also acquired Lucasfilm's portfolio of entertainment technologies. The intent was for Lucasfilm employees to remain in their current locations.[37]Star Warsmerchandising would begin under Disney in the fiscal year 2014.[38]Starting withStar Wars Rebels, certain products will be co-branded with the Disney name,[39][40]akin to what Disney has done withPixar.[41]On December 4, 2012, the Disney-Lucasfilm merger was approved by theFederal Trade Commission(FTC), allowing the acquisition to be finalized without dealing withantitrustproblems.[42]On December 18, 2012, Lucasfilm Ltd. converted from acorporationto alimited liability company(LLC), changing its name to Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC in the process.[43]On December 21, 2012, Disney completed the acquisition and Lucasfilm became a wholly owned subsidiary of Disney.[6][7]
At the time of Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm,20th Century Fox, the original distributor of the first sixStar Warsfilms, were to retain the physical and theatrical distribution rights to both the prequel trilogy and EpisodesVandVIof the original trilogy until May 2020, along with full distribution rights for theoriginal 1977 filmin perpetuity.[44]Lucasfilm retained the television and digital distribution rights toStar WarsEpisodesIthroughVIwith exception to EpisodeIV.[45]On March 20, 2019, Disney officiallyacquired20th Century Fox after acquiring its owner,21st Century Fox, thus consolidating all the distribution and ownership rights to all the films under its umbrella.[7]In December 2013, Walt Disney Studios purchased the distribution and marketing rights to futureIndiana Jonesfilms fromParamount Pictures, although the latter studio would retain the distribution rights to the first four films and would receive "financial participation" from any additional films.[46][47]This would make the fifth installment,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, become the first film in the franchise and Lucasfilm's first film overall to be co-produced byWalt Disney Pictures.[48]
In early 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger disclosed Lucasfilm's plans to releasestandaloneStar Warsfilmsalongside theSequel Trilogyover a six-year period.[49]This strategy aimed to expand theStar Warsuniverse beyond the main saga. The first of these standalone films,Rogue One, premiered in 2016, followed bySolo: A Star Wars Storyin 2018.[50][51]
On May 6, 2013,LucasArts, thevideo gamedevelopment division of Lucasfilm, underwent closure, resulting in layoffs for most of its staff.[52]Despite this, LucasArts maintained a small team to handle video game licensing. Disney subsequently entered an exclusive agreement withElectronic Arts(EA) to produceStar Warsgames for the core gaming market for a decade. LucasArts retained licensing rights, while Disney Interactive Studios focused on casual gaming.[53][54]Due to the lower-than-expected sales, EA's exclusive deal was halted in January 2021, more than three years before their contract was set to expire on October 14, 2024.[55][56]
In January 2014, it was announced thatDark Horse Comicswould be losing its license forStar WarscomicstoMarvel Comics, another Disney subsidiary, in 2015.[57]That April, Lucasfilm announced that theStar WarsExpanded Universecontent would be rebranded asStar Wars Legends, with only selected works, including the six episodic films andThe Clone Wars, deemed canon. Additionally, a new line of canonStar Warsbooks began publication under the Lucasfilm story group.[58]
Lucasfilm continued its expansion globally, opening its regional headquarters in Singapore in 2014.[19]This facility housed staff from Lucasfilm, The Walt Disney Company Southeast Asia and ESPN Asia Pacific.[19]Meanwhile, between 2015 and 2018, Lucasfilm released several cinematic films, including critical and commercial successes likeEpisode VII: The Force AwakensandRogue One, alongside the less successfulSolo.[59][50][51]
After the mixed performance ofSoloat the box office, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed a slowdown in release of newStar Warsfilms.[60]Lucasfilm moved its focus on developing content forDisney+by launching several programs including the successful seriesThe Mandalorianseries on Disney+.[61]
In November 2023, Dave Filoni revealed that he was promoted to be the chief creative officer at the studio and would be directly involved in the planning of futureStar Warsfilmsand Star Wars in otherseries.[62]

Any movie ... has a fundamental conversation happening during it. And [forInto Darkness,] I didn't have it... [The weakness of the plot] was not anyone's fault but mine. ... [The script] was a little bit of a collection of scenes that were written by my friends ... And yet, I found myself frustrated by my choices, and unable to hang my hat on an undeniable thread of the main story. So then I found myself on that movie basically tap-dancing as well as I could to try and make the sequences as entertaining as possible. ... I would never say that I don't think that the movie ended up working. But I feel like it didn't work as well as it could have, had I made some better decisions before we started shooting."[20]

Terrio recalls the experience of writing a dialogue-intensive scene forArgo:
Scene 58--nine men sitting in a conference room talking through scenarios for cover stories to get Americans out of Iran--was difficult. There's nothing to cut to except the actors' faces. The tension has to come from the subtle shifts of power. CIA and State Department officials debate ideas, each worse than the last. I knew the crucial beat would come when our hero, Tony Mendez, speaks up. He couldn't seem disrespectful, yet he had to make his case. I settled on the idea that Mendez would throw a spitball into the conversation with a joke about giving the bicycle escapees Gatorade. The table would go silent. The attention of the room would shift to the court jester. I also had to determine whether Gatorade was on the market and a commonly recognized brand in December 1979. I celebrated when I found a magazine from the year before featuring a dehydrated athlete with aVillage Peoplemoustache: 'Gatorade: When You're Thirsty to Win.'[12]

He would tell me these horrible stories. He was a captain, a reconnaissance soldier. I became James' therapist. So it would have been unethical to sleep with my patient."[37]

He has received anOlivier Award for Best ActorforInsignificance(1982) and aTony Award for Best Featured Actor in a PlayforFaith Healer(2006).
He gained prominence for portrayingPalpatinein theStar Warsfranchise starting fromReturn of the Jedi(1983).[1]He also acted inGorky Park(1983),Dirty Rotten Scoundrels(1988),Restoration(1995),Sleepy Hollow(1999), andThe Lost City of Z(2016).
McDiarmid was born inCarnoustie,Angus, Scotland, on 11 August 1944.[2]He became a theatre aficionado when he was five years old, when his father took him to see an act named Tommy Morgan at a theatre inDundee. In 2004, he stated, "It sort of fascinated me, and it also scared me. All those lights, all that make-up. I said to myself, 'I don't know what this is, but I want it.'"[3]
However, fearing his father's disapproval, McDiarmid attended Queen's College, Dundee (now theUniversity of Dundee, but then a constituent part of theUniversity of St Andrews), where he received aMaster of Artsinpsychology.

J. Abramsnoted, "Lando was always written as a complex, contradictory, nuanced character. And Billy Dee played him to suave perfection, ... It wasn't just that people of color were seeing themselves represented; they were seeing themselves represented in a rich, wonderful, intriguing way."[34]Over the years, Williams has been a featured guest atfan conventions, mostlyscience fictionones for his role. Of his fan interactions he has said they have mostly been positive ones, "I love every single moment of it, I'll have an audience for the rest of my life."[35][36]

He was commissioned for four paintings—including one oftrack and fieldstarJesse Owenssprinting, and another of a pair of boxers in a fight ring—forNissanthat were displayed at the1996 Summer OlympicsinAtlanta, Georgia.[46][35]In 1997, he did paintings forWalt Disney Company's Mighty Ducks arena for theAnaheim Ducks.[35]From a description, circa late 1990s, at one of the galleries that carries his work, "Billy's paintings are usuallyacrylicon canvas, applied with brush andairbrush.

"Sometimes I refer to them as 'impressions/expression.' It's the best way I can explain them."[1]In early 2001 Williams was one of the celebrity artists painting seven-foot angel sculptures as part of the Oscar Academy's sponsoring L.A.'s "A Community of Angels" charity project.[48][49]The art angels were displayed for months then auctioned to raise funds for L.A. youth programs.[48][49]In his online gallery biography, he states, "[an] interest inEastern philosophycharacterizes his images, first to record the physical reality, and then to uncover through the application of light, color and perspective. He citesEdward Hopper,M. C. Escher—the Dutch Master,Frida Kahlo,Tamara de Lempicka,Thomas Hart Benton, and the exciting, vibrant forms ofAfrican artas some of his strongest influences."[8][44]Williams' work is included at theSchomburg Center for Research in Black Culturein New York, and theAmerican Jazz Museumin Kansas City, Missouri.[6]
In a 2001 interview he said, "Either I want to drop dead with a paint brush in my hand or I want to drop dead doing a soliloquy on the stage, I love acting. I love it. I take my acting very seriously, but I also find it fun. To do what children do and get paid for it is a lot of fun. I'm very fortunate."[14]In late 2007, he was a guest artist on a ten-dayPrincess Cruise liner.[50]They bought about eighty pieces which they put on their cruises and then auctioned off.[50]He was commissioned for another set of Disney paintings to be unveiled in 2011 at Disney'sD23 Expo, also inAnaheim, California.[36]For those, he set iconic Disney charactersMickeyandMinnie Mouse, andGoofyin jazz music settings.[36]In a 2011 interview he said, "I mostly create abstract paintings. I paint what's obvious to the eye and then incorporate an abstract point of view, which allows me a lot of space to play in. I work a lot with acrylic and oils, mostly acrylic right now and do a lot of line drawings."[51]In a September 2015 interview, he said he finds painting "cathartic" compared to collective film work, "When you're painting you just lock yourself up in your little private world. And it's all about you and your imagination and nobody else interfering with that. It's a great exercise because you really start discovering who you are and what you are without a lot of assistance … and the moment you come up with something interesting it's a success that’s really based on your own personal, private sensibility."[7]As of 2019 he has made around 300 paintings, which Williams sees as his legacy.[34]
In 1961, Williams recorded ajazzLP produced byPrestige RecordsentitledLet's Misbehave, on which he coveredswingstandards.[6]The album was named after itssecond track. it included the first-ever vocal recording of "A Taste of Honey", a song byBobby ScottandRic Marlowlater covered byThe Beatleson their 1963 debut albumPlease Please Me.[6]Williams was later the first to sing the song in the U.S., on theBroadwaystage withJoan Plowrightas part of the original Broadway production of the playA Taste of Honey.[6]The commercial success of his album lalter earned Williams a spot onMotown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever(1983). Williams said of the album, "Recording it was sort of a lark. I did some singing in clubs, for a moment, and then I stopped. I have too much respect for singers to really think that I'm a singer."[6]The album was re-released on CD, download and streaming platforms in 2014.
Thirty years later, in the early 1990s, he sang on a “celebrity-packedcharity single," "Voices That Care,” to honor U.S. troop ofOperation Desert Storm, the1990–1991 Gulf War, and supporting theInternational Red Cross.[1]The single reached number eleven on theBillboardHot 100, and number six on theHot Adult Contemporary Tracks.[52][53]Through sales and plays of the song Williams and the other celebrities became platinum-recording and Billboard-charting artists.[1]
Williams has been married three times, and has three children, and two grandchildren.[54]His first marriage was to Audrey Sellers in 1959. They were divorced some years later, after which he apparently became depressed. He stated that "there was a period when I was very despondent, broke, depressed, my first marriage was on the rocks."
