Anna(stylized asANИA) is a 2019actionthriller filmwritten, produced and directed byLuc Besson. The film starsSasha Lussas the eponymous assassin, alongsideLuke Evans,Cillian Murphy,Helen Mirren, andAlexander Petrov.
The French production was theatrically released in the United States on 21 June 2019 bySummit Entertainmentand on 10 July 2019 byPathé Distributionin France. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $31 million worldwide against a $30 million budget.
In 1990,[5]Anna, a young Russian woman and victim ofdomestic abuse, will do anything to escape the life she is trapped in. AKGBagent, Alex, discovers Anna's predicament and recruits her as afield agent. After a year of training, she is told that for the next four years, she will work under seniorhandlerOlga; once the five years in total are up, she will be discharged from the agency and can start her life over again. After thecollapse of the Soviet Union, the director of the newly renamedSVR-RF, Vassiliev, refuses to honor the original agreement; because he believes that the only path to retirement is death.
Anna assumes the identity of afashion modeland starts a professional career inParis, while completing various missions and assassinations. To avoid suspicion, she enters alesbianrelationship with fellow model Maude, with the permission of Olga. When theCIAuncovers her true identity, she agrees to work for them as adouble agentwith Agent Leonard Miller as her handler, in exchange for the promise ofpolitical asylumand a new life inHawaii. Miller tasks her with assassinating theanti-AmericanVassiliev, as the CIA believes that whomever succeeds him will improveU.S.-Russian relations. Anna kills Vassiliev while the two play a game ofchessand proceeds to shoot her way out of theLubyanka Building.
She then arranges a meeting with both Alex and Miller, returning information to each that she had previously stolen, but insinuating that a copy had been kept and would be released if anything happened to her. Alex tells her that the information will be stale and worthless in 6 months, but Anna responds that 6 months of freedom was more than she had ever experienced before. By accepting the return of their data both Miller verbally, and Alex tacitly agree to allow Anna to disappear for as long as she can. The meeting area is under surveillance and Olga watches the meeting occur. Shortly after Anna leaves the meeting, Olga catches up to her and shoots her dead for betraying theRussian Federation. Miller and Alex hold each other at gunpoint, with Alex refusing to let Miller help Anna before both men are forced to retreat. Miller then attempts to get video proof that Anna is still alive, but her body is quickly collected by medical personnel before he can do so. It turns out that "Anna" is a body double; the real Anna slips into the sewers, changes her clothes, and removes the wig from her shaved head before vanishing into the shadows.
It is revealed that Olga had earlier revealed to Anna her knowledge of the CIA's planned assassination of Vassiliev. Both women conspired to go along with the CIA's plan as Olga wanted to take Vassiliev's place. As Olga moves into Vassiliev's former office, she views a recorded message left for her by Anna, who expresses her gratitude to Olga but reveals she kept evidence of Olga's involvement in Vassiliev's murder in case her old handler ever betrays their agreement. Olga smiles in admiration and proceeds to delete Anna's file from the SVR's official database.

Principal photographyon the film began in early November 2017 inBelgrade. Other locations were Paris, Moscow,[7][8][9]Milan andGuadeloupe.
Summit Entertainment released the original soundtrack composed byÉric Serraon 19 July 2019.[10]The film also features additional music not included in the soundtrack.[11]
The film was released in the United States on 21 June 2019.[12]It was released on Digital HD on 10 September 2019 and onDVD,Blu-ray, andUltra HD Blu-rayon 24 September 2019.[13]

In the United States and Canada, the film opened alongsideChild's PlayandToy Story 4, and was expected to gross $2–4million from 2,150 theaters in its opening weekend.[2]It made $1.4million on its first day, including $325,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $3.5million, finishing 11th at the box office.[14][15]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 34% based on 71 reviews, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Annafinds writer-director Luc Besson squarely in his wheelhouse, but fans of this variety of stylized action have seen it all done before – and better."[16]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 40 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[17]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an overall positive score of 81% (with an average 4 out of 5 stars).[14]
Peter Debruge ofVarietywrote, "Annashows that Besson is the same filmmaker now that he was 20 years ago, and unlike his title character, who lithely adapts to whatever situation she's in, he's been telling roughly the same story over and over all this time."[18]
Brad Wheeler ofThe Globe and Mailcalled the film "a near-parody non-thriller" and was critical of the story structure: "Anna relies on atime-shifting structurethat is laughably exhausting."[19]
Movie Nation critic Roger Moore gave the film one and a half out of four stars, and wrote: "There are a lot of irritants and clumsy touches to Besson's latest, infuriatingly inferior version ofLa Femme Nikitathat ruin it." Moore criticized the "pointless flashbacks" and the cartoon physics of the fight scenes, though he praised Luss, writing that she "handles the action choreography with skill and emotes better than your average model turned actress".[20]
Noel Murray of theLos Angeles Timespraised the film, "As a slick, over-the-top action picture,Annaworks splendidly" but says the film is overshadowed by Besson's offscreen personal issues.[21]
David Fear ofRolling Stonestated, "This kind ofCold War-a-go-go, deadly-honeypot intrigue is harder to do well than you might think – just ask the folks behindRed Sparrow. So you appreciate it when someone like Besson can make it move like a pro. And despite constantly playing fast and loose with the chronology [...], he delivers a sleek, largely efficient mechanism of adrenaline-soakeddéjà vu."[22]
Bilge Ebiri ofThe New York Timeswrote: "Anna isn't as stylish or gripping asNikita, but it does have its own demented charm, particularly in how it toys with structure, nesting competing narrative timelines within each other."[23]

Luc Paul Maurice Besson(French:[lykbɛsɔ̃]; born 18 March 1959) is a French filmmaker. He directed or produced the filmsSubway(1985),The Big Blue(1988), andLa Femme Nikita(1990). Associated with theCinéma du lookfilm movement, he has been nominated for aCésar Awardfor Best Director and Best Picture for his filmsLéon: The Professional(1994) andThe Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc(1999). He won Best Director and Best French Director for his sci-fi action filmThe Fifth Element(1997). He wrote and directed the sci-fi action filmLucy(2014) and thespace operafilmValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets(2017).
In 1980, near the beginning of his career, he founded his own production company, Les Films du Loup, later renamed Les Films du Dauphin. It was superseded in 2000 when he co-foundedEuropaCorpwith longtime collaboratorPierre-Ange Le Pogam[fr]. As writer, director, or producer, Besson has been involved in the creation ofmore than 50 films.
Besson was born inParis, to parents who both worked asClub Medscuba-divinginstructors.[1]Influenced by this, he planned to become amarine biologist. He spent much of his youth traveling with his parents to tourist resorts inItaly,Yugoslavia, andGreece.[2]The family returned to France when he was 10. His parents divorced, and both remarried; of this, he said:
"Here there is two families, and I am the only bad souvenir of something that doesn't work," he said in theInternational Herald Tribune. "And if I disappear, then everything is perfect. The rage to exist comes from here. I have to do something! Otherwise I am going to die."[3]
At age 17, Besson had a diving accident that left him unable to dive.[4]In a 2000 interview withThe Guardian, he described how this influenced his choice of career:
"I was 17 and I wondered what I was going to do. ... So I took a piece of paper and on the left I put everything I could do, or had skills for, and all the things I couldn't do. The first line was shorter and I could see that I loved writing, I loved images, I was taking a lot of pictures. So I thought maybe movies would be good. But I thought that to really know I should go to a set. And a friend of mine knew a guy whose brother was a third assistant on a short film. It's true. So, I said: 'OK, let's go on the set.' So I went on the set. The day after I went back to see my mum and told her that I was going to make films and stop school and 'bye. And I did it! Very soon after I made a short film and it was very, very bad. I wanted to prove that I could do something, so I made a short film. That was in fact my main concern, to be able to show that I could do one."[5]
Besson reportedly worked on the first drafts ofLe Grand Bleu(The Big Blue) while still in his teens. Out of boredom, he started writing stories, including the background to what he later developed asThe Fifth Element(1997), one of his most popular movies,[6]inspired by theFrench comic bookshe read as a teenager. He directed and co-wrote the screenplay of this science fiction thriller with American screenwriterRobert Mark Kamen.[7]
At 18, Besson returned to his birthplace of Paris, where he took odd jobs in film to get a feel for the industry. He worked as an assistant to directors includingClaude FaraldoandPatrick Grandperret. He directed three short films, a commissioned documentary, and several commercials.[8]He then moved to the United States for three years, but returned to Paris, where he formed his own production company. He first named itLes Films du Loup, then changed it toLes Films du Dauphin.
In the early 1980s, Besson metÉric Serraand asked him to compose the score for his first short film,L'Avant dernier. He subsequently had Serra compose for other films. Since the late 20th century, Besson has written and produced numerous action movies, including theTaxiseries (1998–2007), theTransporterseries (2002–2008; another collaboration with Robert Mark Kamen), and theJet LifilmsKiss of the DragonandUnleashed. His English-language filmsTaken,Taken 2, andTaken 3, all co-written with Kamen and starringLiam Neeson, have been major successes, withTaken 2becoming the largest-grossing export French film.[9]Besson produced the promotional movie for theParis 2012 Olympic bid.[10]
Besson won theLumières Award for Best Director[11]and theCésar Award for Best Director, for his filmThe Fifth Element(1997).[12]He was nominated for Best Director andBest PictureCésar Awardsfor his filmsLéon: The Professional(1994)[13]andThe Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc(1999).[14]French actorJean Renohas appeared in several films by Besson, includingLe dernier combat(1983),[15]Subway(1985),[16][17]The Big Blue(1988),[18]La Femme Nikita(1990), andLéon: The Professional(1994).[17]
In summer 2024, Besson directedDracula: A Love Tale,an adaptation ofDraculastarringCaleb Landry Jonesand featuresChristophe Waltz.[19]
Critics such as Raphaël Bassan and Guy Austin cite Besson as a pivotal figure in theCinéma du lookmovement—a specific, highly visual style produced from the 1980s into the early 1990s.Subway(1985),The Big Blue(1988) andLa Femme Nikita(1990) are all considered of this stylistic school. The term was coined by criticRaphaël Bassanin a 1989 essay inLa Revue du Cinema n° 449.[20]A partisan of the experimental cinema and friend ofNew Wave("nouvelle vague") directors, Bassan grouped Besson withJean-Jacques BeineixandLeos Caraxas three directors who shared the style of"le look".These directors were later critically described as "favouring style over substance, and spectacle over narrative".[21]
Besson, and most of the filmmakers so categorised, were uncomfortable with the label. He contrasted their work with France'sNew Wave. "Jean-Luc GodardandFrançois Truffautwere rebelling against existing cultural values and used cinema as a means of expression simply because it was the most avant-garde medium at the time," said Besson in a 1985 interview inThe New York Times. "Today, the revolution is occurring entirely within the industry and is led by people who want to change the look of movies by making them better, more convincing and pleasurable to watch.
"Because it's becoming increasingly difficult to break into this field, we have developed a psychological armor and are ready to do anything in order to work," he added. "I think our ardor alone is going to shake the pillars of the moviemaking establishment."[22]
Besson directed a biopic ofAung San Suu KyicalledThe Lady(2011) (original titleDans la Lumiere). He also worked onLockout(2012).[23]
Many of Besson's films have achieved popular, if not always critical, success. Reviews were mixed forLe Grand Bleu (The Big Blue).Kevin Thomasof theLos Angeles Timeswrote that the movie was "too long and initially awkward but is clearly the work of a visionary."[24]
"When the film had its premiere on opening night at the1988 Cannes Film Festival, it was mercilessly drubbed, but no matter; it was a smash," observed theInternational Herald Tribunein a 2007 profile of Besson. "Embraced by young people who kept returning to see it again, the movie sold 10 million tickets and quickly became what the French call a 'film générationnel,' a defining moment in the culture."[3]
Besson created the hugely successfulArthur series, which comprisesArthur and the Minimoys,Arthur and the Forbidden City,Arthur and the Vengeance of MaltazardandArthur and the War of the Two Worlds.[25]He directedArthur and the Invisibles, an adaptation of the first two books of the collection, starringMadonnaandRobert DeNiro.[26]Afilm with live action and animation, it was released in the UK and the US, as well as in  France.[26][27][25]
Besson has been described as "the most Hollywood of French filmmakers".[28]Scott Tobias wrote that his "slick, commercial" action movies were "so interchangeable—drugs, sleaze, chucklingsupervillainy, andHong Kong-style effects—that each new project probably starts withwhite-outon the title page."[29]
American film criticArmond Whitehas praised Besson, whom he ranks as one of the best film producers, for refining and revolutionizing action film. He wrote that Besson dramatizes the struggle of his characters "as a conscientious resistance to human degradation".[30]
In 2012, film critic Eric Kohn wrote inIndiewire: "Luc Besson’s filmography has been spotty for years, littered with equal amounts of sensationalistic pop art and flashy duds, a tendency that extends beyond his directing credits."[31]
Besson has been married four times; first, in 1986, to actressAnne Parillaud. They had a daughter, Juliette, born in 1987. Parillaud starred in Besson'sLa Femme Nikita(1990). They divorced in 1991.[32]
Besson's second wife was actress and directorMaïwenn Le Besco, whom he started dating when he was 32 and she was 15 after having met 3 years earlier.[33]They married in late 1992 when Le Besco, 16, was pregnant with their daughterShanna, who was born on 3 January 1993.[34][deprecated source]Le Besco later claimed that their relationship inspired Besson's filmLéon(1994), where the plot involved the emotional relationship between an adult man and a 12-year-old girl (played by then 12-year-oldNatalie Portman).[33]Their marriage ended in 1997, when Besson became involved with actressMilla Jovovich, then 19, during the production ofThe Fifth Element(1997).[35][36][37]"We sensed the special chemistry between us immediately at the auditions and it just intensified during the filming of the movie," said Jovovich.[37]
He married Jovovich on December 14, 1997, when he was 38 and she was 21. They divorced in 1999.[38][37]
On August 28, 2004, at age 45, Besson married film producerVirginie Silla, 32. They have three children,[39]including the actressThalia Besson.[40]
Since 2025, he is in relationship with laywer Sarah Saldmann (fr),[41]thirty-two years[42]younger than him.[43]
In 2018, Dutch-Belgian actressSand Van Roy, who appeared inValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, accused Besson of rape.[44][45][46]
The director's lawyer Thierry Marembert stated that Besson "categorically denies these fantasist accusations" and that the accuser was "someone he knows, towards whom he has never behaved inappropriately".[47][48]
In February 2019, French prosecutors dropped the case against him, citing lack of evidence.[49][45]In December 2021, a judge dismissed the case against Besson following a second investigation.[50]The public prosecutor's office in Paris stated that "the investigations clearly establish that the criminal facts of rape were not committed, that the absence of consent of the civil party is not established and the existence of a constraint, threat, violence, is not characterized".[51]In April 2022, Van Roy submitted a complaint against the magistrate in charge of the case.[52]In June 2023, Besson was definitively cleared of all charges, following a ruling by theCourt of Cassation, the highest judicial court in France. This ruling prevents Van Roy from suing him on the same charges in France or elsewhere in Europe.[53]
Several other women, including a former assistant, two students ofCité du Cinémastudio, and a former employee of Besson'sEuropaCorp, who all wished to remain anonymous, described "inappropriate sexual behavior" by the director.[54]Having no physical evidence to support their stories, they did not press charges and avoided a defamation countersuit. Their stories were not used by theinvestigating judge.[55][56]
Directed features
Among Besson's awards are the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film Critics Prize, Fantasporto Audience Jury Award-Special Mention, Best Director, and Best Film, forLe Dernier Combatin 1983; the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon-Best Director-Foreign Film, forLa Femme Nikita, 1990; theAlexander KordaAward for Best British Film,Nil by Mouth, 1997; and the Best Director Cesar Award, forThe Fifth Element, 1997.[7]
Besson was awarded theInkpot Awardin 2016.[58]
In 2000, Besson superseded his production company by co-founding EuropaCorp with Pierre-Ange Le Pogam, with whom he had frequently worked since 1985. Le Pogam had then been Distribution Director withGaumont. EuropaCorp has had strong growth based on several English-language films, with international distribution. It has production facilities in Paris, Normandy, and Hollywood, and is establishing distribution partnerships in Japan and China.

He later became a diplomat in the service ofNicholas IIand was negotiating an arms deal in Britain when he and his family were stranded by theRussian Revolutionin 1917.[18][19]He settled in London and became a cab driver to support his family.[20]

He later worked as a driving-test examiner, then became a civil servant with theMinistry of Transport.[9][13]In 1951, he changed the family name to Mirren bydeed poll.[22]Mirren considers her upbringing to have been "very anti-monarchist".[23]She was the second of three children; she has an older sister Katherine ("Kate"; born 1942) and had a younger brother Peter Basil (1947–2002).[24]Her paternal cousin wasTania Mallet, a model andBond girl.[25]Mirren was brought up inLeigh-on-Sea, Essex.[26]

Sally Beaumanreported, in her 1982 history of the RSC, that Mirren—while appearing in Nunn'sMacbeth(1974), and in a letter toThe Guardiannewspaper—had sharply criticised both theNational Theatreand the RSC for their lavish production expenditure, declaring it "unnecessary and destructive to the art of the Theatre", and adding, "The realms of truth, emotion and imagination reached for in acting a great play have become more and more remote, often totally unreachable across an abyss of costume and technicalities..." This started a big debate, and led to a question in parliament. There were no discernible repercussions for this rebuke of the RSC.[33][34]
At theWest End'sRoyal Court Theatrein September 1975, she played the role of a rock star named Maggie inTeeth 'n' Smiles, a musical play byDavid Hare; she reprised the role the following year in a revival of the play atWyndham's Theatrein May 1976.

That same year she also won acclaim for her performance in the title role ofJohn Webster'sThe Duchess of Malfi, a production of Manchester'sRoyal Exchange Theatrewhich was later transferred toThe RoundhouseinChalk Farm, London. Reviewing her portrayal forThe Sunday Telegraph,Francis Kingwrote: "Miss Mirren never leaves it in doubt that even in her absences, this ardent, beautiful woman is the most important character of the story." In her performance as Moll Cutpurse inThe Roaring Girl—at theRoyal Shakespeare Theatrein January 1983, and at theBarbican Theatrein April 1983—she was described as having "swaggered through the action with radiant singularity of purpose, filling in areas of light and shade that evenThomas MiddletonandThomas Dekkeromitted." –Michael Coveney,Financial Times, April 1983.[35]During this time, Mirren took roles inCaligula(1979),[36][37]The Long Good Friday(1980)—co-starring withBob Hoskinsin what was her breakthrough film role,[38]Excalibur(1981),2010(1984),White Nights(1985),The Mosquito Coast(1986),Pascali's Island(1988) andWhen the Whales Came(1989).

At the beginning of 1989, Mirren co-starred withBob Peckat theYoung Vicin the London premiere of theArthur Millerdouble-bill,Two Way Mirror, performances which prompted Miller to remark: "What is so good about English actors is that they are not afraid of the open expression of large emotions. British actors like to speak. In London, there's a much more open-hearted kind of exchange between stage and audience" (interview bySheridan Morley:The Times11 January 1989).[39]InElegy for a Ladyshe played the svelte proprietress of a classy boutique, while as the blonde hooker inSome Kind of Love Storyshe was "clad in a Freudian slip and shifting easily from waif-like vulnerability to sexual aggression, giving the role a breathy Monroesque quality".[40]
Mirren is known for her role as detective Jane Tennison in the widely viewedPrime Suspect, a multiple award-winning television drama series that was noted for its high quality and popularity. Her portrayal of Tennison won herthree consecutive British Academy Television Awards for Best Actressbetween 1992 and 1994 (making her one of four actors to have received three consecutiveBAFTA TV Awardsfor a role, alongsideRobbie Coltrane,Julie WaltersandMichael Gambon).[41]Primarily due toPrime Suspect, in 2006 Mirren came 29th onITV's poll ofTV's 50 Greatest Starsvoted by the British public.[42]A further stage breakthrough came in 1994, in anYvonne Arnaud Theatreproduction bound for the West End, whenBill Brydencast her as Natalya Petrovna inIvan Turgenev'sA Month in the Country.

InTeaching Mrs. Tingle(1999), she plays sadistic history teacher Mrs. Eve Tingle.[45]In 1998, Mirren playedCleopatratoAlan Rickman'sAntonyinAntony and Cleopatraat theNational Theatre. The production received poor reviews;The Guardiancalled it "plodding spectacle rarely informed by powerful passion", whileThe Daily Telegraphsaid "the crucial sexual chemistry on which any great production ultimately depends is fatally absent".[46]In 2000Nicholas Hytner, who had worked with Mirren on the film version ofThe Madness of King George, cast her as Lady Torrance in his revival ofTennessee Williams'Orpheus Descendingat theDonmar Warehousein London. Michael Billington, reviewing forThe Guardian, described her performance as "an exemplary study of an immigrant woman who has acquired a patina of resilient toughness but who slowly acknowledges her sensuality."[47]
She portrayedAyn Randin the television film,The Passion of Ayn Rand(1999), where her performance won her anEmmy;Door to Door(2002); andThe Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone(2003). At the National Theatre in November 2003 she again won praise playing Christine Mannon ("defiantly cool, camp and skittish",Evening Standard; "glows with mature sexual allure",Daily Telegraph) in a revival ofEugene O'Neill'sMourning Becomes Electradirected byHoward Davies. "This production was one of the best experiences of my professional life, The play was four and a half hours long, and I have never known that kind of response from an audience ... It was the serendipity of a beautifully cast play, with great design and direction, It will be hard to be in anything better."[28]She played the title role inJean Racine'sPhèdreat the National in 2009, in a production directed byNicholas Hytner. The production was also staged at theEpidaurus amphitheatreon 11 and 12 July 2009.

I was only doing what the [casting] agent asked me – and for this I get reviled!
