The Farewellis a 2019 Americancomedy-drama film, written and directed byLulu Wang. It starsAwkwafina,Tzi Ma,Diana Lin, andZhao Shuzhen. The film follows aChinese Americanwoman named Billi, who learns her grandmother (referred to as Nai Nai) has only a short while left to live. Billi's family has decided to schedule a family wedding before Nai Nai dies to enable her to see all the family one last time and not tell Nai Nai of her fatal illness.
The film is based in part on director Wang's life experiences, which she first publicly discussed as part of her radio story "What You Don't Know", which appeared as part of an episode ofThis American Life.
The Farewellpremiered at theSundance Film Festivalon January 25, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 12 byA24. It received widespread acclaim from critics, with particular praise for Wang's screenplay and the performances of Awkwafina and Zhao Shuzhen. At the77th Golden Globe Awardsthe film was nominated for two awards includingBest Foreign Language Film, with Awkwafina winning forBest Actress.The Farewellhas dialogue in both English andMandarin Chinese.
Aspiring Chinese-American writer Billi maintains a close relationship with her Nai Nai (paternal grandmother) who lives inChangchun, China. After receiving a rejection letter for aGuggenheim Fellowship, she discovers from her parents, Haiyan and Jian, that Nai Nai has been diagnosed withterminallung cancer, and is predicted to have only a few months left to live.
Through deception and manipulation of medical test results, the diagnosis is kept a secret from Nai Nai herself. She is, instead, falsely told that her recent doctor visits have only revealedbenign findings. A wedding for Billi's cousin from Japan, Hao Hao, has been planned in China as an excuse to unite the family to spend what is expected to be one last time with Nai Nai. Fearing Billi will end up exposing the lie to her grandmother, Haiyan and Jian tell her to remain in New York City.
Billi disobeys her parents' orders and flies to Changchun shortly after the rest of the family arrive. She assures her parents that she will not reveal the cancer diagnosis to Nai Nai. Throughout the trip, however, she clashes with the rest of the family over their deliberate dishonesty towards her grandmother. Guilt-ridden, Billi expresses conflicted thoughts with her parents over the Chinese cultural beliefs that result in a family refusing to disclose a life-threatening disease, including the trauma of her grandfather passing away without her knowledge after they moved to the United States.
One night, her uncle, Haibin, contends that the lie allows the family to bear the emotional burden of the diagnosis, rather than Nai Nai herself—a practice ofcollectivismthat he acknowledges differs from the individualistic values common in Western culture. Billi later learns that Nai Nai also told a similar lie to her husband up until his death when he was terminally ill.
On the day of the wedding, both Haibin and Hao Hao break down in tears on separate occasions but manage to proceed through the banquet without raising Nai Nai's suspicions. Billi intercepts Nai Nai's medical test results from the hospital and has it altered to reflect a clean bill of health, helping to maintain the lie.
That night, Nai Nai gives Billi ahóngbāo, encouraging her to spend the money as she chooses. Billi admits that she wants to stay in Changchun to spend more time with Nai Nai, but Nai Nai declines, telling her that she needs to live her own life. When Billi reveals the Guggenheim Fellowship rejection to her, Nai Nai encourages Billi to keep an open mind and not get hung up on this failure, "don't be the bull endlessly ramming its horns into the corner of the room." She says that "life is not about what things one does, but more so about how one goes about doing them".
Billi keeps her promise to maintain the lie. She shares a tearful goodbye with Nai Nai as the visiting family members return to their homes in Japan and America. A title card reveals that six years after her diagnosis, the woman Nai Nai's character was based on is still alive and still unaware of her sickness.[3]
Lulu Wangfaced obstacles when pitching her film about aChinese Americanfamily. She says she had many disheartening encounters with American and Chinese financiers who wanted to include a "prominent white character into the narrative and punch up the nuanced drama to turn it into a broad comedy."[4]
Wang later created an episode titled "What You Don't Know" forThis American Lifein April, 2016 based on her family's story. This caught the attention of producer Chris Weitz who helped secure financing for the film.[5][4]
Wang said that the film was based on her grandmother's illness, stating that "I always felt the divide in my relationship to my family versus my relationship to my classmates and to my colleagues and to the world that I inhabit. That's just the nature of being an immigrant and straddling two cultures."[6]
The film was primarily shot inChangchun, China, over the course of 24 days in June 2018.[7][8]Filming also took place inNew York.[9]In an interview withFilmmaker, cinematographer Anna Franquesa Solano stated that the references for the film includedForce MajeureandStill Walking.[9]However, she added that her main source of inspiration came from "spending time with Lulu's family at their home in Changchun, during pre-production."[9]
Director Lulu Wang says that she kept the secret from her grandmother during and after film production. It was awkward to keep the secret when the grandmother visited the filming, a block from her home. Wang claims her grandmother eventually found out when a friend sent her a review of the film.[10]
The film had its premiere in the U.S. Dramatic Competition section at the2019 Sundance Film Festivalon January 25, 2019.[11]In January 2019,A24acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film for $7 million, overNetflix,Amazon Studios, andFox Searchlight Pictures.[11][12]It was released in the United States on July 12, 2019.[13]A fully Chinese-subtitled version of the film played in select theaters on September 8, 2019.[14]
The Farewellgrossed $17.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $5.4 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $23.1 million,[2]against a production budget of $3 million.[1]
In its opening weekend the film made $355,662 from four theaters for an average of $88,916 per venue; at the time, it was the best average of 2019, bestingAvengers: Endgame's $76,601.[15]It expanded to 35 theaters in its second weekend and earned $1.14 million,[16]then made $1.5 million from 135 theaters in its third.[17]It continued to expand in the following weeks, making $2.4 million from 426 theaters and then $2.2 million from 705 theaters.[18][19]The film expanded further to over 800 theaters in the next few weeks, $1.4 million from 861 theaters, $882,623 from 816 theaters and $841,414 from 891 theaters.[20][21]
The Farewellwas a box office "flop" in China, grossing only $580,000 by January 2020 in what was then the world's second-largest film market.[22]According toSixth Tone, the film's delayed theatrical release—to prevent it from being lost in the hype surrounding Disney’sFrozen 2—was a big factor in the low gross since many in China had already seen it abroad or online.[23]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97%, with an average rating of 8.5/10, based on 345 reviews. The website's critics' consensus reads: "The Farewelldeftly captures complicated family dynamics with a poignant, well-acted drama that marries cultural specificity with universally relatable themes."[24]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on 47 critic reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".[25]OnIMDb, the film received a rating of 7.5/10, based on 73k reviews.[26]
Eric Kohn ofIndieWiregave the film an A− grade and praised Awkwafina's performance, writing, "As a Chinese-American grappling with the traditionalism of her past and its impact on the future, she's an absorbing engine for the movie's introspective look at a most unusual family reunion."[27]Christy Lemirewriting forRogerEbert.comgave the film 4 out of 4 stars, saying Zhao Shuzhen is "the most frequent source of laughs", but went on to say that "as delightful as [Zhao] is in this crucial, central role, she will also quietly rip your heart out by the film's end".[28]
Richard LawsonofVanity Fairwrote, "Wang movingly tells not just a story about the negotiations of familial love, but also of the immigrant experience, of revisiting one's homeland to, in some senses, say goodbye to it."[29]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reportercommented, "its moments of sweet sentimentality are fully earned and heartfelt."[30]Brian Lowry ofCNN.comdescribed it as a "small, melancholy movie that explores cultural differences and dealing with death in an utterly charming, understated manner."[31]Hong Kong playwrightJingan Youngcommented on the film's depiction of the differences between western and Chinesefamily values, claiming that "the family’s decision to tell a 'good lie' is a metaphor for the collective delusion of living under theChinese Communist party."[32][33]

During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, A24 was approved to continue filming and promotional activities since they do not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP).[57]
In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

Wang studied music and literature atBoston Collegefrom 2001 and graduated in 2005 with a double major in literature and music.[9]Wang says she was inspired to become a filmmaker after watchingSteven Shainberg's2002 filmSecretaryin her senior year.[10]She then took twofilm productioncourses and made several short films while still at college.[11]After learning the art of film and producing a few short student films and documentaries, Wang moved to Hollywood in 2007 to fully pursue her love for writing.
Filmmaking found itself early in Wang's career, but instead of movie theaters her content was exhibited in courtrooms. Shown for mediation and court cases, she created short “day in the life” videos for legal firms for her startup business, capturing injured victims’ daily struggles in mundane activities. She interviewed many clients and their families in an attempt to show the extent of their injuries.[12]
In 2005, while still a student, Wang received the Best Beginning Film Award at the Boston College Baldwin Awards forStoryteller, which she made together with fellow Boston College student Tony Hale.[11][13]They went on to win the Baldwin Award for Best Picture for the short filmPisces[14]at the Boston College Baldwin Film Festival the following year.[15]Wang and Hale also collaborated on the 2006 documentary short,Fishing the Gulf, on over-fishing inPanama.[11][16]Her next project was the 2007 short filmCan-Can,[17]based on a short story byArturo Vivanteabout marriage and infidelity.[11]
In 2008, shortly after moving to Los Angeles, Wang interned for a producer alongside Bernadette Bürgi. After a trip toIKEA, the two decided to make a film together due to their mutual affection for storytelling and romantic comedies.[18]Wang and Bürgi set up their own production company Flying Box Productions;[19]Wang directed multiple web shorts and music videos and, in 2014, her first feature film,Posthumous.[20]Set inBerlin, Germany,Posthumousis an American-German co-production starringBrit MarlingandJack Huston.[21]Wang was so dedicated to having Huston in the film, she wrote a heartfelt letter to him, which he later admitted was the reason he signed on to the first-time writer/director's project. The film debuted at theZurich Film Festivalon 4 October 2014,[22]played in the U.S. at theMiami International Film Festival,[23]and has been released worldwide.
In 2014, Wang was awarded theChazandRoger EbertDirecting Fellowship at theFilm Independent Spirit Awards.

In January 2019, Wang's second feature film,The Farewell,premiered at theSundance Film Festival, where it was picked up for worldwide distribution byA24.[33]The film follows struggling New York City artist Billi (played byAwkwafinain her first dramatic role), who travels to China for a family reunion to visit her dying grandmother. The family has decided to keep the truth about her condition a secret from Nai Nai (Mandarin for "grandmother") and sets up a wedding as a pretense for their reunion.[34][35]Wang based the film on her own grandmother's illness, which also included her family setting up a wedding as a pretense; the film opens with a title card statingBased on an actual lie.[34][36][37]The film is presented for the most part inMandarin Chinesewith English subtitles. It was filmed in the neighborhood where Wang's grandmother lived and Wang cast her actual great aunt Lu Hong to play herself in the film.[35]After its Sundance premiere, numerous publications listedThe Farewellas a standout at the festival, includingVariety,[38]Thrillist,[39]andRolling Stone.[40]Despite being an award winning film now, Lulu Wang struggled with American Financiers when pitching the movie The Farewell. It was suggested to Wang that she added a prominent white character into her movie and to switch the genre of the movie from drama to comedy. Even when pitching the movie to a Chinese financier, incorporating a white character was suggested. “People are so influenced by Hollywood” Wang says and she strived to break out that box by refusing to “whitewash” the film.
In an IndieWire critics survey published after the festival,The Farewellwas voted Best Film and Best Screenplay and Wang was voted Best Director.[41]The film holds a 99% Critics Consensus rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 207 reviews.[42]
In January 2019,Varietynamed Wang one of ten "Directors to Watch." In an interview with the publication, she described her next project as "very grounded science fiction."[43]
The Farewellopened in limited release in four US theaters on July 12, 2019. The film opened to a gross of $351,330, averaging $87,833 per theater, surpassing the average ofAvengers: Endgamewhich averaged $76,601 in 4,662 theaters for a gross of $357,115,007 on its opening weekend.[44]The Farewellwas released nationwide in the US on August 2, 2019.[45]
The film attracted less interest in China, however, leadingVarietyto label it a box office "flop" in China, then the world's second-largest film market.[46]
On December 4, 2019, theAmerican Film Instituteannounced thatThe Farewellwas one of that year's ten recipients of the2019 AFI Awardsfor "films that are culturally and artistically representative" of 2019's "most significant achievements in the art of the moving image."[47]
For her role as Billi, Awkwafina was awarded theGolden Globe AwardforBest Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedyon January 5, 2020.The Farewellwon theIndependent Spirit Award for Best Featureat the35th Independent Spirit AwardsinSanta Monica, Californiaon February 8, 2020.[48]When awarded for her movieThe Farewell, Wang dedicated her speech to talk about the lack of female director nominees. Wang states programs and encouragement are not "enough" and that the filmmaking industry needs to give women more jobs. Lulu Wang further emphasized the importance of making the same bets on female filmmakers as they do with male filmmakers.
On January 28, 2021Applereleased an 11-minute short film calledNianwritten and directed by Wang, celebrating the 2021Chinese New Year. The short film was shot in its entirety using aniPhone 12 Pro Max.[49][50]
Wang's next project is a film adaptation ofAlexander Weinstein'scollection of science fiction short stories,Children of the New World. She has said that the project "centers on questions of family."[51]
Most recently, she, along with Dani Melia had launched Local Time Productions, with a first-look deal at Amazon Studios.[52]
Wang is fluent in English and Mandarin Chinese and also speaks some Spanish.[53]She began dating fellow filmmakerBarry Jenkinsin 2018.[1]In December 2024, they were married at a private ceremony.[54]
Cinematic influences were limited for Wang's filmThe Farewell.Previewed in her roadblocks to find financiers, producing a narrative that authentically communicated the Asian immigrant experience was considered new territory and there were few to none “comps” or comparatives, to guarantee its success. Because there were few films with which to compare the narrative, Wang's main influences were her family. In an attempt to curate and maintain authenticity, she requested her father to read the script and repeatedly asked “does this feel like I am properly representing everyone”.[55]Through his perspective, the mundaneness garnered questions about interest and why the narrative was not dramatized further to satiate Western audiences.
When filmingThe Farewellin particular, the autobiographical narrative required an inquisitional approach to writing and directing, forcing Wang to take on a role not dissimilar to a journalist in an attempt to extract the raw emotions her family members experienced in regards to maintaining the lie about Nai Nai's illness as well as the identity struggle of being a hyphenate.  In fact, amidst production Wang's family expressed uncertainty in her narrative claiming there are things she “doesn’t know enough about China to write the story”, evoking a sense of responsibility to research and interrogate further about her grandmother's history and her individual family members’ perspectives.[56]An interview process ensued in an attempt to absorb as much authenticity as possible, sometimes provoking painful memories. Lu Hong, Wang's real great aunt, was cast as herself, evoking palpable emotional conflict in her performance, but also giving feedback behind the screen on accuracy, easing ethical quandaries and providing emotional support.[55]
Wang's newest endeavor is anAmazonseries in collaboration with producer and actressNicole Kidmancalled “Expats”, based on the novelThe ExpatriatesbyJanice YK Lee. Bound by a sudden tragedy, three American women from Hong Kong form a complex bond that proves to be ever changing. Wang remarks on the series as an “examination of privilege, in many different ways whether it’s race, class, colorism” and expresses her excitement in the newly acquired creative freedom.[55]
In a 2022 poll withSight and Sound, Wang named these ten films as her favorite.[57]
