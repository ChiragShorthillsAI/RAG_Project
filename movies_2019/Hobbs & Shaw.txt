It starsDwayne JohnsonandJason Statham, alongsideIdris Elba,Vanessa Kirby,Eiza González,Cliff Curtis, andHelen Mirren. In the film, Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw join Shaw's younger sister Hattie Shaw to take down Brixton Lore (Elba), a cybernetically enhanced terrorist, who is threatening the world with a deadly virus.
Franchise star and producerVin Dieselsaid in 2015 that possible spin-offs were in early development, andHobbs & Shawwas officially announced in October 2017. Leitch signed on to direct in April 2018, with Kirby and Elba joining the cast three months later.Principal photographyran from September 2018 to January 2019, with locations includingLondon,Glasgow, andKaua'i. The film was subject to controversy after longtermFast & FuriousproducerNeal H. Moritzfiled a lawsuit againstUniversal Picturesfor breach of oral contract and committing promissory fraud related to his role onHobbs & Shaw, which was eventually settled in September 2020 and he received a producer credit onF9.
An international co-production between the United States and Japan,[3][4]Hobbs & Shawpremiered at theDolby TheatreinHollywoodon July 13, 2019, and was theatrically released by Universal Pictures in the United States on August 2, 2019. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its action sequences and the chemistry between Johnson and Statham, but found it underwhelming when compared to otherFast & Furiousfilms. It was a box office success, grossing $760.7 million worldwide on a budget of $200 million.
InLondon,MI6agent Hattie Shaw and her team attempt to retrieve a programmable supervirus nicknamedSnowflakefromEteon, a techno-terrorist organization. The team secures Snowflake, but is attacked by Brixton Lore, an ex-MI6 agent and Eteon operative, who has cybernetic implants allowing him to perform superhuman feats. Brixton kills every agent except Hattie, who injects herself with the only dose of Snowflake before escaping. Brixton frames Hattie for killing her team and stealing Snowflake, forcing her to go on the run.
Luke Hobbsis an ex-DSSagent andDeckard Shaw, Hattie's older brother, is an ex-MI6 agent. They are informed of the missing virus and, after arguing due to their past as fierce rivals, reluctantly work together to track it down. After a brief meeting at aCIAblack siteat122 Leadenhall Street, Deckard goes to Hattie's apartment for information, but he is attacked by Eteon operatives. Luke finds Hattie, who instigates a fight with him, but Luke manages to bring her to a CIA office. As Deckard arrives and informs Luke that Hattie is his sister, the office is attacked by Eteon forces.
Hattie is kidnapped by Brixton, whom Deckard recognizes as an old colleague-turned-enemy he thought that he killed. Luke and Deckard rescue Hattie and evade Brixton during an ensuing car chase. However, Brixton frames all three as criminals via Eteon's control of globalnews media. The three locate Snowflake's creator Prof. Andreiko and learn that he purposed it to efficiently deliver vaccines; to prevent Eteon from using it to eradicate humanity, Hattie must either be cremated, while the virus is still dormant or have it removed with a specialized extraction device located at Eteon's facility inChernobyl. Despite Luke briefly being detained at the airport due to Deckard giving him the fake nameMike Oxmaul, the three manage to travel toMoscow.
After rendezvousing with Deckard's ex-girlfriend Margarita to rearm in Moscow, the three infiltrate the facility. They retrieve the device before escaping in a truck during the facility's destruction, but Andreiko is killed by Brixton and the device is damaged. Luke takes Deckard and Hattie to his childhood home inSamoato visit his estranged brother Jonah, a talented mechanic, to repair the device and lay low before confronting Brixton's forces again. Luke has a tense reunion with his family, to whom he has not spoken since he gave up his criminal father to the authorities. Despite Jonah's objections, their mother convinces him to help repair the device and oppose Eteon's incoming forces.
The makeshift battalion prepares for Eteon's arrival, disabling the weapons used by Eteon's team by temporarily shutting down their authorization code and setting up a variety of traps around the island. Jonah successfully repairs the device and starts the virus extraction just as Brixton and his army arrive. In the ensuing battle, the Samoans engage and easily overpower Brixton's reinforcements, while suffering minimal casualties. Brixton recaptures Hattie with a helicopter, but the Samoans join Luke and Deckard in bringing the aircraft down with several custom trucks. Luke and Deckard alternate their attacks to defeat Brixton, who is later killed remotely by Eteon's unseen director. The director sends a message claiming to know Luke and intending to persuade him and the Shaw siblings, while Luke and Deckard promise to track down the director. The group later celebrates their victory.
Inpost-credits scenes, Luke brings his daughter to meet extended family in Samoa, while Deckard and Hattie are implied to break their mother out of prison. Luke receives a call from his partner Locke, who has broken into a laboratory and discovered a more threatening virus. Luke also sets thepolice in Londonon Deckard in retaliation for the Mike Oxmaul prank, telling the police that Deckard's name is Hugh Janus.

They worked on the big action sequences in London, Chernobyl and a part of the climatic Samoan chase. The London chase sequence consists of blue screen environments and car interiors, with CGI reflections on the McLaren exterior. There are few head replacements and full CGI character doubles. For the latter, they were created and animated from reference photography of the main actors. The same method was applied for the McLaren and the Brixton bikes. Idris Elba was enhanced to give him super-human abilities. Motion graphics were used to make a sort of heads up display of data and stats called the Brixton vision, to help him in the fights. For the Chernobyl action sequence, the environments were made from Lidar scanning, texture reference of a decommissioned coal power plant used for the production shootings. Then, they extended parts of the facility and modified weather conditions. Drones were fully created and animated. Explosions were created too. Finally, they handled the Samoa chopper destruction.
Framestore handled 264 VFX shots for the project, mostly the 3rd-act chase sequence. They photographed the Nā Pali Coast on the North Side of Kauai, Hawaii before and during the main shoot. Then, they used their photography to be photo scanned and transferred into a CGI version of the coastline. They had to fit the CGI environment to the shoot location. They also created CGI cliffs, CGI foliage and some scattered rocks on flatter areas or ledges. Finally for the creation of the environments, they used many reference plate shots for the blue screens. They also photographed, photo scanned, modeled and animated all the vehicles portrayed in that sequence, including the Peterbilt, the M37, the Ratrod and the Black Hawk. The latter was cyber scanned by ClearAngle. They adapted the CGI vehicles with the environment, including the lighting, tillable textures and painting scratches. Finally, they enhanced the explosions and car crashes with some debris, fire elements and craters.

In her performance as Moll Cutpurse inThe Roaring Girl—at theRoyal Shakespeare Theatrein January 1983, and at theBarbican Theatrein April 1983—she was described as having "swaggered through the action with radiant singularity of purpose, filling in areas of light and shade that evenThomas MiddletonandThomas Dekkeromitted." –Michael Coveney,Financial Times, April 1983.[35]During this time, Mirren took roles inCaligula(1979),[36][37]The Long Good Friday(1980)—co-starring withBob Hoskinsin what was her breakthrough film role,[38]Excalibur(1981),2010(1984),White Nights(1985),The Mosquito Coast(1986),Pascali's Island(1988) andWhen the Whales Came(1989).

British actors like to speak.
