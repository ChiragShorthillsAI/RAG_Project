Yesterdayis a 2019jukebox musicalromantic comedyfilm directed byDanny Boyleand written byRichard Curtisbased on a story byJack Barthand Curtis.Himesh Patelstars as struggling musician Jack Malik, who suddenly finds himself as the only person who remembersthe Beatlesand becomes famous for performing their songs. The film also starsLily James,Joel Fry,Ed Sheeran, andKate McKinnon.
Yesterdaywas announced in March 2018. Filming began the following month around England, particularlyNorfolkandHalesworthin Suffolk. Photography also took place atWembley Stadium, thePrincipality Stadium, and in Los Angeles. The filmmakers paid $10 million for the rights to usethe Beatles' music. Although none of the band members were involved, Boyle received approval for the project from them or their families.
Yesterdayhad its world premiere at theTribeca Film Festivalin May 2019, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States in June 2019, byUniversal Pictures. The film grossed $153 million worldwide against a production budget of $26 million. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the premise, performances, and musical sequences but criticism for its familiarity and not exploring the concept further.
Jack Malik is a struggling singer-songwriter fromLowestoftwho plays gigs to tiny audiences. His manager and childhood friend Ellie Appleton encourages him not to give up on his dreams. Jack is hit by a bus during a 12-second global power failure. After recovering, he sings theBeatlessong "Yesterday" for his friends and discovers that they have never heard of the Beatles.
Jack searches for the Beatles on the Internet but finds nothing, then he discovers the band's records missing from his collection, and he realises that he is now living in a world without the group. He begins performing Beatles songs, passing them off as his own.
Ellie has Jack record a demo with Gavin, a local music producer. Following a performance on local television, Jack is invited by pop starEd Sheeranto play as his opening act inMoscow. Ellie is a mathematics teacher who has a parent's evening scheduled, and she declines to join him, so Jack's friend Rocky travels with him instead. After the gig, Sheeran challenges Jack to a songwriting duel; Jack plays "The Long and Winding Road", and Sheeran accepts defeat.
In Los Angeles, Sheeran's ruthless manager Debra Hammer signs Jack to her label and engineers his rise to global fame. Ellie confesses that she has always been in love with him at his going-away party prior to moving to Los Angeles. Jack starts recording an album atEastWest Studios, but he cannot remember the lyrics for "Eleanor Rigby". Hoping to trigger memories, he goes to the Beatles' hometown of Liverpool, visiting landmarks such asStrawberry Field,Penny Lane, and the grave ofEleanor Rigby.
Ellie joins Jack in Liverpool, and they share a drunken evening and kiss, but she tells him that she is not interested in a one-night stand. The next morning, Jack and Rocky pursue Ellie tothe train station, where she congratulates Jack but tells him that she cannot be a part of his celebrity life. He returns to Los Angeles heartbroken and desperate to have an everyday life again, while Ellie begins dating Gavin.
The record label prepares to launch Jack's debut album, but they reject his title ideas—taken from Beatles albums—and names itOne Man Only, pushing his talent. Jack persuades them to launch the album witha rooftop concertinGorleston-on-Sea.
Two people who also recall the Beatles approach him backstage. They tell him that they know that he did not write the songs, but thank him, having feared that the Beatles' music was gone forever. They give him the address ofJohn Lennon, who never became a big star in this reality and has lived a long, happy life with his wife out of the public spotlight. Jack then visits John, who advises him to pursue the one he loves and always tell the truth.
Jack calls in a favour with Sheeran, who arranges for him to perform atWembley Stadium. Jack confesses to the crowd that he plagiarised the music and that he loves Ellie, and he has Rocky upload the songs free on the internet, sabotaging the record release and enraging Debra. Jack and Ellie return to her home and finally make love. In the morning, Jack equates his feelings for Ellie with howHarry Pottermust have felt when he defeatedLord Voldemort, but Ellie has no idea who he is talking about, much to Jack's chagrin. They decide to start a family, and Jack gives up stardom to become a music teacher.
In addition,James CordenandMichael Kiwanukaappear as themselves, andRobert Carlylemakes an uncredited appearance as a 78-year-old contentedJohn Lennon.[1]
Yesterdaywas produced byPerfect World Pictures,Working Title Films, Decibel Films andDentsu Inc.,[2]and distributed byUniversal Pictures.[3]
Yesterdaybegan as a 2012 screenplay,Cover Version,by the American writerJack Barth. Barth had been struggling to sell screenplays for decades. He conceived the story when it occurred to him that ifStar Warshad not been created and he conceived it, he would not be able to sell it. In Barth's script, a "meditation on professional disappointment", Jack did not find success with the Beatles songs.[4]
The British actorMackenzie Crookworked on an early version of the script, and intended to direct the film.[5]He left to work on his television seriesDetectorists.[6]The script was passed to the production companyWorking Title. Years later, while working on clearance rights for the Beatles songs, a Working Title producer mentioned the screenplay to the British filmmakerRichard Curtis, who bought it and rewrote it as aromantic comedy. On Curtis's insistence,[4]the screenplay is credited to Curtis and the story credited to Curtis and Barth.[7]
Curtis told interviewers he did not read Barth's script, preferring to use the premise to write his own version.[4]He toldDen of Geek: "I sometimes found when I worked with original material that it doesn't come from the heart. So I tried to write a whole film that meant something to me, rather than having too much extra information."[8]However, according to Barth, the final film includes many elements of his screenplay, includingJohn Lennonas a wizened fisherman and a joke aboutHarry Potter. Curtis credited theHarryPotterjoke to a suggestion from the American comedianSarah Silverman, who is thanked in the credits.[4]
Barth complained that Curtis had taken sole credit for the screenplay and damaged him financially. He felt that Curtis had changed the story to make Jack a successful songwriter as a reflection of Curtis's own career: "[Curtis] metRowan Atkinsonat Oxford, he came out of Oxford and immediately rode Rowan Atkinson to huge success in his early twenties. He's never been knocked out, as far as I know. Whywouldn't[Jack] become the most successful songwriter in the world?"[4]
In March 2018, it was announced that Curtis and directorDanny Boylewere working on a musical comedy set in the 1960s or 1970s following "a struggling musician who thinks he's the only person who can remember the Beatles", withHimesh Patelcast in the lead role.[9]Boyle was convinced Patel was the right choice after listening to him perform the Beatles songs "Yesterday" and "Back in the U.S.S.R." during auditions.[10]Boyle felt that Patel's voice had soul.[11]Patel sang and performed guitar and piano himself.[12]
Later in March 2018,Lily JamesandKate McKinnonjoined the cast.[13][14]Boyle informed the surviving members and widows of the Beatles about the film and received a reply he described as "lovely" from Beatles drummerRingo Starr.[15]In April 2018, it was revealed thatEd Sheeranhad joined the cast.[16][17]Sheeran's role was originally intended for theColdplaysingerChris Martin, who turned it down.[11]Sheeran saidHarry Styleswas also asked, which Boyle denied.[18]Ana de ArmasandLamorne Morrisjoined later in April,[19][20]followed bySophia Di Martino,Joel Fryand Harry Michell in May.[21]
Filming began on 21 April 2018,[22]with production in the United Kingdom starting on 26 April 2018, with scenes filmed across East Anglia inCantley,Halesworth,Dunwich,Shingle Street, at theLatitude Festival, and atClacton-on-Sea.[23]A casting call was issued for extras in overnight scenes shot immediately after Sheeran's four consecutive concerts at thePrincipality StadiuminCardiff,Walesin May 2018.[24]A further 5,000 extras appeared in scenes atGorleston-on-SeaBeach inNorfolkin June 2018.[25]Wembley Stadiumwas also used to film a concert scene.[15]Filming also took place inLiverpool, making use ofPenny Lane,Liverpool John Lennon Airport,Lime Street Stationand theQueensway Tunnel.[26]
In February 2019, it was announced that the title of the film wasYesterday.[27]It is estimated to have cost around $10 million to get the rights for the Beatles' songs to be featured in the film, with the rights to their music being held byApple RecordsandSony/ATV Music Publishing.[28]Scenes with de Armas, who played another love interest for Jack, were cut as test audiences felt it made Jack less sympathetic.[29]Ana de Armas appeared in some of the early promotional material before the final edit was made, which led to a $5m lawsuit in the US[30]when two fans claimed they were "duped into renting the [$3.99] movie because she [de Armas] was in the trailer".[31]U.S. District JudgeStephen Wilsonallowed the class-action lawsuit to proceed in December 2022, stating that "At its core, a trailer is an advertisement designed to sell a movie by providing consumers with a preview of the movie."[32]Wilson later dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the "injury is self-inflicted" and thus no standing to sue.[33]By April 2024, the two men had settled with Universal over court fees.[34]
The soundtrack toYesterdaywas released byCapitol Recordson the 21st of June 2019, 7 days before the United Kingdom and United States release of the movie.
Yesterdayfeatured several Beatles songs performed by Patel, withAdem Ilhanas the film'smusic supervisor.[35]Licensing the Beatle's discography cost the producers of the movie close to $10 million.[36]
Daniel Pemberton is the film composer forYesterday. According to Pemberton, "The idea was to get him comfortable with the songs and getting him to the stage where basically he could play Wembley Stadium."[37]He worked with Patel to cover each song with a "very raw, human performance" style, as Boyle liked it,[37]and refrained from over-produced sounds.
The first official trailer of the film was released on 12 February 2019.[38]The film had its world premiere at theTribeca Film Festivalon 4 May 2019.[39]A local screening of the film took place at theGorleston Palacecinema on 21 June 2019.[40]Universal spent $75.4 million promoting the film worldwide.[41]
Yesterdaygrossed $73.3million in the United States and Canada and $81.3million in other territories (including $19.4million in the United Kingdom),[42]for a worldwide total of $154.6million, against a production budget of $26million.[43]It spent its first five weeks in the Top 10 at the domestic box office.[44]
In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $10–15 million from 2,603 theatres in its opening weekend.[45]The film made $6.1 million on its first day, including $1.25 million from Thursday night previews. It ended up slightly exceeding projections and debuting to $17 million, finishing third behindToy Story 4andAnnabelle Comes Home.[46]In its second weekend the film made $10.7 million, again finishing in third (behindSpider-Man: Far From HomeandToy Story 4),[47]then grossed $6.8 million in its third weekend, falling to fifth.[48]
Deadline Hollywoodcalculated the net profit of the film to be $45million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues and ignoring the UK tax credits on the production cost.[49]Universalofficially tookan $87.8 million loss on the film in 2019, whichDeadlinededuced would eventually result in a $26.5 million profit after TV and video sales (an estimated$78.4 millionby early 2020) were taken into account.[41]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 63% of 366 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's consensus reads: "Yesterdaymay fall short of fab, but the end result is still a sweetly charming fantasy with an intriguing—albeit somewhat under-explored—premise."[50]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 55 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[51]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A-" on an A+ to F scale.[52]
Peter BradshawofThe Guardiangave the film four out of five stars, writing "although this film can be a bit hokey and uncertain on narrative development, the puppyish zest and fun summoned up by Curtis and Boyle carry it along."[53]Robbie Collinalso responded positively in his review forThe Daily Telegraph, saying the film "rallies in style for a beautifully judged and surprisingly moving finale, which owes a lot to Patel and James's chemistry."[54]Owen GleibermanofVariety, meanwhile, was less enthusiastic, claiming the film had little soul and calling it a "rom-com wallpapered with the Beatles' greatness."[55]Laura Snapes ofThe GuardiancalledYesterday"the latest jukebox movie to put its women on mute."[56]
Paul McCartney revealed in an interview withBillboardthat he and his wifeNancy Shevellwent to see the film in a cinema inThe Hamptonsand "loved it".[57]Boyle also sent copies of the completed film to Ringo Starr and his wifeBarbara, as well as George Harrison's widowOlivia, and received "lovely messages" from both parties.[58]John Lennon's widow,Yoko Ono, also approved of the film's depiction of her late husband.[59]
Motive NYC
As remarked upon in the media, a number of other works have had a similar premise or theme[60][61]involvingparallel worldsortime travel. The 2010 JapanesemangaI'm a Beatle(僕はビートルズ,Boku wa Bītoruzu)by Tetsuo Fujii andKaiji Kawaguchi[62]involves an almost identical concept of a musician travelling back in time to 1961 and being surprised when he plays "Yesterday" and no one knows of the Beatles; he similarly plays their material and is successful. Others include the 2011 Frenchgraphic novelYesterdayby David Blot and Jérémie Royer (the title, again, alluding to the Beatles song),[63][64][65]the 1990s British sitcomGoodnight Sweetheart,[66]the 2006 French filmJean-Philippe,[67][68]and Nick Milligan's 2013 novelEnormity.[69]Danny Boyle has said he was not aware of earlier works with similar premises when he read the script but had later become aware of a French film and British sitcom with a similar premise after the film's first trailer was revealed.[11]

Daniel Francis Boyle(born 20 October 1956) is an English director and producer. He is known for his work on the filmsShallow Grave(1994),Trainspotting(1996) and its sequelT2 Trainspotting(2017),The Beach(2000),28 Days Later(2002),Sunshine(2007),Slumdog Millionaire(2008),127 Hours(2010),Steve Jobs(2015), andYesterday(2019).
Boyle's debut filmShallow Gravewon theBAFTA Award for Best British Film. TheBritish Film InstituterankedTrainspottingthe10th greatest British film of the 20th century. Boyle's 2008 crime drama filmSlumdog Millionaire, the most successful British film of the decade, was nominated for tenAcademy Awardsand won eight, including theAcademy Award for Best Director. He also won theGolden GlobeandBAFTA Award for Best Director. Boyle received two more Academy Award nominations for writing and producing the survival drama127 Hours.
In 2012, Boyle was the artistic director for the2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. He was subsequently offered a knighthood as part of theNew Year Honoursbut declined due to hisrepublicanbeliefs.
Danny Francis Boyle was born on 20 October 1956,[1]inRadcliffe,Lancashire,England, about 6 miles (9.7 km) north ofManchester's city centre, to Irish parents Frank and Annie Boyle, both fromCounty Galway. He has a twin sister, Marie, and a younger sister, Bernadette, both of whom are teachers.[2][3]
Although he now describes himself as a "spiritual atheist",[4]he was brought up in a working-class Catholic family. Boyle was analtar boyfor eight years and his mother had the priesthood in mind for him, but at the age of 14 he was persuaded by a priest not to transfer to aseminary.[5]
Whether he was saving me from the priesthood or the priesthood from me, I don't know. But quite soon after, I started doing drama. And there's a real connection, I think. All these directors –Martin Scorsese,John Woo,M. Night Shyamalan– they were all meant to be priests. There's something very theatrical about it. It's basically the same job – poncing around, telling people what to think.[6][7]
Boyle attendedThornleigh Salesian College, a Catholic boys'direct grant grammar schoolinBolton,[8]and studied English and drama at the University College of North Wales (nowBangor University), where he directed several productions for the student drama society.[2][9]
Upon graduating from university he began his career at theJoint Stock Theatre Companybefore moving on to theRoyal Court Theatrein 1982 where he directedThe GeniusbyHoward BrentonandSavedbyEdward Bond. He also directed five productions for theRoyal Shakespeare Company.[10]

Boyle was artistic director for the2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremonyin London. EntitledIsles of Wonder, it charted aspects ofBritish cultureincluding theIndustrial Revolutionand contributions to literature, music, film, and technology.[21]
Reception to the ceremony was generally positive both nationally in the United Kingdom and internationally.[22][23][24][25]

The series aired onFXandDisney+on 30 May 2022,[26]and starsEmma Appleton, Louis Partridge andMaisie Williams, amongst others. The show was filmed in London.[27]
Boyle's love for film began with his first viewing ofApocalypse Now:
It had eviscerated my brain, completely. I was an impressionable twenty-one-year-old guy from the sticks. My brain had not been fed and watered with great culture, you know, as art is meant to do. It had been sandblasted by the power of cinema. And that's why cinema, despite everything we try to do, it remains a young man's medium, really, in terms of audience.[28]
The first film Boyle directed wasShallow Grave.[10]The film was the most commercially successful British film of 1995,[29]won theBAFTA Award for Best British Film, and led to the production ofTrainspotting.[30]Working with writerJohn Hodgeand producerAndrew Macdonald,Shallow Graveearned Boyle the Best Newcomer Award from the 1996 London Film Critics Circle.[29]Critics credited these films with revitalising British cinema in the early '90s.[10]TheBFIrankedTrainspottingthe10th greatest British film of the 20th century.[31]
Boyle declined an offer to direct thefourth filmof theAlienfranchise to makeA Life Less Ordinary.[32][33]

He also directed a short filmAlien Love Triangle(starringKenneth Branagh), which was intended to be one of three shorts within a feature film. However the project was cancelled after the two other shorts were made into feature films:MimicstarringMira SorvinoandImpostorstarringGary Sinise.[35]In 2004 Boyle directedMillions,[6]scripted byFrank Cottrell Boyce.[36]His next collaboration with Alex Garland[6]was the 2007 science-fiction filmSunshine, featuring28 Days LaterstarCillian Murphy.[37]
In 2008 he directedSlumdog Millionaire, the story of an impoverished child (Dev Patel) on the streets ofMumbai, India, who competes on the localversion ofWho Wants to Be a Millionaire?, for which Boyle won Academy and BAFTA Awards for Best Director. The most successful British film of the decade, the film won eightAcademy Awardsand sevenBAFTA Awards.[38][39]Boyle commented, "To be a film-maker...you have to lead. You have to be psychotic in your desire to do something. People always like the easy route. You have to push very hard to get something unusual, something different."[10]Andrew Macdonald, producer ofTrainspotting, said "Boyle takes a subject that you've often seen portrayed realistically, in a politically correct way, whether it's junkies or slum orphans, and he has managed to make it realistic but also incredibly uplifting and joyful."[10]The success led a deal with Fox Searchlight.[40]
Despite the commercial success ofSlumdog Millionaire, Boyle also faced great criticism for his portrayal of India through a Western, idealized lens. Some critics saw the film as "poverty porn," though Boyle argued he showed India's "lust for life" and "resilience."[41]
In 2010, Boyle directed the film127 Hours, starringJames Francoand featuringAmber TamblynandKate Mara. It was based on Aron Ralston's autobiographyBetween a Rock and a Hard Place, which detailed his struggle of being trapped under a boulder whilecanyoneeringalone inBluejohn Canyon, southeasternUtah. The film was released on 5 November 2010 to critical acclaim and got six nominations at the83rd Academy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Adapted Screenplayfor Boyle andBest Actorfor Franco.[42][43]
Boyle's next film wasTrance, starringJames McAvoyandRosario Dawson. It has been reported another instalment of the28 Days Laterfranchise is in the development stages.[44][45]Boyle has stated previously that in theory the third instalment of the series would be titled28 Months Later, but alluded to a film taking place somewhere else in the world he created in28 Days Laterand28 Weeks Later. He was also stated to be producing the upcoming filmPaani.[46]
Boyle told an interviewer about the eclectic range of his films, "There's a theme running through all of them—and I just realised this. They're all about someone facing impossible odds and overcoming them."[47]With a strong interest in music, Boyle has mentioned in interviews that he has considered amusical filmwith original compositions. Boyle has also expressed interest in an animated film.[48]
Boyle'seponymous biopicofApple Inc.founderSteve Jobsclosed the 59thBFI London Film Festival. It was the third time Boyle has had that honour, afterSlumdog Millionairein 2008 and127 Hourstwo years later. The BFI's London Film Festival Director, Clare Stewart, said Boyle had created an exhilarating and audacious film about a complex, charismatic pioneer.[49]He then directed the sequel toTrainspotting,T2 Trainspotting.[50]
In a BBC interview, Boyle stated that he didn't write his own films but they did reflect his personality. "I am not a big auteur fan and like to work with writers, but ultimately a film is a director's vision, because he gets all its elements together towards that vision."[51]
In March 2018, Boyle confirmed he would be directing the then-untitledtwenty-fifthJames Bondfilm (later known asNo Time to Die)[52]but dropped out that August due to a dispute over the film's script.[53][54]

He is also known for the dramaWar Horse(2011) and for having co-written the sitcomsBlackadder,Mr. Bean, andThe Vicar of Dibley. His early career saw him write material for the BBC'sNot the Nine O'Clock Newsand ITV'sSpitting Image.
In 2007, Curtis received theBAFTA Fellowshipfor lifetime achievement from theBritish Academy of Film and Television Arts.[1]He is the co-founder, withSir Lenny Henry, of the British charityComic Relief, which has raised over £1 billion.[2]At the 2008Britannia Awards, he received the BAFTA Humanitarian Award for co-creating Comic Relief and for his contributions to other charitable causes.[3]In 2024, he received theJean Hersholt Humanitarian Awardfrom theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[4]
Curtis was listed inThe Observeras one of the 50 funniest figures in British comedy in 2003.[5]In 2008, he was ranked number 12 in a list of the "100 most powerful people in British culture" compiled byThe Telegraph.[6]In 2012, he was one of the British cultural icons selected by artistSir Peter Blaketo appear in a new version of his most famous artwork—the cover ofThe Beatles' 1967 albumSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.[7]
Curtis was born inWellington, New Zealand. He is the son of Glyness S. and Anthony J. Curtis.[8]His father was aCzechoslovakrefugee who moved to Australia when aged 13[9]and became an executive atUnilever. Curtis and his family lived in several different countries during his childhood, including Sweden and the Philippines, before moving to the United Kingdom when he was 11.[10]
Curtis attendedPapplewick SchoolinAscot, Berkshire(as did his younger brother Jamie). For a short period in the 1970s, he lived inWarrington,Cheshire, where he attended Appleton Grammar School (nowBridgewater High School). He lived at Merricourt on Windmill Lane,Appleton, Warrington, during this time. His university friendRowan Atkinsonwas an occasional visitor to the house.[11]
He then won a scholarship toHarrow School, where he joined the editorial team ofThe Harrovian, the weekly school magazine, and this, he asserts, is "where I learned all the skills that made me a sketch writer. I did reviews, comment pieces and funny articles where I'd try to conjure something out of nothing."[12]While at Harrow, Curtis directed a school performance ofJoe Orton's playThe Erpingham Camp; this controversial choice was given the 'green light' by his classics master,James Morwood. Later, Curtis commented that Morwood's support had helped him understand that it was all right "to push boundaries and to be funny".[12]Curtis did not approve offaggingat the school, and at 18, when he became head of his house, he banned it.[12]
He achieved a first-class Bachelor of Arts in English Language and Literature atChrist Church, Oxford. At theUniversity of Oxford, he met and began working withRowan Atkinson, after they both joined the scriptwriting team of the Etceteras revue, part of theExperimental Theatre Club. He appeared in the company's "After Eights" at theOxford Playhousein May 1976.
Collaborating withRowan AtkinsoninThe Oxford Revue, he appeared alongside him at his breakthroughEdinburgh Fringeshow. As a result, he was commissioned to co-write the BBC Radio 3 seriesThe Atkinson Peoplewith Atkinson in 1978, which was broadcast in 1979.[13]He then began to write comedy for film and TV. He was a regular writer on the BBC comedy seriesNot the Nine O'Clock News, where he wrote many of the show's satirical sketches, often with Rowan Atkinson. Curtis co-wrote withPhilip PopeforThe Hee Bee Gee Bees' song "Meaningless Songs (In Very High Voices)", released in 1980, to parody the style of a series ofThe Bee Gees' disco hits. In 1984 and 1985, Curtis wrote material for ITV's satirical puppet showSpitting Image.[14]
First with Atkinson and later withBen Elton, Curtis then wrote theBlackadderseries from 1983 to 1989, each season focusing on a different era in British history. Atkinson playedthe leadthroughout, but Curtis was the only writer who participated inevery episode ofBlackadder. The pair continued their collaboration with the comedy seriesMr. Bean, which ran from 1990 to 1995.
Curtis had by then already begun writing feature films. His first wasThe Tall Guy(1989), a romantic comedy starringJeff Goldblum,Emma Thompsonand Rowan Atkinson and produced by Working Title films. The TV movieBernard and the Geniefollowed in 1991.
In 1994, Curtis created and co-wroteThe Vicar of Dibleyfor comedianDawn French, which was a great success. In an online poll conducted in 2004Britain's Best Sitcom, it was voted the third-best sitcom in British history andBlackadderthe second-best, making Curtis the only screenwriter to create two shows in the poll's top 10 programmes.[citation needed]
Curtis achieved his breakthrough success with the romantic comedyFour Weddings and a Funeral.The 1994 film, starringHugh GrantandAndie MacDowell, was produced on a limited budget by the British production companyWorking Title Films. Curtis choseMike Newellto direct the film after watching his TV filmReady When You Are, Mr. McGill.[15]Four Weddings and a Funeralproved to be the top-grossing British film in history at that time. It made an international star of Grant, and Curtis' Oscar nomination for the script catapulted him to prominence (though the Oscar went toQuentin TarantinoandRoger AvaryforPulp Fiction). The film was also nominated for Best Picture, but lost toForrest Gump.
Curtis' next film was also for Working Title, which has remained his artistic home ever since. 1997'sBeanbrought Mr. Bean to the big screen and was a huge hit around the world. He continued his association with Working Title writing the 1999 romantic comedyNotting Hill,starringHugh GrantandJulia Roberts, which broke the record set byFour Weddings and a Funeralto become the top-grossing British film. The story of a lonely travel bookstore owner who falls in love with the world's most famous movie star was directed byRoger Michell.
Curtis next co-wrote the screen adaptation of the international bestsellerBridget Jones's Diaryfor Working Title. Curtis knew the novel's writerHelen Fielding. Indeed, he has credited her with saying that his original script forFour Weddings and a Funeralwas too upbeat and needed the addition of the titular funeral.
Two years later, Curtis re-teamed with Working Title to write and directLove Actually. Curtis has said in interviews that the sprawling, multi-character structure ofLove Actuallyowes a debt to his favourite film,Robert Altman'sNashville. The film featured a "Who's Who" of UK actors, includingHugh Grant,Colin Firth,Bill Nighy,Emma Thompson,Liam Neeson,Andrew Lincoln,Alan RickmanandKeira Knightley, in a loosely connected series of stories about people in and out of love in London in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Its regular festive screening has seen it labelled as being arguably a modern-day Christmas staple.[16][17]
Curtis followed this in 2004 with work as co-writer onBridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, the sequel toBridget Jones's Diary. Curtis then wrote the screenplay toThe Girl in the Café, a television film directed byDavid Yatesand produced by theBBCandHBOas part of theMake Poverty Historycampaign'sLive 8efforts in 2005. The film starsBill Nighyas a civil servant andKelly Macdonaldas a young woman he falls in love with at a fictionalG8 summitin Iceland. Macdonald's character pushes him to ask whether the developed countries of the world cannot do more to help the most impoverished. The film was timed to air just before theGleneagles G8 summitin 2005. It received threeEmmy Awardsin 2006, includingOutstanding Made for Television Movie,Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a MovieforKelly Macdonaldand aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Specialtrophy for Curtis himself. Curtis said of Yates' direction that he made "a much more beautiful film, and a surprising film and a better film than I could possibly have made."[15]
"The difference between having a good idea for a movie and a finished movie is the same as seeing a pretty girl across the floor at a party and being there when she gives birth to your third child... It's a very long journey."
In May 2007, he received theBAFTAFellowship at theBritish Academy Television Awardsin recognition of his successful career in film and television and his charity efforts.[19][20]Curtis next co-wrote withAnthony Minghellaan adaptation ofAlexander McCall Smith's novel,The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, which Minghella shot in mid-2007 in Botswana. It premiered on the BBC on 23 March 2008, just days after Minghella's death. The film did not run in the US until early 2009, when HBO aired it as the pilot of a resulting six-episode TV series with the same cast, on which Curtis served as executive producer.
His second film as writer/director,The Boat That Rocked, was released in 2009. The film was set in 1966 in the era ofBritish pirate radio. It followed a group of DJs on apirate radio stationrun from a boat in theNorth Sea. The film starredPhilip Seymour Hoffman,Bill Nighy,Nick Frost,Rhys Ifans,Gemma ArtertonandKenneth Branagh. The film was a commercial and critical disappointment in the UK. Curtis re-edited the film for its US release where it was re-titledPirate Radio, but also failed to find an audience. He followed that withWar Horse, which he rewrote for directorSteven Spielbergbased on an earlier script by playwrightLee Hall. Curtis was recommended to Spielberg byDreamWorks StudioexecutiveStacey Snider, who had worked with Curtis during her time atUniversal Studios. Curtis's work on the World War I-setBlackadder Goes Forthmeant he was already familiar with the period.[21]
Curtis then wroteMary and Martha, a BBC/HBO television film directed by Phillip Noyce. The film starredHilary SwankandBrenda Blethynas two women who bond after they both lose their sons to malaria. The film was broadcast in the UK on 1 March 2013.

Soon after the film came out, Curtis delivered a screenwriting lecture as part of the BAFTA and BFI Screenwriters' Lecture Series.[24]He followed that withTrash, which he adapted from thenovelby Andy Mulligan for directorStephen Daldry.[25]With three unknown Brazilian children in the lead roles, the film co-starredWagner Moura,Rooney MaraandMartin Sheen. It was filmed in 2013 in Rio de Janeiro and released in Brazil on 9 October 2014 and in the UK on 30 January 2015.

While Barth's original screenplay depicted an obscure musician unable to capitalize on his windfall, Curtis's more conventional script featured an independent musician unable to control his own career once the music industry takes over.[28]It began filming on 21 April 2018 and was released on 28 June 2019.[30]
Curtis together withLenny Henryare co-founders and co-creators ofComic Relief. Curtis is also a founder ofMake Poverty History.

Curtis helped spearhead the launch of theRobin Hood taxcampaign in 2010. The campaign fights for a 0.05% tax levied on each bank trade ranging from shares to foreign exchange and derivatives that could generate $700bn worldwide and be spent on measures to combat domestic and international poverty as well as fightclimate change.[32]
In October 2010, a short film created by Curtis titledNo Pressurewas released by the10:10 campaignin Britain to promoteclimate change politics. The film depicted a series of scenes in which people were asked if they were going to participate in the 10:10 campaign, told there was "no pressure" to do so, but if they did not, they were blown up at the press of a red button.
Reaction was mixed, but the video was swiftly removed from the organisation's website.[33]
In March 2011, Curtis apologised following a complaint by theBritish Stammering Associationabout 2011Comic Relief's opening skit, a parody byLenny Henryof the 2010 filmThe King's Speech.[34]

What kind of world is it building?"[40]
In 2021, he joined theRewriting Extinctioncampaign to fight the climate and biodiversity crisis through comics. He wrote a comic story in collaboration withWar and Peasnamed "Woke".
