He and his younger brother Patrick were raised inFarmvilleandChesterfield County, where they attended J.P. Wynne Campus School, thelaboratory schoolrun byLongwood Collegewhere their mother also taught; Gilligan would later use the J.P. Wynne name for the fictional high school whereWalter Whiteteaches inBreaking Bad.[1][4][5]
Growing up, Gilligan became best friends with future film editor and film title designerAngus Wall. His interest in film began when Wall's mother Jackie, who also taught alongside Gilligan's mother at J.P. Wynne, would lend herSuper 8 film camerasto him. He used the camera to makescience fictionfilms with Patrick.[6]One of his first films was entitledSpace Wreck, starring Patrick in the lead role. One year later, he won first prize for his age group in a film competition at theUniversity of Virginia.[1]Jackie would take Wall and Gilligan to Richmond and drop them off at Cloverleaf Mall to see films, encouraging both of them to pursue a career in the arts. Gilligan later said, "I wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for Jackie. She was a wonderful lady and a real inspiration."[6]

"Television is historically good at keeping its characters in a self-imposed stasis so that shows can go on for years or even decades", he said.
