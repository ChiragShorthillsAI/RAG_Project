Motherless Brooklynis a 2019 Americanneo-noircrime filmwritten, produced, and directed byEdward Norton, based on the1999 novel of the same namebyJonathan Lethem. Set in 1957 New York City, the film stars Norton as aprivate investigatorwithTourette syndrome, who is determined to solve the murder of his mentor.Motherless Brooklynalso starsBruce Willis,Gugu Mbatha-Raw,Bobby Cannavale,Cherry Jones,Alec Baldwin,Ethan SupleeandWillem Dafoe.
A passion project of Norton's ever since he had read Lethem's novel in 1999, the filmtook nearly twenty years to go into production. Although the book is set in contemporary times, Norton felt the plot and dialogue lent themselves more to anoirsetting—moving it to the 1950s, with many added plot points inspired byThe Power Broker. Other members of the cast joined by February 2018, andprincipal photographybegan that same month.
Motherless Brooklynpremiered at the46th Telluride Film Festivalon August 30, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 1, 2019, byWarner Bros. Pictures. It underperformed at the box office, grossing $18.6 million against a $26 million budget. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its ideas and Norton's performance, but criticism for its length and deviations from its source novel. At the77th Golden Globe Awards,Motherless Brooklynreceived a nomination forBest Original Score.
Motherless Brooklynis also Bruce Willis' final theatrically released performance (aside from a limited theatrical release forMidnight in the Switchgrass), as he shifted over to adirect-to-videomarket for the remainder of his career before retiring in 2022.
In 1950s New York City, Lionel Essrog works at a detective agency alongside Gilbert Coney, Danny Fantl, and Tony Vermonte. Their boss, Frank Minna, rescued them as children from an abusive orphanage. Nicknamed "Motherless Brooklyn" by Frank, Lionel hasTourette syndromeandOCD, often alienating him from people, but his strongverbalandphotographicmemorymake him a good detective.
Working a secret case, Frank asks Lionel and Gilbert to shadow him to a meeting. Lionel listens over the phone as Frank presents documents that threaten a business deal for a man named William Lieberman, who's there with his assistant Lou and an extremely large henchman. When Frank tries to negotiate a high price, the men force him to take them to the originals. Lionel and Gilbert follow in their car, arriving just as Frank is shot. They take him to the hospital, but Frank dies.
Frank's widow Julia leaves Tony in charge of the office. Lionel begins wearing Frank's hat and coat, and a matchbook in Frank's pocket leads Lionel to an African-American owned jazz bar inHarlem. He realizes that Frank's findings involve Laura Rose, who works for Gabby Horowitz fightingurban renewal; poor and minority neighborhoods are being bought out and demolished, forcing out their residents. Lionel goes to a public meeting where Moses Randolph, a commissioner of several development authorities, is loudly contested by Horowitz and the audience. Stealing a reporter's credentials, Lionel talks to a man named Paul who raged against Moses at the meeting and tells him Moses is the real power in the city government, even beyond the mayor.
Under the guise of reporting on the urban renewal story, Lionel gets to know Laura. She takes him to a club Frank was investigating, where her father Billy –  assuming Lionel is one of Moses' men –  has him beaten unconscious. Lionel is rescued by a trumpet player, and discovers that Paul is Moses' brother and an engineer. He realizes Lieberman is receivingkickbackson many of the housing deals, and that the housing relocation programs are scams. Paul presents Moses with a huge renovation plan to improve the city.
Billy calls Lionel, apologizing for the attack and offering to meet with information. However, Lionel arrives to find Billy murdered –  with his death staged as a suicide. Staying the night with a distraught Laura at her house, Lionel admits his true identity and that he believes she is in danger. Finding photos of Paul meeting with Billy on his own, Lionel confronts Laura, who explains that her "Uncle" Paul is her real father. Paul denies this to Lionel, and explains that Frank and Billy planned to get more money out of Randolph's goons, against Paul's protests. He begs Lionel to find the evidence.
Lionel is brought to Moses, who invites him to join his team and stop snooping, with 24 hours to decide. Inside Frank's hat, Lionel finds the key to aPennsylvania Stationstorage locker, containing a property deed and Laura's birth certificate, which reveals Moses is her father. Lionel gives the key to Paul and runs into Tony, who has been working surveillance for Randolph. Tony admits he has been sleeping with Julia, and tells Lionel to take Moses’ deal since Laura will soon be killed. Lionel races to save Laura, stopping her before she enters her apartment, and they flee. Laura knocks the large henchman off the fire escape, and Lou corners them with a gun but is hit in the head with a trumpet by the trumpet player, who drives Laura out of town.
Lionel meets Moses, who reveals that he raped Laura's mother, a hotel employee. Paul forged Moses' signature on the birth certificate and exposure of this secret threatened Moses. Lionel warns Moses to leave Laura alone or he will release the information. He informs Moses that Lieberman is on the take and asks that when Moses has Lieberman killed, to tell him it is for Frank. Moses tells Lionel to tell Paul that his plans for the city will proceed.
The next day Paul learns that Moses denied his plans out of spite while Lionel mails the information about Lieberman to the reporter whose credentials he stole. Lionel drives to the seaside property Frank left to him where Laura is waiting for him.
Norton took significant creative license with Lethem's book,[4]keeping only the character of Lionel Essrog, his mentor Frank Minna, and the idea of him investigating his surrogate father's murder;[5]deviationsThe Atlantic's David Sims considers "both radical and baffling".[6]
Although the novel takes place in a modern 1999 setting, Norton rewrote the story for the 1950s, because the "characters are written in a very 1950s hardboiled detective style ... and if we try to make a film about the '90s in Brooklyn with guys acting like '50s gumshoes, it will feel ironic."[2]While Lethem created a conspiracy revolving around mobsters, Buddhist monks, and Frank Minna's brother, Norton instead creates an entirely new conspiracy involving New York's (fictional) Borough Authority and the illegitimate mixed-race offspring of a powerful city official.[7]Norton added characters such as Moses Randolph to the story, who is based on the New York City urban planner,Robert Moses[8][9]while dropping others, such as Frank Minna's brother Gerard.[5]For other characters, Norton drew inspiration fromHortense GabelandJane Jacobswho were prominent critics of housing discrimination in New York during the 50s and 60s,[10]and he replaced the book's love interest Kimmerly with Laura, the unknowing daughter of Moses Randolph.[5]Lethem spends considerable time in the book depicting Lionel's childhood at the St. Vincent's Home for Boys orphanage, something the movie only briefly references.[5]While the book ends with Lionel going back to the detective agency turned car service, with his love interest leaving him, and most of his friends dead or missing, the movie ends with Lionel together with Laura considering a life outside Brooklyn.[5]
Edward Nortonis the grandson ofJames Rouse, an urban planner who argued that housing should be affordable to all and that communities should be shaped by humanistic impulses rather than purely economic ones. Norton describes him as an anti-Robert Moses.[11]Notably, James Rouse foundedColumbia, Maryland, as a diverse, community-minded city,[12]where Edward Norton grew up. In 1982, Rouse also started the Enterprise Foundation (now calledEnterprise Community Partners), a nonprofit devoted to establishing international low-income housing. It estimates that it has created 585,000 affordable homes over the last four decades.[12]Upon graduating fromYale Universityin 1991 with a history degree, Norton moved to Japan where his first job was to work for his grandfather's foundation.[13]
About the link between this film and James Rouse, Norton said, "I did it as an homage to the things he cared about, and I think he would be very gratified."[12]
After making the 1998 filmAmerican History X,Edward Nortonacquired the rights to adaptJonathan Lethem's novelMotherless Brooklyn.[2]In October 1999, it was announced that Norton would star in and produce the film.[14]In 2012, Norton finished writing the script.[15]
Norton was uncertain as to whether he would direct the film.[16]He imagined shopping the film to directors such asBennett Miller,Paul Thomas Anderson, andDavid Fincher.[17]Toby Emmerichencouraged Norton to direct the film himself.[17]In February 2014, the project was set, with Norton directing.[18]Norton said that he was motivated to continue being involved in the film due to theelectionofDonald Trumpas President of the United States.[19]
Production commenced in February 2018 in New York City, with Norton,Willem Dafoe,Bruce Willis,Gugu Mbatha-Raw, andAlec Baldwin, among others, set to star.[20][21]Bobby CannavaleandDallas Robertsjoined the cast a few weeks later.[22]Michael K. Williamswas cast as a jazz musician. Norton has creditedThe Wirewith giving him a long-standing desire to work with Williams and also called it "a great dissection of the complexity of American urban life".[10][23]He also mentionedChinatown, and how it represented a reaction to the politics of the 70's, as a direct source of inspiration for him.[19]
Additional filming took place in December 2018 inTroy, New York.[24]It took 46 days to shoot the entire film.[25]The film was shot byDick Popeand edited byJoe Klotz.[26]Visual effects were used for the scene inPennsylvania Station, which was demolished in 1963.[27]
On March 22, 2018, a fire broke out in the cellar of theHarlembuilding where production was taking place, beneath the film's set.[28]The resulting blaze killedFDNYFirefighter (posthumously promoted to Lieutenant) Michael R. Davidson of Engine 69.[29]Production was temporarily suspended the next day, and was resumed a week later.[30][31]Several lawsuits were filed in the aftermath of the blaze, among others,[32][33]by Michael R. Davidson's widow against Norton's production company Class 5 Films for the wrongful death of her husband,[34]and by Class 5 Films against the building's landlord.[35]
Norton emailedRadioheadsingerThom Yorkeasking him to write a song for the film.[36]Two weeks later, Yorke emailed him a song, "Daily Battles".[36]Yorke'sAtoms for PeacebandmateFleacontributed bass and horns.[36]Norton enlisted jazz musicianWynton Marsalisto rearrange the song as a ballad reminiscent of 1950sMiles Davis,[36]with pianistIsaiah J. Thompson, bassist Russell Hall, saxophonistJerry Weldonand drummerJoe Farnsworth.[37]Both versions were used in the film,[38]and were released on streaming services on August 21, 2019, and as a vinyl single on October 4, 2019.[39]
ComposerDaniel Pembertonwrote the score forMotherless Brooklynin less than four weeks and produced it in less than two weeks.[40]He recorded it atAbbey Road Studiosin three days.[41]Norton told him, "I want like half Miles Davis half Radiohead. I want a big, lyrical, thematic jazz score but I also want this element of dissonance because of the character’s brain."[40]
Motherless Brooklynhad its world premiere at the46th Telluride Film Festivalon August 30, 2019.[42]It also screened at the2019 Toronto International Film Festival,[43]the 2019Vancouver International Film Festival,[44]the2019 New York Film Festival,[45]the 2019Mill Valley Film Festival,[46]the 2019Chicago International Film Festival,[47]the 2019Rome Film Festival,[48]the 2019San Diego International Film Festival,[49]and the 2019Haifa International Film Festival.[50]It was released in the United States on November 1, 2019.[51]
Motherless Brooklyngrossed $9.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $9.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $18.6 million, against a production budget of $26 million.[3]Some publications listed it among thebox office bombsof 2019.[4]
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongsideTerminator: Dark Fate,Harriet, andArctic Dogs, and was projected to gross $5–9 million in its opening weekend.[52]It made $1.1 million on its first day and went on to underperform, making $3.5 million over the weekend and finishing ninth.[53]
On review aggregation websiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 64% based on 218 reviews with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Motherless Brooklyn's imposing length requires patience, but strong performances and a unique perspective make this a mystery worth investigating."[54]Metacriticassigned the film a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[55]Audiences polled byPostTrakgave the film an overall positive score of 76% (including an average 3.5 out of 5 stars), while 46% said they would definitely recommend it.[53]
Peter BradshawofThe Guardiangave the film three out of five stars, writing, "It's a heavy meal to digest, but this is a strong, vehement film with a real sense of time and place."[56]A. O. ScottofThe New York Timescalled it "a very smart movie, bristling with ideas about history, politics, art and urban planning."[57]Matt Zoller SeitzofRogerEbert.comgave the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising "the unabashedly political nature of the project."[58]
Eric Kohn ofIndieWiregave the film a grade of B−, commenting that the film "at least does justice to its source material by transforming the plight of urban development into an immersiveshaggy dog story."[59]Peter TraversofRolling Stonegave the film four out of five stars, writing, "it's Norton's own performance that brings emotional connection toMotherless Brooklyn."[60]Peter Debruge ofVarietycommented that "Lionel represents both an enormous new challenge and an incredibly unique variation on the otherwise worn-out private eye archetype."[61]
Chris Tilly ofIGNgave the film a 6.6 out of 10, writing, "The film has much to say about discrimination and inequality, but while the central detective story is intriguing, the movie all-too-often gets sidetracked down narrativecul de sacs, giving the 144-minute film serious pacing issues, and making it a frequently frustrating watch."[62]Jake Cole ofSlant Magazinegave the film one and a half out of four stars, writing, "Motherless Brooklynfeels altogether too tidy, a film that revives many of the touchstones of noir, but never that throbbing unease that courses through the classics of the genre."[63]Todd McCarthyofThe Hollywood Reportercalled the film "stylishly made, politically driven, musically arresting, narratively confusing and, at nearly two-and-a-half hours, far too long."[64]

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]
Warner Bros. owns some shared universes. Some of them are based on books and comics, including some of the highest grossing IP's in the movie industry.

You just frame them, give them circumstances, and that character will happen."[24]Principal photography for the film took place in thePhilippinesand required Dafoe to undergoboot camp training.[25]Los Angeles TimeswriterSheila Bensonpraised his performance and found it to be "particularly fine" to see Dafoe play "something other than a psychopath".[26]At the59th Academy Awards, Dafoe was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[27]Dafoe provided his voice to the documentaryDear America: Letters Home from Vietnam(1987) and, in 1988, Dafoe starred in another film set during the Vietnam War, this time as Buck McGriff in the action thrillerOff Limits.[28][29]His second release of 1988 wasMartin Scorsese's epic dramaThe Last Temptation of Christ, in which Dafoe portrayed Jesus.

The film was met with a mixed reception from critics, althoughCaryn JamesofThe New York Timesfelt that Dafoe's "stunningly sharp, sympathetic portrait raises the film above a script that is full of serious holes and stilted dialogue".[49]In 1995, he played an 18th-century writer in the period dramaThe Night and the Moment.[50]
In his first of three film appearances in 1996, Dafoe made a cameo appearance as an electrician in the biographical dramaBasquiat.[51]Next, he played an operative in the romantic war dramaThe English Patient.The English Patientwas filmed inTuscany, where Dafoe said he particularly enjoyed the "quiet moments in the monastery between shoots".[52]In the period dramaVictory—which was filmed in 1994 and premiered in Europe in 1996, but was not released until 1998—Dafoe played a European living on an island in the Southeast Asia who becomes the target of redemption after preventing a woman, played byIrène Jacob, from being raped.[53]
"I really made a conscious effort to mix it up, not because in itself it's not the job of an actor to do all different things, but for me that's what I'm interested in. You've got to be careful because you've got to work with what you have, not just for vanity's sake, but I think the best part of being an actor sometimes is the opportunity to transform yourself superficially, and deeply."
In 1997, Dafoe returned to playing a villainous role in the action thrillerSpeed 2: Cruise Control, expressing the necessity of appearing in both independent andblockbusterfilms.[55]The film starredSandra BullockandJason Patricas a couple vacationing on a luxury cruise that has been hijacked by Dafoe's character, Geiger, a hacker that has programmed the ship to crash into an oil tanker.Speed 2was met with negative reviews from critics,[56]with Dafoe himself receiving aRazzie Awardnomination forWorst Supporting Actor.[57]For his next film,Affliction(1997), Dafoe worked with Paul Schrader for a second time, playing the brother ofNick Nolte's character and served as the film's narrator.[58]Also in 1997, Dafoe took on a voice acting role in an episode of the animated sitcomThe Simpsonstitled "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", voicing the commandant of a military academy thatBartandLisa Simpsonare attending.[59]Following a villainous supporting role in the romantic mystery dramaLulu on the Bridge,[60]Dafoe starred alongsideChristopher WalkenandAsia ArgentoinAbel Ferrara'scyberpunkdramaNew Rose Hotelin 1998. It follows X (Dafoe) and Fox (Walken), a pair of corporate raiders attempting to lure a Japanese scientist from one megacorporation to another. Although the film was largely dismissed by critics,[61]criticDavid Strattonfound there to be "compensation" in the performances.[62]
