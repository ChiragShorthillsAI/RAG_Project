They convince Sue Ann "Ma" Ellington, aveterinary technician, to help them buyalcoholbecause they are not legally old enough to purchase it themselves. Sue Ann anonymously reports their activities, but they are released because of the officer's history with Andy's father, Ben. The next day Sue Ann invites the teenagers to drink in her basement. Over time, many other teenagers arrive at her house to party, making her popular among the students.
However, the group grows annoyed as Sue Ann continuously harasses them to spend time with her. One night she drugs Maggie and takes her earrings. The next morning Maggie finds cuts and bruises on her body and her earrings missing. A scared Maggie tells Andy she no longer wants to go to Sue Ann's house and that she does not want him to go either. To earn the group's trust back, Sue Ann lies that she haspancreatic cancer. Haley notices Sue Ann wearing a bracelet belonging to a friend. The girls suspect that Sue Ann has been stealing their jewelry and break into her house to investigate. They are surprised by Genie, Sue Ann's daughter from a failed marriage; Maggie is surprised to see her walking, as she uses a wheelchair at school. Maggie and Haley escape as Sue Ann comes home.
Ben, who went to high school with Sue Ann, shows up at her job to drop off his cat and invites her out for drinks after work. At the bar, Ben confronts Sue Ann with a tracking device and asks her why his son has been at her house. Ben warns Sue Ann to stay away from Andy. A flashback reveals that Sue Ann, who had a crush on Ben, was deceived into performing oral sex on a boy she thought was Ben. Ben had gotten the school to witness the assault, including his current girlfriend Mercedes and a young Erica. Sue Ann never recovered from the trauma and humiliation.
Sue Ann runs over Mercedes with her truck, killing her. She kills her boss, draws blood from Maggie's dog Louie, and lures Ben to her house, where she knocks him out. Ben wakes up naked and tied to the bed with a towel over his groin. Sue Ann then lifts up the towel grabbing onto Ben's exposedgenitaliawith one hand while holding a large knife with the other threatening tocut it off, but then changes her mind covering it back up with the towel. Sue Ann compares Ben to a dog. ShetransfusesLouie's blood into Ben, slashes his wrist, and leaves him to bleed out and die. Maggie tells her mother the truth about Sue Ann, and Erica briefly confronts Sue Ann. Sue Ann lures Maggie with a picture of herself with Andy in her basement at Chaz's birthday party. When she arrives, only the original group remains. She tries to get Andy to leave but realizes everyone has been drugged. As Maggie tries to get help, she finds Ben's body, and is drugged by Sue Ann.[5][6]
Maggie awakens chained in the basement. Sue Ann irons Chaz's stomach, sews Haley's mouth shut, and paints Darrell's face white. Andy awakens, and tries to seduce Sue Ann. After kissing, she stabs him for lying. A police officer arrives and is shot by Sue Ann after Maggie screams for help. Sue Ann forces Maggie to gather her friends and take pictures. Sue Ann attempts to hang Maggie but Genie intervenes, starting a fire in the process. Everyone else wakes up and attempts to get out as the fire spreads. Erica, knowing where Maggie likely is, goes with her co-worker to save the teens. Sue Ann attempts to throw Genie into the fire and blames Erica for not stopping the sexual assault. Erica articulates her regrets and Maggie stabs Sue Ann, saving Genie.
The group runs outside as Sue Ann walks upstairs and lies down with Ben's corpse as the house burns.
Macame together as a result ofTate Taylor's desire to direct a film about "something fucked up", and a conversation he had withOctavia Spencerin which she told him that she was "sick of only being offered the same role and never getting to be a lead."[7]The two are longtime friends, having worked together in films such asThe HelpandGet On Up.[7]Jason Blumand Taylor, who have been friends for a few years, knew each other socially.[8]
Taylor went to Blum's office, reiterating, "I want to do something really fucked up."[8]He read Scotty Landes' script of the film, whichBlumhouse Productionshad bought the day before.[8]Taylor immediately thought about Spencer.[7]He went out to the hall, called Spencer, and asked her if she would like to be in a horror film;[8]without reading the script, Spencer boarded the project.[8]
There was no backstory for the title character in the original script, which made her "a complete monster that no audience member could sympathize with".[7]The filmmakers made it a priority to come up with an authentic backstory for the role.[7]Taylor thought it was important to weave the themes of trauma, the sins of our parents, and how we treat people into the story to create a character audiences can relate to and feel bad for.[7]

Lewis played Amanda, a troubled teenager who falls into a world of prostitution and drugs.[18]In his review for theLos Angeles Times, Ray Loynd felt that the film worked due to its "compelling script [and Lewis'] authentic portrayal of the young and abused murderess whose first question to her public defender [is] whether he has any sugar-coated candies".[19]
Lewis garnered international attention when she beat out 500 other actresses to play Danielle Bowden,[20]the daughter of a family targeted by psychopathic criminalMax Cady, inMartin Scorsese's1991 remakeofCape Fear(1962).[21]Vincent CanbyofThe New York Timeslauded her performance, calling her "a new young actress of stunning possibilities",[21]whileThe Hollywood Reporter's Duane Byrge commented, "Perhaps providing the strongest real counterbalance toDe Niro's crazy Cady is Juliette Lewis, whose [performance] shows the most sinewy fiber".[22]She went on to receiveGolden GlobeandAcademy Awardnominations for the role.[23][24]Retrospectively, the sequence in which her character is seduced by Cady was named one of the most unforgettable scenes in film history byEntertainment WeeklyandComplex.[25][26]On working with Scorsese, Lewis has since said, "I liken that period of time to being anointed, or getting my creative wings ... [the experience] changed me [and] gave me a confidence ... It wasn't [about] the outside accolades. It was [Scorsese] nurturing my ingredients as a performer".[27]

Mickey and Mallory are a Bonnie and Clyde for the '90s, Stone's '90s; they're damaged goods — haunted, horny and out for blood.Harrelsonand Lewis ... play the dysfunctional hell out of them ... Women don't [usually] dominate Stone films [but] Lewis towers overKillers, finding the wildcat and the bruised child in Mallory.[39]

Her portrayal of Kelly in the latter was particularly well received,[89]withThe New York Timescommenting that it "crackle[s] with authenticity", adding:
The distance between riot grrrl and suburban mom is quite a stretch. But as middle age approaches, time has a way of landing mouthy young rebels in roles they never expected to inhabit. Take Juliette Lewis, the personification of scary defiance [in]Natural Born Killers... InKelly & Cal, [she] conveys the excruciating discomfort of a slightly crumpled former upstart struggling to adapt to a staid, middle-class existence. That means reining in the anarchic impulses of her youth and tolerating polite, buttoned-up in-laws.[90]
Lewis' next role was inJem and the Holograms(2015), an adaptation of the 1980s animated seriesJem,[91]where she played a music producer. The film was a financial disappointment forUniversaland received a largely negative response from critics.[91][92]She followed this with a starring role as a small-town detective on the ABC crime drama seriesSecrets and Lies, which ran for two seasons.

Natalie is nothing like myself. But because there's certain things, like 'tough' and 'wrong side of the tracks' or whatever, people think it's something I've played before, but I haven't. [It has taken] me like 30 years for people to go, 'Wow, she does unpredictable stuff, and it's high quality'".[111]During that same period, Lewis appeared as Judy onPeacock's reboot ofQueer as Folk(2022) and co-starred in the biographical Hulu miniseriesWelcome to Chippendales(also 2022).Richard Roepercalled the latter "colorful and shiny but increasingly dark and twisted" in his review for theChicago Sun-Times, adding that Lewis' portrayal of forthright costume designer Denise Coughlan was "outstanding".[112]

I think there's so much confusion because people don't understand a religion where you can be another religion but you can still practice Scientology".[118]In an interview withTimein 2015, Lewis remarked about protecting her freedom of choice and religion, and being annoyed at people's misconceptions about Scientology: "Whatever people's conceptions are of me, I think it's cute. I roll with it".[119]By 2021, she began to distance herself from Scientology, tellingThe New York TimesandThe Washington Postthat she is aspiritualistand does not identify as a Scientologist.[120][121]
Lewis married professional skateboarderSteve Berrain September 1999.[122]She filed for divorce in April 2003.[123]Lewis described the divorce as "amicable",[123]later commenting, "Steve would be the first to admit he was a workaholic. You have to be ready to have a partnership. And sometimes you're like, 'Whoa, this is too much. I only actually have enough steam to focus on my own thing'".[32]
Lewis has supportedLittle Kids Rock, an American nonprofit organization that works to restore and revitalize music education in disadvantaged U.S. public schools, by painting aFender Stratocasterguitar and donating it to an auction to raise money for the organization.[124]
