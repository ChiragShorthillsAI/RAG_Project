InSeattle, an elderlyGolden Retrievernamed Enzo is too weak to move, so he waits for his owner, professional race car driver Denny Swift, to carry him outside. Denny picks him up, promising to always be there for him. Enzo recalls hearing of aMongolianbelief that the best dogs get to reincarnate into men. Enzo knows he is not long for this world, but he hopes to find Denny again in another life.
Years prior, Denny adopts a young Enzo after a sports car race. They immediately bond, with Denny naming him afterEnzo Ferrari. Denny divides his time between teaching,auto racing, and caring for Enzo. Denny dreams of racing inFormula One, and is struggling to support himself driving forIMSAteams. A year later, Denny meets Eve, they hit it off and, although Enzo disapproves, Denny invites her out and they begin dating. Their relationship grows quickly, which Enzo envies, until one day Eve confides in him her love for Denny, which he accepts. They marry the following year at her parents' mansion. Eve's mother Trish is supportive, but her father Maxwell doesn't approve.
Shortly after, Eve becomes pregnant. At Christmas, Denny is invited to drive forTeam Penskein the24 Hours of Daytonain late January, a few weeks before Eve's due date. Eve insists that he go, as she believes it could be the start of better things in his career. Eve and Denny's child comes early, and Eve gives birth at home midway through the race as Enzo watches Denny on TV. When Enzo meets the couple’s newborn daughter Zoë, Eve tells her he will always protect her. Days later, when Denny meets Zoë, he discloses his team lost in the last stint, but hopes more races will come.
Eve’s parents visit more frequently, and Maxwell confronts Denny on the dangers of racing, as he is now a father. He swears to always put his safety first, even if he loses every race he enters. A few years pass and Enzo finds family life idyllic, while Denny spends prolonged periods away racing. He then tells Eve that he was invited to race atLaguna Seca, but is hesitant as he feels his career is stagnating. Enzo, witnessing this, is shocked that Denny is considering quitting racing. Eve falls seriously ill, which Enzo detects through a change in her scent. Eve is diagnosed withbrain cancer, with she and Zoë living with her parents during her treatment. Resigned to her fate, Eve admits to Enzo that she doesn't fear death and passes away as he watches.
At Eve's funeral, Maxwell accuses Denny of putting his racing career ahead of his family and demandscustodyof Zoë, threatening to sue if Denny does not comply. Furious at his insinuation of negligence, Denny attempts to leave, but Maxwell grabs him and Denny shoves him away, causing Maxwell to fall and allegedly break a rib. Maxwell reports the incident to the police and Denny is arrested on an4th-degree assaultcharge. If he loses the case, he faces three months incarceration plus permanent loss of custody of Zoë to his in-laws. Denny continues racing and is offered a job inMaranello, testing prototypes forFerrari. He declines due to his court case, but promises he will accept if he wins.
A frustrated Denny goes jogging in the rain with Enzo. Not realizing he's falling behind, Enzo attempts to follow Denny across the street and is hit by a car. Denny rushes him to the vet, who explains he is lucky he survived, but may soon suffer fromhip dysplasia.
Financially and emotionally exhausted, Denny signs an out-of-court settlement, giving up custody of Zoë for visitation and erasing the assault charge. However, Enzo grabs the legal document and destroys it, so Denny continues to fight. At the trial, Trish admits the truth and exonerates Denny. With the charges dropped, Denny accepts the Ferrari job. When Maxwell and Trish come to Zoë's ninth birthday party, Denny is very forgiving, wanting them in Zoë's life. Over the next few weeks, Enzo's health rapidly deteriorates. Realizing that his best friend is dying, Denny takes him around the track. Lamenting he will not be able to continue on caring for his family in Italy, Enzo accepts the good life he’s had and looks forward to his new life, reincarnated as a human.
Eight years later, Denny, now a successfulFormula Onedriver forScuderia Ferrari, lives in Italy with Zoë. After a practice session, a young fan with golden hair approaches Denny for an autograph and introduces himself as Enzo. Denny smiles, says the boy reminds him of an old friend and suggests he come back when he's ready to race.
In addition, in the final scene, Lily Dodsworth-Evans has a brief appearance as a 17-year-old Zoë and formerScuderia FerrariFormula OnedriverGiancarlo Fisichellais standing in the Ferrari garage.
