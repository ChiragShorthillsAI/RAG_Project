Thomas is aBritishJewwho until a year ago used to work for Israel'sMossadintelligence agency in Germany. Now he is retired but still has access to some of his former employer's systems and resources. He receives a mysterious phone call from Rachel, another former agent whom he had recruited and who had become a friend but disappeared. Summoned to a safe house inColognein order to help find Rachel and determine her motives, Thomas reviews Rachel's recruitment and past assignments with his former supervisors through a series offlashbacks.
Rachel's last known assignment was to pose as an English teacher inTehranand observe Farhad Razavi, heir to anIranianelectronics firm.  Flashback scenes reveal Rachel's acclimatisation to routines of daily life so as not to arouse suspicion.  Eventually, she meets Farhad, who asks her to give him English lessons, leading to a romantic relationship as Farhad also introduces her to Tehran's underground nightlife.
Rachel's personal involvement with Farhad allows Thomas to involve him in the smuggling of parts for Iran's nuclear program, which will work to undermine that program and make Farhad a target for recruitment as a Mossad resource.  Some of the related assignments put her own life in serious danger.  Eventually, Rachel rebels against her assignment, changes her identity, and cuts off communication with Thomas until, returning to the film's present, she needs his help to return to a life of her own without risking assassination because she might be a security threat herself.

The Operativegrossed a total worldwide of $1.4 million.[5][6]
Although many reviewers appreciated Diane Kruger's performance and a couple of especially suspenseful scenes, critics were also disappointed in Rachel's unclear motivations, a lack of chemistry between her and Farhad, and an overly-complex plot structure.  Guy Lodge, reviewing the film at the Berlin Film Festival forVariety, remarks " . . . the general shape of the plotting is too recognizable to keep us entirely on edge, despite the stoic, furrowed-brow dedication of the cast",[14]whileThe Hollywood Reportercomplained that Kruger "needs more textured material than she's given in this choppy espionage thriller".[15]
After the film's American release, Ben Kenigsberg, inThe New York Times, described it as offering "a few suspenseful sequences, some interesting nuts-and-bolts details of espionage work and a good lead performance en route to an unsatisfying ending".[16]CriticChristy Lemiregave the film two out of four, writing that "the overall sluggish pace and prevailing feeling of ambiguity ultimately make “The Operative” an unsatisfying, frustrating experience".[17]
On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 41%, based on 32 reviews, and an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Diane Kruger delivers an appropriately steely performance, butThe Operativepursues a forgettable mission that fans of the genre will find all too familiar."[18]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 10 critics.[19]
