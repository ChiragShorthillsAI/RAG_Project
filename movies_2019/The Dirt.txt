Talks of a Mötley Crüe biopic began as early as 2006, whenParamount PicturesandMTV Filmspurchased the rights to the bookThe Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Bandby the band andNeil Strauss; however, the project then languished indevelopment hellfor over a decade, going through numerous directors and cast members beforeNetflixpurchased the rights in March 2017. Filming began aroundNew Orleansin February 2018.
The Dirtwas released digitally on Netflix on March 22, 2019. It received generally negative reviews from critics, who said the film would please fans but that it hesitated "in handling the more troubling aspects of the band's history."[2]
In 1973,Frank Carlton Feranna Jr.walks away from his mother Deana after years of abuse and moves fromSeattletoLos Angelesin 1978. After a failed attempt to connect with his biological father who abandoned the family at birth, Frank legally changes his name to "Nikki Sixx" in 1980. A year later, after a falling out with members ofLondonat theWhisky a Go Go, Nikki befriends drummerTommy Leeand reveals to him that he is forming a new band. Joining the band is guitaristMick Mars, who suffers fromankylosing spondylitis. The trio then recruit Tommy's high school friendVince Neilfrom thecover bandRockandi as lead vocalist, and after some brainstorming, the quartet name themselvesMötley Crüe.
Despite a brawl with some crowd members, Mötley Crüe's first gig at theStarwoodis well-received. They progressively sell out night clubs all over Los Angeles and rookie producer Tom Zutaut ofElektra Recordsapproaches them with a five-album deal. The band signsDoc McGheeas their manager. During their first national tour, they are given advice byOzzy Osbourneto know the limits of their partying before he snorts a line of ants and licks his and Nikki's urine on the pool floor. Before long, the band's albums go platinum and they each spend millions of dollars as fast as they earn them. Vince marries mud wrestler Sharise Ruddell, while Tommy announces his engagement to a woman named Roxie, but after his mother calls her agroupie, they get into a heated argument and Tommy punches Roxie in the face.
On December 8, 1984, during a party at Vince's home inRedondo Beach, Tommy meetsHeather Locklear, while a drunk Vince andHanoi RocksdrummerRazzledrive out to buy more drinks. They get into a car accident that kills Razzle, and has Vince sentenced to 30 days in jail for vehicular manslaughter, which is subsequently reduced to 19 days. Nikki becomes addicted toheroinand starts to display destructive behavior towards his bandmates. He fires McGhee for bringing Deana to visit him. On December 23, 1987, shortly after Tommy and Heather's wedding, Nikki overdoses on heroin and is initially declared dead, but a paramedic who is a fan of the band brings him back to life with two shots ofadrenaline. Following this, Nikki has the band go to rehab. A sober Mötley Crüe rebounds in 1989 withDr. Feelgood, which becomes their first number one album on theBillboard 200, followed by a lengthy world tour. The months of touring and staying sober take their toll on Vince and Tommy, who resort to drinking again after being away from their families for too long.
Following the tour, Vince discovers that Sharise and their daughter Skylar have left him, causing him to miss several rehearsals and eventually part ways with the band in 1992. The band then hiresJohn Corabias his replacement. In 1995, Skylar dies of stomach cancer at the age of four, while Heather divorces Tommy after he is caught having an affair with a porn star two years earlier. Mick starts to abuse painkillers as the disease is starting to overwhelm his body and movement. Seeing the backlash by fans over Vince's departure from the band, Nikki negotiates with Zutaut to give them back the rights to their songs in exchange for their release from Elektra Records. After visiting his father's grave, Nikki regroups with Tommy and Mick, who has had hip surgery, before they reconcile with Vince. Mötley Crüe would perform together for another 20 years, playing theirfinal show on New Year's Eve 2015.
The real Mötley Crüe appears in archival footage during the ending credits.
In 2006, film adaptation rights to theautobiographybookThe Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band, authored byNeil StrausswithTommy Lee,Mick Mars,Vince NeilandNikki Sixx, were bought byParamount PicturesandMTV Films. At the time,Larry Charleswas tapped to direct the film.[3]However, production on the film stalled and in 2008 Sixx spoke of his frustration in an interview stating:
"We're trying to get them out of the way to make this movie that should have been made a long time ago. MTV has become bogged down in its own way. It's a channel that used to be hip and has now actually become unhip. We signed with them because we believed they were right, but they haven't come to the table. We need to find the right partner. They are not the right partner."[4]
In November 2013,Jeff Tremainesigned on to helmThe Dirt, with the film having been dropped by MTV Films and Paramount Pictures.[5]In January 2015,Focus Featurespicked up rights to the film.[6]However, production languished indevelopment helluntil March 2017, whenNetflixbought worldwide rights to the film. At the time,Liam Hemsworth,Emory CohenandDouglas Boothwere being eyed for lead roles in the film.[7]In November 2017, Booth officially signed on to star in the film.[8]In January 2018,Machine Gun Kelly,Iwan RheonandDaniel Webberjoined the cast.[9][10]In February 2018, Tony Cavalero joined the cast.[11]In March 2018, Rebekah Graf,Leven Rambin, andDavid Costabilejoined the cast.[12][13][14]
Principal production commenced in February 2018 inNew Orleans, Louisiana.[10]
On March 11, 2018, Louis DiVincenti, a rigging grip for the production team, suffered an electric shock while de-rigging a set during the New Orleans shoot. According to DiVincenti, he was passing metal pipes to other crew members when one pipe he held made contact with a nearby power line, causing an electric current that arced through his body and blew out through his right foot. As a result, he sustained second- and third-degree burns over 50 percent of his body, which required numerous surgeries and skin grafts, and his right foot had to be amputated. On March 1, 2019, DiVincenti sued Netflix and Mötley Crüe for $1.8 million to compensate for his medical bills.[15][16][17][18]
The trailer was released on February 19, 2019 and featured glimpses of some of the stories including the infamous hotel television throwing incident,Vince Neil's vehicular manslaughter charges in 1984, andNikki Sixx's drug overdose in 1987.[19][20]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 36% based on 74 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The Dirtcelebrates the rude debauchery that Mötley Crüe's fans enjoy – but does so with the dispiriting lack of substance that the group's critics have long decried."[21]OnMetacriticthe film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "general unfavorable reviews".[22]
David Fear ofRolling Stonegave the film a rating of two out of five stars, saying that "This is rock bad-boy lore as a rocking bore, an endless parade of recreated afterparty ecstasy and emptiness that robsThe Dirtof the vicarious thrill it had on the page — the sense that you shouldn’t be having this much of a second-hand high reading about musicians acting like horrible people but still seeming living-the-dream heroic."[23]Owen GleibermanofVarietycalled the film "a thinly written, generically stagedVH1-style sketchbook of a movie — which is to say, it's a Netflix film, with zero atmosphere, overly blunt lighting, and a threadbare post-psychological telegraphed quality that gives you nothing to read between the lines."[24]Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comgave the film one out of four stars, saying that "You could listen toDr. Feelgoodtwo full times during the run time ofThe Dirtand learn just about as much about the band as you do in this R-rated Wikipedia article of a movie. And you'd have way more fun."[25]
Chris Nashawaty ofEntertainment Weeklygave the film a B, saying that "This movie won't win any awards. Nor should it. But for two hours it's a nostalgic blast to sit back and revel in the idiocy of these glorious, big-haired jackasses."[26]Rafer Guzmán ofNewsdaygave the film three out of four stars, calling it "a funny, foul-mouthed, whirlwind ride through one of the last great eras in rock history, when wretched excess was part of the job description and bad behavior was a badge of honor."[27]
The Dirt Soundtrackwas released byMötley RecordsandEleven Seven Recordson March 22, 2019, on CD, LP, and digital formats.

He went on to star in the BBC adaptations ofGreat ExpectationsandChristopher and His Kind(both 2011), Carlo Carlei's film adaptation ofRomeo & Juliet(2013), and theNetflixbiopicThe Dirt(2019).
Booth also appeared inDarren Aronofsky'sNoahandLone Scherfig'sThe Riot Club(both 2014) and co-starred inThe Wachowskis'Jupiter Ascending(2015).
Douglas John Booth was born inGreenwich, London,[2][3]to Vivien (néeDe Cala), a painter, and Simon Booth, a shipping finance consultant and former managing director of bothCitiGroupandDeutsche Bank's shipping finance divisions.[4][5]Booth's father is English, and his mother is of Spanish and Dutch ancestry.[6]His older sister, Abigail, is aChelsea School of Artgraduate.[7]Booth spent his early childhood in Greenwich and moved toSevenoaks, Kentat the age of ten.[6]
Booth is severelydyslexicand found it "very hard" to read or write up until the age of ten; he remains "a really slow reader".[8]He struggled at school, "having to put in double or triple the amount of effort as everyone else" but said the condition made him "more resilient in every sense".[9]He played the trumpet as a child.[10]Booth took his first major roles in musicals presented by the Sackville Children's Choir at the Stag Theatre in Sevenoaks. He played Leader of the Rats inRats! The Musical, and Uncle Andrew inThe Magician's Nephew. He further developed his interest in drama at the age of twelve, after starring in a school production ofAgamemnon: "I found myself feeling really engaged for the first time ... I thought, 'I rather like being the centre of attention. This is where I want to be.'"[11][12]By the age of thirteen, he was involved with theNational Youth Theatreand theGuildhall School of Music and Drama.[13][14]
Booth received both private and state education; he attended Solefield School, a boys' juniorindependent schoolin Sevenoaks, followed byBennett Memorial Diocesan School, a Church of England stateVoluntary Aided schoolin the town ofRoyal Tunbridge Wells(Kent), andLingfield Notre Dame School, anindependent schoolin the village ofLingfieldinSurrey.[citation needed]
Booth joined theCurtis Brownacting agency at the age of fifteen.[14]He won his first professional acting role at the age of sixteen and quit hisAS levelsin drama, media studies and English literature.[13]
Booth's first professional role was in the children's adventure filmFrom Time to Time(2009), directed byJulian Fellowesand starringMaggie SmithandTimothy Spall. Following the film's release, Booth signed to theUTAtalent agency for American-based representation.[15]He then had a minor role as Prince Eustace in theChannel 4miniseriesThe Pillars of the Earth(2010), a medieval saga filmed in Budapest withIan McShaneandDonald Sutherland.[13]Also in 2009 and 2010, Booth modelled in severalMario Testino-shot campaigns for the luxury fashion labelBurberry; he starred in the Autumn 2009 campaign withEmma Watson, the Autumn 2010 campaign withRosie Huntington-Whiteley, and the Burberry Sport fragrance campaign withLily Donaldson.[16]
Booth rose to prominence in 2010 following his performance as the pop starBoy Georgein theBBC TwodramaWorried About the Boy.[17]He underwent a physical transformation for the role, shaving off his eyebrows and wearing heavy makeup. Booth met Boy George during filming, with the singer remarking: "He just gets it. There's something about him that reminds me of me when I was 17."[18]Writing inThe Daily Telegraph, Ceri Radford said Booth delivered a "mesmerising" performance: "He offered a convincing portrayal of O'Dowd as a beautiful young man who oozed ambiguous sex appeal and protected his feelings with a carapace of prickly wit."[17]Mike Higgins ofThe Independentdeclared Booth "a discovery": "Moving, witty, he also got the singer's wheezy enunciation down pat."[19]
Booth next played the role ofPipin theBBC OneadaptationofDickens'Great Expectations(2011), alongsideGillian AndersonandRay Winstone. Broadcast over the Christmas period, the miniseries was a huge ratings success.[20]Anne BillsonofThe Telegraphfelt it was a misstep to cast someone "so distractingly lovely" in the role of Pip: "It's not that Douglas Booth was bad, it's just that one can't imagine Dickens ever intended Pip to be more beautiful thanEstella, who, after all, has been brought up to break men's hearts."[21]Mike Hale ofThe New York Timesdismissed Booth as "aCW-style actor whose exceptionally pretty face doesn't convey much beyond puzzlement and petulance."[22]Betsy Sharkey of theLos Angeles Times, however, found the actor's performance "haunting"[23]while Emma Jones ofThe Huffington Postdismissed the "debate over the extreme prettiness of Douglas Booth", arguing that "Booth's beauty is only a backdrop to Pip's naivety."[24]
Also in 2011, Booth appeared in the BBC filmChristopher and His Kind, which explored novelistChristopher Isherwood's formative years in 1930s Berlin. He played Heinz, a German street-sweeper who became the lover ofMatt Smith's Isherwood.[25]
In 2012, Booth starred oppositeMiley CyrusandDemi Moorein the teen dramaLOL. He witnessed the paparazzi interest surrounding co-star Cyrus during filming: "It was bizarre and, interestingly, not at all glamorous."[26]Filmed in 2010, when Booth was seventeen, the movie received a very limited theatrical release and unfavourable reviews.[27]Later that year, Booth read selected extracts fromDavid Copperfieldas part ofSky Arts'sIn Love With Dickensdocumentary; other contributors includedSimon CallowandMiriam Margolyes.[28]
In 2013, Booth starred oppositeHailee Steinfeldin Carlo Carlei'sfilm adaptationofShakespeare'sRomeo and Juliet.[29]Betsy Sharkey of theLos Angeles Timespraised Booth's memorable performance: "It's not so much that he makes a great Romeo; franklyDiCaprio's was better inLuhrmann's version, as wasLeonard WhitinginZeffirelli's… But it has been a while since a camera has so loved a face ... If anything, the movies in general are too intent on reducing Booth to that singular feature, when he is actually a fine actor."[23]R. Kurt Osenlund ofSlantfelt that Booth gives "a rather fantastic breakthrough performance, offering a poignant interpretation of one of literature's greatest lovers."[30]Mick LaSalleof theSan Francisco Chroniclebemoaned the poor casting of Steinfeld: "And this is especially a shame because Douglas Booth as Romeo is quite good and could have been better, if only he had someone to play off of."[31]Todd McCarthyofThe Hollywood Reporterremarked that Booth "seems to have a grasp of what he's saying and behaves in credibly laddish fashion ... but Booth's vocal range is very narrow, and he speaks in a monotone."[32]Claudia Puig ofUSA Todayfound Booth "more skilled" than Steinfeld "in the passionate intonation department"[33]whileThe Independent's Geoffrey MacNab asserted that Booth "shows a certain star quality."[34]
In March 2014, he appeared asSheminDarren Aronofsky's biblical epicNoah.[35]Emma Watson played his character's wife; she first met Booth while shooting a Burberry fashion campaign in 2009: "There's something old-mannish about Doug, which he had even then. He knows who he is. He doesn't get intimidated, doesn't hold back, and is generally fearless."[36]
In September 2014, Booth starred alongsideSam Claflin,Max IronsandFreddie Foxin the black comedyThe Riot Club, directed byLone Scherfig.[37]Based on the stage play byLaura Wade, the ensemble piece centres around ten members of an exclusive Oxford University dining club known as The Riot Club, based on the real-lifeBullingdon Club.[38]Booth made "friends for life" during the film shoot, and has said of the characters: "When you meet these sort of guys, they're always so charming. It's almost more discomfiting for the audience to be charmed by them, to like them a lot, and to see how far they'll go with them."[37]In February 2015, he appeared inThe Wachowskis' science-fiction filmJupiter Ascending, starringMila Kunis,Channing TatumandEddie Redmayne. "They're just the most original people," Booth has said of the Wachowskis. "They've created something very exciting and special and bonkers."[37]He played Mr. Bingley inPride and Prejudice and Zombies(2016), an adaptation of the novelof the same namebySeth Grahame-Smith.[39][40]
In November 2017, Booth starred in the international filmLoving Vincent, as Armand Roulin, one of the models forVincent van Gogh'sRoulin Familyportraits. Booth playedMötley CrüebassistNikki Sixxin the 2019 filmThe Dirt.[41]
