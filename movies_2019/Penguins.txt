InAntarctica, Steve, anAdelie Penguin, is preparing to start a family. He tries all day to impress a mate, but fails. As he is ready to give up, he meets Adeline, a female who has not yet found a mate. Together, they start to love each other.
Sometime later, Adeline has two eggs. Steve goes off with the other males to look for fish, while Adeline huddles in her eggs in a rock nest. Later, as the other males head back to the colony, Steve, who did not realize he was the only one left, is still looking for fish. He is chased out by akiller whale, and luckily he escapes. As he makes his way back, a blizzard covers the colony, including Adeline and the eggs, but they, along with Steve, who was still in the cold, survive, and Steve and Adeline reunite. As time passes, the eggs hatch into chicks, and Steve is excited by his new children. As the chicks grow, they are threatened byskuas, who are out searching for food to feed their chicks, Steve comes to the rescue, and the skuas retreat.
As the months go by, the chicks grow into young adults, and as summer ends, the penguins return to the waters for the rest of the year. During the trip across the new ice pack, the family is soon hunted by aLeopard Seal. One of the chicks plays a trick on the predator by playing dead. The seal departs and the family reach the ocean and go their separate ways. The chicks start a new life with the others, Adeline bids farewell to Steve till the next year, and Steve takes a walk in the Antarctic beach, congratulating himself for his first year of being a father.
A year later, Steve and Adeline reunite on a rocky hill, before waddling down to the nesting grounds to start their new family.

Disneynatureis an independentfilm studiothat specializes in the production ofnature documentaryfilms forWalt Disney Pictures, a subsidiary of theWalt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned byThe Walt Disney Company. Disneynature was founded on April 21, 2008, and is headquartered inBurbank, California.
The company's nature films are consistently budgeted between $5 million to $10 million, with their distribution and marketing handled byWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.[2]The label's event films are released onEarth Dayand have a conservation campaign based on the feature of the film with an appropriate conservation charity receiving donations based on tickets sold,[3]at a pace of one per year.[4]The eight Disneynature theatrical films have a gross of $151.6 million at the box office, at an average of $19 million, withEarththe top earner at $32 million.[5]
Disney had a background in making nature films prior to the creation of Disneynature;Bambi(1942) featured forest life and was a hit.[4]From 1948 through 1960, the company produced theTrue-Life Adventuresseries, which won severalAcademy Awards.[2]Outside of film work, Disney parks were involved.Disneylandin 1955 opened theJungle Cruiseride.Walt Disney WorldincludesDisney's Animal Kingdom, which is a theme park crossed with a zoo.[4]Animal Kingdom has contributed to conservation causes by nursingendangered sea turtlesback to health, returning white rhinos to Africa and conducting a census ofcotton-top tamarins, a monkey species native to Colombia. In addition, since its creation in 1995, the Disney Wildlife Conservation Fund has given over $11 million to 650 conservation projects in 110 countries.[2]
After a long absence from nature documentaries, Disney decided to get back into the market after the French release ofMarch of the Penguins. The film was given U.S. distribution throughWarner Independent Picturesin 2005. Made on an $8 million budget, it grossed almost 10 times its budget at the U.S. box office and won theAcademy Award for Best Documentary Featurein 2006.[2]Jean-Francois Camilleri, head ofBuena Vista International Franceat the time, had the company acquire the film for the French market. Buena Vista International France also managed to obtain a 20% ownership stake in the French version of the film, butBuena Vista Pictures Distribution's bid to distribute the film in the U.S. ultimately failed.[6]Disney CEOBob Iger, in consideration of Disney's past efforts, felt thatPenguins"should have been a Disney film worldwide". This was the impetus behind the creation of Disneynature. The film's 2007 follow-up wasArctic Tale, which only took in $1.8 million worldwide.[2]Paul Baribault, Vice President of Disney Studios Marketing, led the US efforts for Disneynature from 2008 forward, overseeing all marketing, production, brand development, and conservation programmatic efforts for the label. He was eventually named general manager of Disneynature.
Disneynature was announced on April 21, 2008, a day beforeEarth Day, with a starting slate of seven films. Camilleri was set to head the new division. A multi-film production agreement was made withAlastair Fothergill,BBC'sPlanet Earthseries producer, for three scheduled films:Earth(2009),African Cats(2011) andChimpanzee(2012).[7]The other announced slate films and their release years were:The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos(2008),Oceans(2010),Orangutans: One Minute to Midnight(2010) andWings of Life(2011).[8]Original announced plans had the division releasing two films per year,[9]which was curtailed by April 2009 due to a nature film's long period needed to film wildlife.[4]No decision was made at that time as to whether or not the studio would donate the films' proceeds to conservation causes.[2]
The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingoswas the first film produced for Disneynature.[10]The first film released domestically under the new label wasEarth, opening on April 22, 2009, in the US.[2]In 2012, a Disneynature TV cable channel was launched in France. It is currently carried byFrance Telecom.[11]
Animal Planetpick up for a two-year period three Disneynature films,Oceans,African Cats, andThe Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos, in April 2012 fromDisney-ABC Domestic Television.[12]In April 2014,Jane Goodallwas named Disneynature ambassador.[13]
Disneynature has recently expanded to China with the production ofBorn in China. The production was made possible due to an expansion of Disney's relationship withShanghai Media Groupstarting in 2014.[14]FollowingBorn in China,Ghost of the MountainsandExpedition Chinawere released toNetflixto reflect the incredible journeys involved in creating these films. In 2016, the company released its first compilation film,Growing Up Wild,direct-to-video(Blu-rayandDVD) and video on demand.[15][16]
Paul Baribault, vice president of studio marketing and Disneynature, was appointed general manager of Disneynature officially in 2018, after having been operating in the capacity for several years. Camilleri resigned his posts with Disney in March 2019. Helene Etzi was appointed to take over his responsibility as head of Disney's French operations. The unit's first streaming films forDisney+wereDolphin ReefandElephant.[1]
