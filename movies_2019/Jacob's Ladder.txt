"After losing his brother in combat, soldier Jacob Singer returns home from Afghanistan — only to be pulled into a mind-twisting state of paranoia. Singer soon realizes that his sibling is alive but life is not what it seems. With his life now altered, he must figure out what is real and what is not."[3]
In 2013,The Midnight Meat Trainscreenwriter Jeff Buhler was reported to be writing a script forLD Entertainment's new version ofJacob's Ladder. According toThe Hollywood Reporter, "the producers are looking to make something more akin to anhomageand not mimic the original. The plan is to contemporize the story with new situations and characters but still maintain a story that examines issues and posesexistentialquestions".[8]
James Foleywas attached as director in November 2013.[9]By March 2016, Foley was no longer attached to the project and was replaced byDavid M. Rosenthal.[10][11]Rewrites were provided by Sarah Thorp when Buhler was unavailable to return.[12]
Buhler said that since, due to two recent wars, the American "cultural understanding of the experience of warfare and what it does to people mentally" has become "a completely different place than it was" in 1990, he decided to not be "necessarily going to the same conclusion, and finding a new way to give the audience an experience that is similar in terms of impact and feeling, but that doesn't play the same tune. It was a very tricky situation in the sense that we were trying to recreate something, but honor the spirit and concept (of the original), while telling a different story".[13]Buhler promised a different twist ending than in the original 1990 film.[14]
In March 2016, it was announcedThe Perfect GuystarMichael Ealyhad signed on to star in and executive-produce the film.[4][15]In April 2016,Jesse WilliamsandNicole Behariejoined the cast of the film,[5]followed byGuy BurnetandKarla Souzain June.[7][6]Williams described the film as "a total re-imagining of the cult classic".[16]

The site's consensus reads, "A needless remake that quickly loses sight of the themes that elevated the original, this is aJacob's Ladderthat leads straight to nowhere."[3]OnMetacriticit has aweighted averagescore of 31 out of 100 based on reviews from eight critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[27]
John DeFore ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "As jumbled as all this is, the film never achieves the kind of sweaty intensity of the original."[28]Owen GleibermanofVarietysaid the film "plays like a half-hearted sketch of the movie it could have been."[29]RogerEbert.com's Brian Tallerico gave it 1/4 stars, saying it "has some scary faces and a tacked-on commentary about PTSD and government intervention that feels cheap and unearned. Only the commitment from the always-solid Michael Ealy saves it from being one of the worst movies of the year, although just barely."[30]Noel Murray of theLos Angeles Timeswrote that the film was "less strange and scary, and more mindlessly action-packed. It doesn't feel like a dream. It's more like hearing a stranger describe a dream."[31]
