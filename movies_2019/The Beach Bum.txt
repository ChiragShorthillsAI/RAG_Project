The Beach Bumis a 2019 Americanstonercomedy filmwritten and directed byHarmony Korineand starringMatthew McConaughey,Snoop Dogg,Isla Fisher,Jimmy Buffettin his final feature film,Zac EfronandMartin Lawrence, withStefania LaVie OwenandJonah Hillin supporting roles. The plot follows the adventures of stoner poet Moondog (McConaughey) in and around theFlorida Keysas he tries to finish his new novel and fight for the respect of his daughter and his share of his wife's estate after she dies in a car accident.
The Beach Bumhad its world premiere atSouth by Southweston March 9, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 29, 2019, byNeon. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with some calling it "joyous" and others describing it as an "epic goof", though McConaughey's performance received near-universal praise.[4]The film was abox office disappointment, grossing $4.6 million worldwide on a $5 million budget.[5]
Moondog, asubstance-abusingpoet, leads ahedonisticand pseudo-nomadiclifestyle in and around theFlorida Keyswhile working on his new book. Despite perceptions that he is past his prime, he enjoys local notoriety as a legendary figure. His indulgent lifestyle is funded by his wealthy wife Minnie, which draws disapproval from their daughter Heather and agent Lewis. Throughout his journeys, Moondog engages in promiscuous relationships, while Minnie has a secret affair with his friend,R&Bsinger Lingerie.
After arriving late to Heather's wedding in Miami, Moondog's infidelity leads to a drunken altercation with the groom, Frank, in front of the guests. Later, Minnie reveals her affair during a conversation with Heather about Moondog's behavior. Meanwhile, Lingerie introduces Moondog to a potent strain of cannabis found inJamaica, which he credits for his success. At the reception, Moondog reconciles with Heather and Frank before witnessing an intimate moment between Minnie and Lingerie.
Following a night of intoxicated karaoke and dancing with Minnie, Moondog survives a car accident but Minnie succumbs to her injuries. Half of Minnie's estate goes to Heather, while Moondog's share is frozen until he completes his novel. In response, Moondog seeks revenge by vandalizing Minnie's mansion with a group of homeless individuals. To avoid imprisonment, he agrees to a year ofrehabilitationbut later escapes with apyromaniacnamed Flicker. The two engage in a night of debauchery before parting ways as Moondog makes his way back to Miami.
Back in Miami, Moondog encounters "Captain Wack," an old friend and alleged Vietnam veteran who offers him a co-captain position on dolphin tours. However, a tour withgreat white sharksresults in Captain Wack sustaining a severe injury. As the law pursues him, Moondog reunites with Lingerie, who confesses to the affair but claims Minnie truly loved him. Inspired by a dream and experience shared with Lingerie and Jimmy Buffett, Moondog adoptscrossdressingto evade detection.
The police close in on Lingerie's property, prompting Moondog to flee to Key West with Lingerie's assistance and a supply of the Jamaican weed. Motivated, Moondog completes his poetic memoir titled "The Beach Bum," which earns him a Pulitzer Prize. The lawyer informs him that his inheritance is unfrozen, and Moondog demands it in physical cash on a large sailboat. During a celebration, he sets the money on fire, causing an explosion. Moondog survives, but the crowd is preoccupied with the raining money as he drifts away on the boat, laughing.
Following the release ofSpring Breakersand time spent living in Florida, writer-directorHarmony KorinepennedThe Beach Bum, which is "based loosely on a set of characters he was hanging out with in the Keys".[6]Journalist Zach Baron noted Korine "wrote the film swiftly, and then, as he did withSpring Breakers, Korine cast a mix of well-known actors", such asMatthew McConaughey,Jonah Hill,Zac Efron,[7]Martin Lawrence,Jimmy Buffett,Snoop Dogg,Isla Fisher[8]—"and real-life Florida denizens".[6]
Speaking about the connection between the cast of Hollywood stars and the local grit of Florida, Korine said, "I like when they meet in the middle [...] Like when all the secondary characters, and all the locations, all the color, the sky, everything, it affects the main roles in a way. It's almost like a chemical reaction."[6]McConaughey described the character of Moondog as "a verb. A folk poet. A character in a Bob Dylan song dancing through life's pleasure and pain knowing every interaction is another 'note' in the tune of his life."[6]Similarly, Korine described the protagonist as a man that "lives for the second. There's no self-censor. He's just a sensualist. Whatever feels good, he just acts on it. So he does good, and he does bad."[6]The role of Moondog was written forGary Oldman, but he turned it down.
John Lesher,Steve Golin, Charles-Marie Anthonioz, Mourad Belkeddar and Nicholas Lhermitte produced the film under the LeGrisbi Productions,Anonymous Contentand Iconoclast banners. Rocket Science handled international sales commencing at the European Film Market in Berlin.[9]
Principal photographybegan in November 2017. Throughout the filming process, the cast brought their own creative direction to their characters. Snoop Dogg decided that rather than play himself, as written in Korine's script, he needed to take on a new character.
Additional strange inspiration came to Korine, as while eating a panini sandwich, the director thought that the pattern would "look good on Zac's face". The quote later went viral, whenNew Yorkercolumnist Lauren Leibowitz tweeted about the design for Efron's beard.[10]While appearing onJimmy Kimmel Live, McConaughey recounted how Snoop Dogg swapped out fake prop marijuana with "Snoop Weed". McConaughey said of the experience "the next nine hours were a whole lot of fun, but I don't believe we used one word in the English language".[11]
In May 2017,Neonacquired distribution rights to the film.[12]It had its world premiere atSouth by Southweston March 9, 2019,[13]and was theatrically released on March 29, 2019.[14]
In the United States and Canada,The Beach Bumwas released alongsideDumboandUnplanned, and was projected to gross $2–4 million from 1,100 theaters in its opening weekend.[15]The film made $650,000 on its first day, including $200,000 from Thursday night previews. It ended up debuting to just $1.8 million, the lowest wide opening of McConaughey's career.[16]
On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 127 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The role of a lifetime for Matthew McConaughey,The Beach Bumis set apart by Harmony Korine's distinctive style, but that isn't always enough to offset the unfocused story."[17]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[18]Audiences polled byPostTrakgave the film an average 2.5 out of 5 stars and a 36% "definite recommend".[16]
Rolling Stone's David Fear wrote, "Matthew McConaughey goes full 'just keep livin'' in this insane ode to fear, loathing and the art of the permanent happy hour."[19]Critic Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comnoted "theshaggy dognature of this film, one that mimics its protagonist's neverending belief that everything is just gonna be all right, all right becomes almost transcendent...The Beach Bumworks by never losing its tonal statement that all that really matters is what matters to you...man."[20]A. A. Dowd ofThe A.V. Clubgave the film a B−, noting how, "there's little plot and even less in the way of conflict... There's a collage quality to Korine's filmmaking—a sense that he's always just collecting moments, cobbling together scenes from the endless supply of improvised festivity that presumably erupted on set".[21]

NEON Rated, LLC,doing business asNeon(stylized inall caps), is an Americanindependent filmproductionanddistributioncompany founded in 2017 by CEO Tom Quinn andTim League, who also was the co-founder of theAlamo Drafthouse Cinemachain.[1]As of 2019, League is no longer involved with daily operations for the company.[6]
Its first film,Colossal, was released in 2017.[7]The company became known for distributing such notable films asI, Tonya(2017),Parasite(2019),Portrait of a Lady on Fire(2019),Palm Springs(2020),Flee(2021),Spencer(2021),The Worst Person in the World(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023),Anora(2024),Longlegs(2024),The Seed of the Sacred Fig(2024), andThe Monkey(2025).[8][9]
Parasitewent on to become Neon's highest-grossing film at the worldwidebox officewith $262 million and the first non-English-language film to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture.[10]In 2024,Longlegshad a domestic box office gross of $58.6 million, becoming the distributor's highest-grossing film ever in North America.[11]Anorabecame the company's second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[12]Neon has also worked with several high-profile filmmakers, which includesSean Baker,[13]Bong Joon-ho,Julia Ducournau,Craig Gillespie,Pablo Larraín, andCéline Sciamma.[14]
During the 4th Annual Zurich Summit, Tom Quinn commented on Neon's intent to release titles that appeal to audiences who "skew under 45, that have no aversion to violence, no aversion to foreign language and to non-fiction".[15]Explaining the success of the company in 2024, Quinn said: "We were very much a startup, with everyone functioning as this sophisticated amoeba. We very quickly found ourselves that year inTorontowith a great slate [...] That work enabled us to sit at the table in Toronto that year and buyI, Tonya. Before the ink was even dry on the deal, we were planning its Oscar campaign. It's a testament to how quickly we can make decisions because we're not this big studio. We've always used that to our advantage."[16]
In September 2017, the company partnered withBlumhouse Productionsto manage BH Tilt.[17]In 2018, a majority stake of Neon was sold to30West, the media venture arm of "The Friedkin Group".[4][18]In February 2021,Bleecker Streetpartnered with Neon to launch the joint home entertainment distribution companyDecal, which is a standalone full-service operation that handlesdistribution dealson the home entertainment rights to both Neon and Bleecker Street's features. The first film to be distributed through Decal was the Bleecker Street releaseSupernovain winter 2021.[5]Additionally, Decal acquired North American distribution rights to the South Africanhorror filmGaiafor a summertheatrical release, marking their first ever acquisition.[19]
Andrew Brown (Co-President of Decal) oversaw the launch of Neon's home entertainment division. In 2022, Brown was promoted to "President of Digital Distribution". The exec, who has served as "SVP of Digital Strategy, Marketing, and Distribution" for Neon since 2017, also manages Neon's library, and oversees the annualFYC DVD Box Setanddirect-to-consumerdigital portal "Neon Cinema".[20]Prior to the joint-venture,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, as well asThe Criterion CollectionandWell Go USA Entertainment(for the filmPossessorwhich Neon and Well Go co-distributed), distributed several Neon films onhome video.[21][22][23]
In August 2023, Neon hired formerA24employees Alexandra Altschuler as "VP Media" and Don Wilcox as "VP Marketing".[24]That same month, Neon hired former Sierra/Affinity employee Kristen Figeroid as "President of International Sales and Distribution", Laurel Charnetsky as "VP International Acquisitions & Operations", and Dan Stadnicki as "Manager, International Sales & Distribution".[25]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, Neon was approved to continue promotional activities for its films since the company does not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP) nor had encountered any issue in receivingSAG-AFTRAinterim agreements.[26][27][28]
In May 2024, Neon hired Joey Monteiro as "EVP, International Marketing" and Ashley Hirsch as "Manager of International Sales and Marketing".[29]That same month, Neon promoted Elissa Federoff from "President of Distribution" to "Chief Distribution Officer" and Ryan Friscia from "EVP, Finance and Business Development" to "Chief Financial Officer".[30]Furthermore, Jeff Deutchman, who joined Neon when it was launched, serves as "President of Acquisitions and Production".[31]
Additionally, Neon has acquired the distribution rights to fivePalme d'Orwinners at theCannes Film Festival:Parasite(2019),Titane(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023), andAnora(2024); all five won consecutively.[31][32][33]The company's strategy to acquire such titles at Cannes is to eschew "the lazy approach", said Deutchman. "The only real way to do Cannes is to go see as many movies as you can, because you never know where the nextDogtoothorBorderorHungerorForce Majeureis going to come from", he added, citing several modern Cannes standouts championed by arthouse buyers.[31]After acquiringParasitein 2018, Neon financed and distributed the film the following year in U.S. territories.[34]"From the very beginning, Tom Quinn sawParasiteas a universal film and refused to put it in a box as a foreign-language or international film", saidParasitedirectorBong Joon-ho. "He saw the heart of the film and understood that it was about all of us living in our modern class-based society. I was always grateful for that."[16]Neon spent $20 million promoting, distributing, and campaigning for the film's awards.[3]The film subsequently became Neon's highest-grossing film with more than $200 million at the worldwidebox officeand won fourAcademy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Director. Similarly, Neon spent $18 million promotingAnora, three times the film's original budget.[3]Anoraultimately won the two aforementioned Academy Awards whileAnatomy of a FallandTriangle of Sadnesswere nominated for the same two categories, among others. As of 2025, Neon has garnered 39 Academy Award nominations, winning 11 overall.[10][12][35][36]
In 2023, Quinn commented on the company's success at Cannes, saying: "We've seen over the years that each of these films, because of their credibility and success, the Palme d'Or has come to mean something quite impactful for a very young group ofcinephiles. And the reason why we know this is we've tested all these movies and dating back toParasite, probably I think, the fifth reason why people came to see the film, in itstest screeninginSherman Oaks, was the fact that it won the Palme d'Or, and each subsequent year that went up. And this year, the number one reason why people came to see the film [Anatomy of a Fall], at a test screening inBurbank, was the fact that it had won the Palme d'Or."[37]In 2024, Quinn stated: "The award means a lot. To audiences here who are looking for the absolute most adventurous, forward-looking cinema available, that award represents it because these films have delivered, and they've been major Oscar contenders."[16]
In July 2024, Neon received its biggest opening weekend at the box office with the horror thriller filmLonglegs, after scoring $22.6 million from 2,510 theaters (a figure that includes $2.5–3 million in Thursday previews) and only behindUniversal/Illumination's second weekend ofDespicable Me 4. Initially projected to gross $7–9 million, the opening marked the biggest total for an original horror film of 2024, one of the top 20 weekends for an independent film and the best opening ever for an independent horror film.[38][39][40]To promote the film, Neon utilizedguerrilla marketingtactics similar to those that led to the box office success ofThe Blair Witch Project(1999).[41]DirectorOz Perkinscredited Neon for the film's marketing, stating the studio "really responded strongly to the movie, the raw materials of the movie really excited them, the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it sounds. They asked me early on, 'Do we have your permission to kind of go nuts?' And I said, 'What else are we doing here? Go for it. Do your thing.'"[42]The film's total marketing budget was under $10 million, focusing ondigital contentand not havingtelevision ads.[38]During its third weekend,Longlegsbecame the company's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office, earning $58.6 million, surpassing whatParasiteearned with $53.3 million in 2020.[11]Furthermore, it became the top grossing R-rated horror film of 2024 and the highest-grossing indie horror film of the last decade, topping A24'sTalk to Me(2022),Insidious: Chapter 3(2015) fromFocus Features, and A24'sHereditary(2018).[11]Afterward, furthering their marketing campaign, from August 1 to 4, Neon (partnering withAtom Tickets) offered free tickets to anyone who has a birthday that falls on the 14th of any given month. To get the tickets, those who registered and purchased tickets through Atom Tickets received a special promo code after verifying their date of birth and were able to get one free ticket per customer, while supplies lasted.[43]

Harmony Korine(born January 4, 1973) is an American filmmaker, actor, photographer, artist, and author. His methods feature an erratic, loose and transgressive aesthetic, exploring taboo themes and incorporatingexperimentaltechniques,[1][2]and works with art, music, fashion and advertising.[3][4]
Korine's career began when he wrote the screenplay for theLarry ClarkfilmKids(1995), which was followed by his directorial debut,Gummo(1997). His films typically explore unconventional narratives and themes of dysfunctional families, and also includeMister Lonely(2007),Spring Breakers(2012), andThe Beach Bum(2019).
Korine foundedEDGLRD, a creative and technology company, in 2023, with his filmAggro Dr1ft(2023) being one of the company's first projects.[5]
Korine was born to aJewishfamily inBolinas, California, the son of Eve and Sol Korine.[6]His father was anIranian Jewishimmigrant.[7]His father was a tapdancer and produced documentaries forPBSin the 1970s about an "array of colorful Southern characters"; he would take Korine to carnivals and circuses[8]and taught him how to use aBolexcamera.[9]As a child, Korine watched movies with his father, who rentedBuster Keatonfilms for Korine and took him to seeWerner Herzog'sEven Dwarfs Started Small(1970) in the theater. Korine reminisced that "I knew there was a poetry in cinema that I had never seen before that was so powerful."[10][11]
Korine spent his early childhood in theSan Francisco Bay Arealiving with his family on acommune.[12][13]In the early 1980s, they relocated toNashville, Tennessee,[13]where he attendedHillsboro High Schoolbefore moving to New York City to live with his grandmother.[14]As a teenager, Korine spent his summers in San Francisco, "skateboarding, living on rooftops, running away from my parents, getting in fights. You know, girls. At that point I was just getting into movies, but the idea of making films happened later in high school."[15]He began frequenting revival theaters, watching films byJohn Cassavetes,Werner Herzog,Jean-Luc Godard,Robert Altman,Rainer Werner FassbinderandAlan Clarke. In an interview withBruce LaBruce, Korine briefly mentioned that he studied Business Administration in college. Other sources[16]state that he studied Dramatic Writing atTisch School of the ArtsatNew York Universityfor one semester before dropping out to pursue a career as a professional skateboarder.
Korine was skating with friends inWashington Square Parkwhen he met photographerLarry Clark.[17]Impressed, the photographer asked him to compose a script about skaters and to include in the plot a teenage AIDS experience.[18]Korine told Clark, "I've been waiting all my life to write this story."[19]Within three weeks, Korine wroteKids, a film about 24 hours in the sex- and drug-filled lives of severalManhattanteenagers in New York City during theAIDScrisis.[20]Kidsreceived mixed reviews at the time of its release in 1995, but has since become a significantcult film. Among others, the film featuresChloë SevignyandRosario Dawsonin their first movie roles. The film, while controversial, jumpstarted Korine's career. This put him into contact with film producerCary Woodswho budgeted about $1 million to produceGummo, Korine's personal vision.[17]
In 1997, Korine wrote and directedGummo, a film based on life inXenia, Ohio, a town devastated bya tornadoin the early 1970s. Forgoing conventional narrative,Gummois a nonlinear, fragmented series of sketches written by Korine. Only five experienced actors worked on the movie; much of the cast was found during preproduction in Tennessee. The film is notable for having unsettling, often bizarre scenes, as well as its dreamlike soundtrack, which strengthens the disconcerting atmosphere. It features "an eclectic soundtrack includingdeath metal,MadonnaandRoy Orbison.[21]
It premiered at the 24thTelluride Film Festivalon August 29, 1997. During the screening, numerous people got up and left during the initial cat drowning sequence. Three months later,Werner Herzogcalled Korine to give praise to the film overall, especially the bacon taped to the wall during the bathtub scene. He toldThe New York Times, "When I saw a piece of fried bacon fixed to the bathroom wall inGummo, it knocked me off my chair. [Korine's] a very clear voice of a generation of filmmakers that is taking a new position. It's not going to dominate world cinema, but so what?"[22]
Although a majority of mainstream critics derided it as an unintelligible mess, it won top prizes at that year'sVenice Film Festivaland earned Korine the respect of noted filmmakers such asGus Van Sant, among others.  It has been called "unlike anything you've seen in a while – maybe ever" – and that "if you're the kind of person who claims to be frustrated by the predictability of commercial filmmaking, [it presents] a rare opportunity to put your money where your mouth is."[23]
In 1998, Korine releasedThe Diary of Anne Frank Pt II, a 40-minute three-screen collage featuring a boy burying his dog, kids insatanicdress vomiting on aBible, and a man inblackfacedancing and singing "My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean". It utilizes some of the same actors and themes asGummo, and can be considered a companion piece as the film utilises footage that didn't make the final cut ofGummo. The film "further disgusted critics"[18]and solidified his status as a notoriously shocking and experimental director.
Julien Donkey-Boy, released in 1999, included a signedDogme 95manifesto. While it broke a number of the movement's basic tenets,Lars von Trierlauded Korine's ability to interpret the rules creatively.[citation needed]
The story is told from the perspective of a young man suffering from untreatedschizophrenia, played byEwen Bremner, as he tries to understand his deteriorating world. Julien's abusive and arguably hypersensitive father is played by Werner Herzog. At one point, Korine was to play the son, but he backed down and was replaced by Bremner.
LikeGummoandKids, it too has since become something of a cult classic, a go-to film for those seeking cinema that is, as Roger Ebert said in his three star review, "shocking for most moviegoers", unlike "the slick aboveground indie productions" that are now the norm.[24]
In 2000,The Devil, The Sinner, and His Journeypremiered, which featured Korine in black metalcorpsepaintasO. J. SimpsonandJohnny DeppasKato Kaelin. That same year, Korine directed the short film Korine Tap for Stop For a Minute, a series of short films commissioned byDazed & Confusedmagazine and FilmFour Lab. The film featured Korine tap dancing while wearingblackface.[25][26]
In 2002,Larry ClarkmadeKen Park, based on a script Korine had written several years earlier. The film, another adult tale of youth gone awry, was not distributed in the United States. At the time of its release, Clark and Korine had long since parted ways, and Korine had no involvement in its production.
In 2003, he made the television documentaryAbove the Belowabout his friend and collaboratorDavid Blaineand his 44-day stunt in a park over the bank ofRiver Thamesin London inside a suspendedplexiglasbox. A documentary commissioned bySky TelevisionandChannel 4, it also includes jokes, visual poetry, and music. In addition, Korine has worked with Blaine on a number of Blaine's specials.
He first met his wife,Rachel (Simon) Korine, a 17-year-old fromNashville, around this time.
His third feature film,Mister Lonely, was co-written by his brother, Avi Korine, and starredDiego Luna,Samantha Morton,Denis Lavant,Anita Pallenberg,David Blaine,Werner Herzogand Mal Whiteley. The movie was released in 2008 and debuted at Cannes.[27]His largest film, with a budget of $8.2 million,[28]it received mixed reviews and earned $386,915 in its first 9 months.[29]
The film is the story of "a young American man lost in Paris. He scratches out a living as aMichael Jacksonlook-alike, dancing in the streets, in public parks, at tourist spots and trade shows. Different from everyone else, he feels as if he's floating between two worlds. During a show at a geriatric home Michael Jackson meetsMarilyn Monroe. Haunted by her angelic beauty he follows her to a commune in the Highlands, joining her husbandCharlie Chaplinand her daughterShirley Temple. The commune is a place where everyone is famous and "no-one gets old". Here, ThePope, TheQueen of the United Kingdom,Madonna,James Deanand other impersonators build a stage in the hope that the world will visit and watch them perform. Everything is beautiful. Until the world shifts, and reality intrudes on their utopian dream."[30]
Korine also appeared in the 2007documentary filmBeautiful Losersin which his life and career were one focus of the film, along with other artists such asMike Mills,Shepard Fairey,Margaret Kilgallen, Jo Jackson andBarry McGee. In the documentary, Korine discusses his motivation as an artist and filmmaker, as well as his inspiration for creating films he has never seen. Footage also appears from one of Korine's rare, early, and untitled short films, which preceded his work onKids.
In 2008 Korine was signed to MJZ for worldwide commercial representation.
On 6 September 2009 Korine's filmTrash Humpers[31]premiered as part of the Visions section of the2009 Toronto International Film Festival.[32]Despite being a work of fiction, the film went on to win the top award at the prominent Europeandocumentary filmfestival CPH:DOX –Copenhagen International Documentary Festival– in November 2009.
In March 2011, Korine released a short film entitledUmshini Wam, which is a popularZulustruggle song meaning "bring me my machine gun". The film starred Ninja and Yo-Landi ofDie Antwoord. In September 2011, Korine released a short film entitledSnowballs, sponsored by theProenza Schoulerfashion label.
Korine's next project was the crime dramaSpring Breakers, which was produced in 2012 inFlorida, and starredJames Franco,Selena Gomez,Vanessa Hudgens,Ashley Benson, and Korine's wife,Rachel Korine. In looking at early scenes being filmed and in speaking toward the plot, cast, and earlier works of the filmmaker,Indiewirewrote "this might be the weirdest movie the director has ever made simply by nature of being totally unlike his previous work."[33]"That Mr. Korine appears to be having it both (or many) ways may seem like a cop-out, but only if you believe that the role of the artist is to be a didact or a scold",[34]wroteThe New York Times. Principal filming wrapped up on March 30, 2012.[35][36]The film was selected to compete for theGolden Lionat the69th Venice International Film Festival.[37]where it had its world premiere, and later was shown at theToronto International Film Festivalbefore being released to the general public in March 2013.[33][38]
Korine's featureThe Beach Bumwas released in 2019, starringMatthew McConaugheyas Moondog,Isla Fisheras his wife Minnie,Martin Lawrenceas Captain Wack, andSnoop Doggas Lingerie.[39][40]
In 2023, Korine releasedAggro Dr1ftstarringCatalanactorJordi MollàandTravis Scott. The film premiered at the80th Venice International Film Festival, and was produced and distributed by his companyEDGLRD.[41]
Korine's next feature film, also with EDGLRD, isBaby Invasion, shot from a first-person shooter perspective.[42]
Korine has not primarily regarded himself as a director, instead describing a "unified aesthetic" that his filmography explores as much as his art and photography.[1]Much of his filmography, including his screenplays, explores themes of dysfunctional families, mental disorders, abuse, hedonism, poverty and various subcultures, withunreliable narratorsand acollageof perspectives.[43]This is often presented experimentally, with many of Korine's films incorporatingPolaroids,Super 8,35mm filmandVHSrecordings, such as inGummoandJulien Donkey-Boy.Improvisationis also an important filmmaking technique for Korine, as a way to maintain his films as "living thing[s]."[12]Korine has described the social, psychological and subcultural aspects of his films as constituting what he describes as the "American Landscape".[44]
Korine creditedtap-dance,vaudevilleandminstrelsyas influences on his work in the 1990s and 2000s,[45]with him especially naming the comedy ofFanny Brice,Eddie CantorandAl Jolsonas inspirations for his intentionally stilted style of presentation and humor.[46]Like vaudeville, the style of Korine's work is presentational and works purely by thematic association. He has compared with this to viewing picture books of assorted photos, which would be seemingly devoid of context, but because they are compiled and presented in succession, a narrative is formed, and Korine has said thatGummoand his subsequent films were written in this fashion,[46]striving to retain a "margin of the undefined."[47]In 2009, he summarized an ideal setting in his aesthetic as "an abandoned parking lot and a soiled sofa on the edge [...] with a street lamp off to the side. America seems like a series of abandoned parking lots, streetlights and abandoned sofas." Ensuing from this, the setting appears frequently in his filmTrash Humpers(2009).[48]
In 1997, Korine's favorite writers were listed as the humoristsJames ThurberandS. J. Perelman, as well as theSouthern GothicnovelistFlannery O'Connor.[49]He also credited the philosopherWalter Benjaminas an influence.[50]In recent years, Korine has praised rapper and collaboratorGucci Mane.[51]
Korine has noted British filmmakerAlan Clarkeas a strong inspiration on his filmmaking, especially with regards to his realism and use of extensive scenes.[52]In 1999, he listed his top ten films asPixotebyHéctor Babenco,BadlandsandDays of HeavenbyTerrence Malick,Fat CitybyJohn Huston,StroszekbyWerner Herzog,The Killing of a Chinese BookieandA Woman Under the InfluencebyJohn Cassavetes,McCabe and Mrs. MillerbyRobert Altman,Out of the BluebyDennis HopperandHail MarybyJean-Luc Godard.[1]
Despite the scorn of a majority of mainstream reviewers, Korine has won festival prizes at Venice and Rotterdam among others. Established directors such asBernardo BertolucciandGus Van Santare also outspoken proponents of Korine's work, with Van Sant sayingGummo"changed his life"[49]and Bertolucci saying Korine "created a revolution in the language of cinema."[53]
Korine was initially frequently labeled as an enfant terrible and was often accused of exploitation and self-indulgence; he responded in 1997, asking "How can an artist be expected not to be self-indulgent? That's the whole thing that's wrong with filmmaking today [...] To me, art is one man's voice, one idea, one point-of-view, coming from one person."[54]Korine feels there is no need to justify or explain the images he puts to the screen, clarifying that they are simply the result of "a cinema of passion and obsession."[46]He has added that "I mostly just make things to entertain myself and at the same time hope that there's some type of audience that likes what I'm doing."[55]Korine has also stated that "film is like a dead art because of people not taking chances",[54]and has shown his preference for "auteuristworks".[56]He stated in 1999 that "In another ten or fifteen years, the people that understand and appreciateGummoor my work will be in positions of power", declaring that the culture presented in his art was going to become more prominent.[1]
Korine has said that his films are created with the premise that if there is at least one image that sticks with you after viewing a film and makes you change your perspective on cinema, then it is a success.[49]Roger Ebertsubsequently said in his review ofJulien Donkey-Boythat "Korine, who at 25 is one of the most untamed new directors, belongs on the list withGodard,Cassavetes,Herzog,Warhol,Tarkovsky,Brakhageand others who smash conventional movies and reassemble the pieces ... Harmony Korine is the real thing, an innovative and gifted filmmaker whose work forces us to see on his terms."[24]
Korine has published a number of books.A Crack Up at the Race Riots, an experimental book of fragments which he jokingly described in press appearances and interviews as his attempt to write "the Great AmericanChoose Your Own Adventurenovel", was published in 1998 by Drag City.

The university describes the exhibition, which ran through February 26, 2009, as culling "together a number of photographs from Korine's private files in order to reveal a side of the artist's creative process that remains largely unexamined. Depicting an unnamed, mysterious young girl moving through a televised landscape of shifting contexts, Pigxote further illustrates Korine's interest in replacing plot lines and expected narrative tropes with intuitively arranged "experiential moments." They also provide a unique insight into the poetic mind of Nashville's most compelling prodigal son."[57]In 2003 his works were presented at an exhibition atagnès b's Galerie du jour in Paris, with whom Korine has often been associated. In 2010, Korine collaborated with New York Visual Artist Bill Saylor on the bookHo Bags.The book consists of drawing and paintings in which Korine and Saylor drew over each other's works.

In a 1996 interview withThe Sun-Herald, she spoke of her success and experiences on the show: "I would be stupid to let it go to my head because it could all end tomorrow and I would just fade back into obscurity. I like working onHome and Awaybut it's a heavy workload so I get stressed out a lot. We work about 15 hours a day, including the time it takes to learn lines. I know a lot of people work those sort of hours but I think we really feel it because most of us are young and fairly inexperienced. But I am very grateful because it is good experience. It's like an apprenticeship, but we do it in front of 20 million people so all our mistakes are up for the world to see."[13]For her performance in the series, Fisher received nominations forMost Popular New Talentat the 1995Logie Awards,[14]and forMost Popular Actressat the 1997 ceremony.[15]

AlthoughScooby-Dooreceived negative reviews, the film was a commercial success, grossing US$275.7 million worldwide.[20]On that early stage in her career, Fisher remarked: "I only came out on the back of the movie for the premiere ofScooby Doo. And then, I ended up getting representation and ended up getting a job, almost straight away. So, I was fortunate, in that I didn't have to come out to L.A. and join a queue of however many people, and try to get work. I came in on the back of what was deemed as a big studio movie that had had extraordinary success".[21]She subsequently played supporting roles in the independent filmDallas 362(2003) and the Australian comedyThe Wannabes(also 2003). In his review for the latter, David Rooney ofVarietyfelt that Fisher "adds easy charm and a thinly developed hint of romantic interest", in what he summed as an "uneven but endearing farce about breaking into showbiz".[22]In the comedyI Heart Huckabees(2004), directed byDavid O. Russell, she played what was described as a "punchy little part", by newspaperThe Age.[23]

On her part in the film, she remarked: "It was an interesting character to play, because she was so crazy and lacking in any kind of social etiquette. She doesn't care what anyone thinks." For one particular scene, involving sexual content, she used abody double. "I negotiated that from the beginning, trying to analyse why. I find pornographic violence, just gratuitous and unnecessary than nudity, because there's nothing more peaceful and beautiful".[25]The film was favourably received by critics and made US$285.1 million worldwide.[26]Empiremagazine found Fisher to be an "unexpected, scene-stealing joy",[27]and her performance earned her theBest Breakthrough Performance Awardat the 2006MTV Movie Awardsand twoTeen Choice Awardsnominations.

Describing on how she took her character, she said: "It was one of those situations where I read the script and thought, 'This is the take. I don't want to play the cliché femme fatale. I don't want to come in and be the woman with the sexual appetite, who wants to take down this man. I want to come in and make her this big beating heart, and innocent a woman who has no identity, who knows the man she's with, who doesn't have an agenda.' Because every character in the script has an agenda. I thought how interesting if my character doesn't have one if she's a victim of her own kindness. So, that was my starting point."[21]WhileThe Lookoutreceived a limited release, the film was favourably received.[31]The comedyHot Rod(also 2007), withAndy Samberg, saw Fisher star as the college-graduate neighbour on whom an amateur stuntman has a crush.

She felt "apprehensive" as she took on her firststar vehicle, stating: "I was gobsmacked that anyone would give me my own movie. I am eternally bewildered.
