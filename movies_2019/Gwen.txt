Gwen, a young farm girl inNorth Wales, is out playing with her sister Mari. They pass a neighbouring farmhouse where a group of men are tending to some dead bodies. The village doctor says that the entire family died ofcholera. Gwen is chastised by her mother for being late and for burning their supper. Her father is not around, for an undisclosed reason. During the night, Gwen wakes and hears a commotion outside, she goes outside but is unable to see anything because of the stormy weather.
The next day, the family goes to church. As they leave, Gwen's mother has a brief conversation with a man, which seems to leave both of them disturbed. On their return home, they find an animal heart nailed to their front door. The heart is thrown into the fireplace and Gwen's mother seems to go into a trance. The following day, Gwen finds their crops have spoiled. That night, Gwen asks about the man her mother spoke to, and asks if she is planning to sell the house, which her mother denies.
The following day, Gwen awakes to see her mother standing in the pasture among their entire flock of sheep, all of which are dead and mutilated. Gwen goes to investigate the house of the neighbours who died. She observes bloody hand prints throughout the house and rotting food on the table as if something sudden and violent had happened. Mother finds her in the house and it is revealed that the neighbours' sheep died in a similar way before the family died. Later, Mother chastises Gwen for entering the house and refuses to listen when Gwen points out the similarities to their own situation.
Back at home, Mother has a violentseizure. Gwen puts her to bed and takes care of Mari. The next day, though still weak and ill, Mother insist on going to church, where she experiences another seizure, prompting attention from the village doctor, Doctor Wren. He prescribes three bottles of atonic wine, as they have no money, Gwen takes one bottle with the promise to pay him back after the next market. Wren says that the payment is due to the Quarry, which owns his practice. With her mother still ill, Gwen goes to retrieve eggs from the hen but finds that a rat has destroyed the eggs. After supper, Gwen finds her mothercuttingher arms and letting the blood flow into a bowl.
The following day, Gwen bags up vegetables to sell at the market. While at the market, the villagers seem to be intentionally ignoring Gwen as she attempts to sell vegetables. She notices she is getting odd, unsettling looks from some people. A young man who smiled at Gwen in church attempts to buy some carrots from her but his father forces him to leave. As she returns home, a flash of lightning frightens her horse, which escapes and runs off.
It later returns to the farm with severely injured legs, and needs to be put down. Men from the Quarry come to the farm to see Mother. Gwen eavesdrops on the conversation, and hears the men claim Gwen stole the tonic (which is Quarry property) and offer to overlook the theft if she sells the land. Mother sends them away and attempts to force Gwen to chop up the horse for meat as punishment. When Gwen refuses, Mother begins angrily hacking off the horse's head with a hatchet, and has another seizure. That night, Gwen has a nightmare about her mother being possessed.
Mother instructs Gwen to retrieve a letter from a box and tells her it arrived shortly after Father left. As Gwen reads the letter she discovers that Father is not returning, for reasons that are unclear, and that Mother has been concealing this from the girls.
A man approaches the farmhouse at night with a dagger. Mother goes outside to investigate and Gwen wakes up and follows. While outside the man approaches them, hits Mother and drags her back to the house, locking Gwen outside. Gwen retrieves ahatchetand breaks the lock. The man attacks Gwen and tries to choke her. Mother seizes the opportunity and slits the man's throat with the dagger he dropped. Knowing more men are coming, she tells Gwen to get Mari. The man from the quarry arrives with a band of men. He hits Gwen's mother and pours liquid on her. He sets her on fire and tells the men toburn down the house.
Gwen and Mari escape into the hills and are watching from a distance. Mari asks Gwen where they will go. Gwen tells Mari they will go find their father.

TheBritish Film Institute(BFI) is a film and television charitable organisation which promotes and preserves film-making and television in the United Kingdom. The BFI uses funds provided by theNational Lotteryto encourage film production, distribution, and education. It is sponsored by theDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport,[2]and partially funded under theBritish Film Institute Act 1949.[3]
The BFI was established in 1933 to encourage the development of the arts of film, television and the moving image throughout the United Kingdom, to promote their use as a record of contemporary life and manners, to promote education about film, television and the moving image generally, and their impact on society, to promote access to and appreciation of the widest possible range of British andworld cinemaand to establish, care for and develop collections reflecting the moving image history and heritage of the United Kingdom.[4]
The BFI maintains the world's largestfilm archive, theBFI National Archive, previously calledNational Film Library(1935–1955), National Film Archive (1955–1992), and National Film and Television Archive (1993–2006). The archive contains more than 50,000 fiction films, over 100,000 non-fiction titles, and around 625,000 television programmes. The majority of the collection is British material but it also features internationally significant holdings from around the world. The Archive also collects films which feature key British actors and the work of British directors.[citation needed]
The BFI runs theBFI Southbank(formerly the National Film Theatre (NFT)) and theBFI IMAXcinema, both located on the south bank of theRiver Thamesin London.[5]The IMAX has the largest cinema screen in the UK and shows popular recent releases and short films showcasing its technology, which includes IMAX 70mm screenings, IMAX 3D screenings and 11,600 watts of digital surround sound.[6]BFI Southbank shows films from all over the world, particularly critically acclaimed historical and specialised films that may not otherwise get a cinema showing. The BFI also distributes archival and cultural cinema to other venues – each year to more than 800 venues all across the UK, as well as to a substantial number of overseas venues.[7]
The BFI offers a range of education initiatives, in particular to support the teaching of film and media studies in schools.[8]In late 2012, the BFI received money from theDepartment for Educationto create the BFI Film Academy Network for young people aged between 16 and 25.[9][10][11]A residential scheme is held at theNFTSevery year.
The BFI runs the annualLondon Film Festivalalong withBFI Flare: London LGBT Film Festivaland the youth-orientatedFuture Film Festival.[12]
The BFI publishes the monthlySight & Soundmagazine, as well as films onBlu-ray, DVD and books. It runs the BFI National Library (a reference library), and maintains theBFI Film & TV Databaseand Summary of Information on Film and Television (SIFT), which are databases of credits, synopses and other information about film and television productions. SIFT has a collection of about 7 millionstill framesfrom film and television.
The BFI has co-produced a number of television series featuring footage from the BFI National Archive, in partnership with theBBC, includingThe Lost World of Mitchell & Kenyon,The Lost World of Friese-GreeneandThe Lost World of Tibet.
The BFI has also produced contemporary artists' moving image work, most notably through the programme of theBFI Gallery, which was located atBFI Southbankfrom March 2007 to March 2011. The programme of the gallery resulted in several new commissions by leading artists, including projects which engaged directly with the BFI National Archive, among which arePatrick Keiller's 'The City of the Future',Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard's 'RadioMania: An Abandoned Work' and Deimantas Narkevicious' 'Into the Unknown'. The Gallery also initiated projects by film-makers such asMichael Snow,Apichatpong Weerasethakul,Jane and Louise WilsonandJohn Akomfrah.[13][14]
The BFI also operates a streaming service called BFI Player. This streaming service offers a variety of niche and art films.[15]
The institute was founded in 1933.[16]Despite its foundation resulting from a recommendation in a report onFilm in National Life, at that time the institute was a private company, though it has received public money throughout its history. This came from thePrivy Counciland Treasury until 1965, and from the various culture departments since then.
The institute was restructured following the Radcliffe Report of 1948, which recommended that it should concentrate on developing the appreciation of filmic art, rather than creating film itself. Thus control of educational film production passed to the National Committee for Visual Aids in Education and theBritish Film Academyassumed control for promoting production. From 1952 to 2000, the BFI provided funding for new and experimental film-makers via theBFI Production Board.
The institute received aroyal charterin 1983. This was updated in 2000, and in the same year the newly establishedUK Film Counciltook responsibility for providing the BFI's annual grant-in-aid (government subsidy). As an independent registered charity, the BFI is regulated by theCharity Commissionand the Privy Council.
In 1988, the BFI opened the LondonMuseum of the Moving Image(MOMI) on theSouth Bank. MOMI was acclaimed internationally and set new standards for education through entertainment, but it did not receive the high levels of continuing investment that might have enabled it to keep pace with technological developments and ever-rising audience expectations. The museum was "temporarily" closed in 1999 when the BFI stated that it would be re-sited. This did not happen, and MOMI's closure became permanent in 2002 when it was decided to redevelop the South Bank site. This redevelopment was itself then further delayed.
The BFI is currently managed on a day-to-day basis by its chief executive, Ben Roberts. Supreme decision-making authority rests with a chair and a board of up to 15 governors. The current chair isJay Hunt, a television executive, who took up the post in February 2024.[17]Governors, including the Chair, are appointed by theSecretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.
The BFI operates with three sources of income. The largest is public money allocated by theDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport. For the year 2021–22, the BFI received £74.31m from the DCMS as Grant-in-Aid funding.[18]The second largest source is commercial activity such as receipts from ticket sales at BFI Southbank or the BFI London IMAX theatre (£5m in 2007), sales of DVDs, etc. Thirdly, grants and sponsorship of around £5m are obtained from various sources, includingNational Lotteryfunding grants, private sponsors and through donations (J. Paul Getty, Jr., who died in 2003, left the BFI a legacy of around £1m in his will). The BFI is also the distributor for all Lottery funds for film (in 2011–12 this amounted to c.£25m).[citation needed]
As well as its work on film, the BFI also devotes a large amount of its time to the preservation and study of British television programming and its history. In 2000, it published a high-profile list of the100 Greatest British Television Programmes, as voted for by a range of industry figures.[citation needed]
The delayed redevelopment of the National Film Theatre finally took place in 2007, creating in the rebranded "BFI Southbank" new education spaces, a contemporary art gallery dedicated to the moving image[19](theBFI Gallery), and a pioneering mediatheque which for the first time enabled the public to gain access, free of charge, to some of the otherwise inaccessible treasures in the National Film & Television Archive. The mediatheque has proved to be the most successful element of this redevelopment, and there are plans to roll out a network of them across the UK.[citation needed]
An announcement of a £25 million capital investment in the Strategy for UK Screen Heritage was made by Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport at the opening night of the 2007 London Film Festival. The bulk of this money paid for long overdue development of the BFI National Archive facilities in Hertfordshire and Warwickshire.[citation needed]
During 2009, theUK Film Councilpersuaded the government that there should only be one main public-funded body for film, and that body should be the UKFC, while the BFI should be abolished. In 2010, the government announced that there would be a single body for film. Despite intensive lobbying (including, controversially, using public funding to pay public relations agencies to put its case forward), the UKFC failed to persuade the government that it should have that role and, instead, the BFI took over most of the UKFC's functions and funding from 1 April 2011, with the UKFC being subsequently abolished. Since then, the BFI has been responsible for all Lottery funding for film—originally in excess of £25m p.a., and currently in excess of £40m p.a.[citation needed]
The BFI Film Academy forms part of the BFI's overall 5–19 Education Scheme. The programme is being supported by theDepartment for Educationin England who have committed £1m per annum funding from April 2012 and 31 March 2015. It is also funded through theNational Lottery,Creative ScotlandandNorthern Ireland Screen.
On 29 November 2016, the BFI announced that over 100,000 television programmes are to bedigitisedbefore the video tapes, which currently have an estimated five-to-six-year shelf life, become unusable. The BFI aims to make sure that the television archive is still there in 200 years' time.[20]
The BFI announced in February 2021 that it is teaming up with American diversity and inclusion program #StartWith8Hollywood founded byThuc Doan Nguyento make it global.[21]
The BFI is currently chaired byJay Huntand run by CEO Ben Roberts and deputy CEO Harriet Finney.
