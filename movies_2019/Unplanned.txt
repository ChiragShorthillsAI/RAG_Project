She may be best known as a dancer and spokesperson for musicianPrince, or for appearing asJenny Calendarin 14 episodes of the television seriesBuffy the Vampire Slayer.
Scott was born in the New York CityboroughofQueensin 1970 and grew up in several locations including theFlorida KeysandOcean City, Maryland. She is named after her father, Robert LaMorte. After being inspired by the 1983 movieFlashdance, she began dancing and taking after-school lessons injazz dance,ballet, andtap dance.  She attended theLos Angeles County High School for the Artsas a dance major during the school's first year of operation, and then received a full scholarship to the Dupree Dance Academy in Hollywood. At sixteen, she began working as a backup dancer inmusic videos, first appearing inDebbie Gibson's "Shake Your Love".
After having appeared in more than thirty music videos and toured in a six-dancer troupe with thePet Shop Boys, LaMorte was picked by Prince to be one of two lead dancers for the music video for "Cream", a single from his 1991 albumDiamonds and Pearls.[1]Prince had originally sought identical twins, but chose LaMorte along with another dancer, Lori Elle, because of their similar appearance and the dance chemistry they had with him.  Elle as "Diamond" and LaMorte as "Pearl" subsequently appeared in the videos for "Cream", "Gett Off", "Strollin'", andthe album's title track, as well as on the album'sholographiccover itself.  LaMorte and Elle then toured Europe with Prince, and when he temporarily refused to do any public speaking, the two women served as his spokespersons and conducted the main promotional efforts forDiamonds and Pearls.
Elle would later go on tour withRicky MartinandMichael Jackson.
At the age of 22, LaMorte retired from dance and turned to acting. After doing numerous television commercials, she landed the role ofJason Priestley's girlfriend Jill Fleming onBeverly Hills, 90210in two episodes and played the female lead (alongsideAndrew Bowen) in thelive actionvideo gameFox Hunt.[2]Her first regular role was as high school teacher and technopagan Jenny Calendar on the first two seasons ofBuffy the Vampire Slayer.[3][4]After her character was killed during the second season, she returned for two more episodes as a ghost. In the second season finale "Becoming, Part Two" she makes a brief appearance as a hypnosis induced suggestion by Drusilla to trick Rupert Giles into revealing the flaw in Angel's plan. Finally she returned during the third season episode "Amends" to play a false apparition of the dead Calendar, a guise assumed by the evil force known as "theFirst Evil".[5]However, LaMorte had become aborn-again Christianafter a highway encounter with aChristian biker gangwhile she was praying for a sign from God.[6]After having already accepted the guest appearance on her old show, she was upset to learn that she would be playing an equivalent ofSatan.[7]
After her role ended onBuffy, LaMorte periodically accepted guest starring roles on various television shows, before retiring from acting to focus her efforts on Christian counseling, although she was occasionally seen in commercials and smaller roles.  She also spends some of her time preaching Christianity and selling audio CDs on her website that give accounts of her religious conversion and beliefs.  In an FAQ on that site, LaMorte writes that while she was once a proponent ofNew Agebeliefs, she rejected them after her conversion to Christianity. She criticizes these beliefs as a form of "earth worship" and characterizes the practice ofwitchcrafta dangerous opening for demonic influence.[8]She later returned to acting, appearing in the filmUnplanned.[9]
As of 2020, LaMorte is married under the last name Scott. She has one daughter. She is a committed Christian, and describes her conversion on her website.[10]
