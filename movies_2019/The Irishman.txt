Tribeca Enterprises(formerTribeca Productions) is an American film and television production company co-founded in 1989 by actorRobert De Niroand producerJane Rosenthalin thelower Manhattanneighborhood ofTribeca, which is where the company got its name.[1]
The production company was founded in 1989 at the beginning of a revival of interest in the film production community infilming in New York City.[2]Prior to the 1990s it made more economic sense for production companies to film urban scenes in cities such asMontreal,Toronto, andVancouverinCanada. Since the founding of Tribeca Productions other production facilities have moved into various neighborhoods in NYC and filming around the city and in the streets has again become commonplace.
In 2003, Robert De Niro, Jane Rosenthal, andCraig Hatkoffmoved Tribeca Productions to become a part ofTribeca Enterprises, which organizes theTribeca Film Festival,Tribeca Film Festival International, Tribeca Cinemas, andTribeca Films.[3]

Martin Charles Scorsese(/skɔːrˈsɛsi/skor-SESS-ee,[1][2]Italian:[skorˈseːze,-se]; born November17, 1942) is an American filmmaker. He emerged as one of the major figures of theNew Hollywoodera. He has receivedmany accolades, including anAcademy Award, fourBAFTA Awards, threeEmmy Awards, aGrammy Award, and threeGolden Globe Awards. He has been honored with theAFI Life Achievement Awardin 1997, theFilm Society of Lincoln Centertribute in 1998, theKennedy Center Honorin 2007, theCecil B. DeMille Awardin 2010, and theBAFTA Fellowshipin 2012. Four of his films have been inducted into theNational Film Registryby theLibrary of Congressas "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant".
Scorsese received a Master of Arts degree fromNew York University'sSteinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Developmentin 1968. His directorial debut,Who's That Knocking at My Door(1967), was accepted into theChicago Film Festival. In the 1970s and 1980s,Scorsese's films, much influenced by hisItalian-Americanbackground and upbringing in New York City, centered on macho-posturing men and explore crime, machismo,nihilismandCatholicconcepts of guilt and redemption.[3][4]His trademark styles include extensive use ofslow motionandfreeze frames, graphic depictions of extreme violence and liberal use ofprofanity.Mean Streets(1973) was a blueprint for his filmmaking styles.
Scorsese won thePalme d'OratCanneswithTaxi Driver(1976), which starredRobert De Niroas a disturbed Vietnam Veteran. De Niro becameassociated with Scorsese through eight more filmsincludingNew York, New York(1977),Raging Bull(1980),The King of Comedy(1982),Goodfellas(1990),Casino(1995) andThe Irishman(2019). In the following decades, he garnered box office success with aseries of collaborationswithLeonardo DiCaprio, includingGangs of New York(2002),The Aviator(2004),The Departed(2006),Shutter Island(2010), andThe Wolf of Wall Street(2013). He worked with both De Niro and DiCaprio onKillers of the Flower Moon(2023). He also directedAfter Hours(1985),The Color of Money(1986),The Last Temptation of Christ(1988),The Age of Innocence(1993),Kundun(1997),Hugo(2011), andSilence(2016).
On television, he has directed episodes for theHBOseriesBoardwalk Empire(2010–2014) andVinyl(2016), as well as the HBO documentaryPublic Speaking(2010) and theNetflixdocu-seriesPretend It's a City(2021). He has also directed several rock documentaries includingThe Last Waltz(1978),No Direction Home(2005), andShine a Light(2008). He has explored film history in the documentariesA Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies(1995) andMy Voyage to Italy(1999).[5]An advocate forfilm preservationandrestoration, he has founded three nonprofit organizations:The Film Foundationin 1990, theWorld Cinema Foundationin 2007 and the African Film Heritage Project in 2017.[6]
Martin Charles Scorsese[7][a]was born in theFlushingneighborhood of New York City's Queens borough on November 17, 1942.[9][10]He grew up in theLittle Italyneighborhood of the city's Manhattan borough.[11]Both of his parents,Catherine Scorsese(née Cappa) andCharles Scorsese, worked in theGarment District. Charles was a clothes presser and actor, while Catherine was a seamstress and an actress.[12]All four of Scorsese's grandparents were Italian immigrants fromSicily, hailing fromPolizzi Generosaon his father's side andCiminnaon his mother's side.[13][14]The original surname of the family was Scozzese, meaning "Scot" or "Scottish" in Italian, and was later changed to Scorsese because of a transcription error.[15][16][17]
Scorsese was raised in a predominantlyCatholicenvironment.[9]As a boy, he hadasthmaand could not play sports or take part in any activities with other children, so his parents and his older brother would often take him to movie theaters; it was at this stage in his life that he developed a passion for cinema. He has spoken of the influence ofPowell and Pressburger'sBlack Narcissus(1947) andThe Red Shoes(1948).[18]As a teenager inthe Bronx, he frequently rented Powell and Pressburger'sThe Tales of Hoffmann(1951) from a store that had one copy of the reel. He was one of only two people who regularly rented it; the other,George A. Romero, also became a director.[19]
Scorsese has namedSabuandVictor Matureas his favorite actors in his youth. He recalls his father taking him to seeJean Renoir'sThe River(1951) and being fascinated by its depiction ofIndia. He became "obsessed" with Renoir'sLa Grande Illusion(1937) when it was rereleased.[20]He namesJohn Ford'sThe Quiet Man(1952) andThe Searchers(1956) as formative influences.[21]In a documentary onItalian neorealism, he commented on howRoberto Rossellini'sRome, Open City(1945) andVittorio De Sica'sBicycle Thieves(1946) inspired him and influenced his view of his Sicilian roots. In his documentaryIl Mio Viaggio in Italia(My Voyage to Italy), Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of  Rossellini'sPaisà(1946), which he first saw on television with his relatives who were themselves Sicilian immigrants, had a significant impact on his life.[22]He remembers responding "very strongly" toAlfred Hitchcock'sVertigo(1958).[23]He acknowledges owing a great debt to theFrench New Waveand has stated that "the French New Wave has influenced all filmmakers who have worked since, whether they saw the films or not."[24]He has also cited the works ofSatyajit Ray,[22]Ingmar Bergman,[25][26]Andrzej Wajda,[27]Michelangelo Antonioni,[28]Federico Fellini,[29]Ishirō HondaandEiji Tsuburaya[30]as major influences on his career. Although there was no habit of reading at home, towards the end of the 1950s, Scorsese began to approach literature, being marked in particular byFyodor Dostoevsky'sNotes from Underground(1864),James Joyce'sA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man(1916) andGraham Greene'sThe Heart of the Matter(1948).[31]
Scorsese attended the all-boysCardinal Hayes High Schoolin the Bronx, graduating in 1960.[32]He had initially desired to become apriest, attending a preparatoryseminary, but failed after the first year and was unable to attendFordham University.[33][34]This gave way to cinema and consequently Scorsese enrolled inNew York University'sWashington Square College(now known as theCollege of Arts and Science), where he earned a bachelor's degree in English in 1964.[32][35]He went on to earn his Master of Arts from NYU's School of Education (now theSteinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development) in 1968,[36][37]a year after the school was founded.[38]
While attending the Tisch School of the Arts, Scorsese made the short filmsWhat's a Nice Girl like You Doing in a Place like This?(1963) andIt's Not Just You, Murray!(1964). His most famous short of the period is the darkly comicThe Big Shave(1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement inVietnam, suggested by its alternative titleViet '67.[39]Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by film professorHaig P. Manoogian.[40]Scorsese's first professional job was when he was at NYU he was the assistant cameraman to cinematographerBaird Bryanton theJohn G. Avildsendirected short filmSmiles(1964). Scorsese stated: "It was really important because they were filming on 35mm". He stated he was terrible at the job because he could not judge the distance of the focus. He also worked as agafferforAlbert and David Mayslesand as an editor forCBS News, the later of whom offered him a full time position, but Scorsese declined due to his pursuit in film.[41]
In 1967, Scorsese made his first feature-length film, the black and whiteI Call First, later retitledWho's That Knocking at My Door, with his fellow students actorHarvey Keiteland editorThelma Schoonmaker, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators.Roger Ebertsaw the film at the 1967Chicago International Film Festivaland wrote, in Scorsese's first published review: "it brings together two opposing worlds of American cinema. On the one hand, there have been traditional films likeMarty,View from the Bridge,On the WaterfrontandDavid and Lisa-- all sincere attempts to function at the level where real lives are led and all suffering to some degree from their makers' romantic and idealistic ideas, about such lives. On the other hand, there have been experimental films fromJonas Mekas,Shirley Clarkeand other pioneers of the New York underground. InThe Connection,ShadowsandGuns of the Trees, they used improvised dialog and scenes and hidden and hand-held cameras in an attempt to capture the freshness of a spontaneous experience ...I Call Firstbrings these two kinds of films together into a work that is absolutely genuine, artistically satisfying and technically comparable to the best films being made anywhere. I have no reservations in describing it as a great moment in American movies."[42]
Scorsese became friends with the influential "movie brats" of the 1970s:Brian De Palma,Francis Ford Coppola,George LucasandSteven Spielberg.[43][44]It was De Palma who introduced Scorsese toRobert De Niro.[43]During this period, Scorsese worked as the assistant director and one of the editors onMichael Wadleigh's documentaryWoodstock(1970) and met actor–directorJohn Cassavetes, who became a close friend and mentor.[45]
Scorsese metRoger Cormanafter coming to Hollywood to editMedicine Ball Caravanand Corman, who had seen and likedWho's That Knocking at My Door, asked Scorsese to make a sequel toBloody Mama(1970). This came to beBoxcar Bertha(1972).[46][45]It was Corman who taught Scorsese that entertaining films could be shot with very little money or time, preparing the young director well for the challenges to come. Following the film's release, Cassavetes encouraged Scorsese to make the films that he wanted to make, rather than someone else's projects.
Mean Streetswas a breakthrough for Scorsese, Keitel andRobert De Niro.Pauline Kaelwrote: "Martin Scorsese'sMean Streetsis a true original of our time, a triumph of personal filmmaking. It has its own hallucinatory look; the characters live in the darkness of bars, with lighting and color just this shade of lurid ... It's about American life here and now, and it doesn't look like an American movie, or feel like one. If it were subtitled, we could hail a new European or South American talent — a newBuñuelsteeped inVerdi, perhaps."[47]By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though the majority ofMean Streetswas shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing, and a soundtrack with contemporary music. Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style, and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to Cassavetes,Samuel Fullerand earlyJean-Luc Godard.[48]In 1974, actressEllen Burstynchose Scorsese to direct her inAlice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Although well regarded, the film remains an anomaly in Scorsese's early career as it focuses on a central female character. Returning to Little Italy to explore his ethnic roots, Scorsese directedItalianamerican(1974), a documentary featuring his parents Charles and Catherine Scorsese.
Scorsese followed withTaxi Driverin 1976, which depicted aVietnamveteran who takes the law into his own hands on New York's crime-ridden streets.[49]The film established him as an accomplished filmmaker and also brought attention to cinematographerMichael Chapman, whose style tends towards high contrasts, strong colors, and complex camera movements. The film starred De Niro as the angry and alienatedTravis Bickle, and co-starredJodie Fosterin a highly controversial role as an underage prostitute, with Harvey Keitel as her pimp.[50]Taxi Driveralso marked the start of a series of collaborations between Scorsese and writerPaul Schrader, whose influences included the diary of would-be assassinArthur Bremer,John Ford'sThe Searchers(1956), andRobert Bresson'sPickpocket(1959).[51]Already controversial upon its release,Taxi Driverhit the headlines again five years later, whenJohn Hinckley Jr.made an assassination attempt on then-presidentRonald Reagan. He subsequently blamed his act on his obsession with Jodie Foster'sTaxi Drivercharacter (in the film, De Niro's character, Travis Bickle, makes an assassination attempt on a senator).[52]
Taxi Driverwon thePalme d'Orat the 1976 Cannes Film Festival,[53]also receiving fourOscarnominations, includingBest Picture. The critical and financial success ofTaxi Driverencouraged Scorsese to move ahead with his first big-budget project: the highly stylized musicalNew York, New York. This tribute to Scorsese's home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure. The film was the director's third collaboration with De Niro, co-starring withLiza Minnelli. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized byFrank Sinatra. Although possessing Scorsese's usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work. Despite its weak reception, the film is regarded positively by some critics.Richard Brodywrote:
For Scorsese, a lifelong cinephile, the essence of New York could be found in its depiction in classic Hollywood movies. Remarkably, his backward-looking tribute to the golden age of musicals and noirish romantic melodramas turned out to be one of his most freewheeling and personal films.[54]
In 1977, he directed the Broadway musicalThe Act, starring Minnelli.[55]The disappointing reception ofNew York, New Yorkdrove Scorsese into depression. By this stage Scorsese had developed a seriouscocaineaddiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regardedThe Last Waltz, documenting the final concert byThe Band. It was held at theWinterland Ballroomin San Francisco onThanksgiving Day, 1976, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, includingBob Dylan,Neil Young,Ringo Starr,Muddy Waters,Joni Mitchell,Van Morrison,Paul Butterfield,Neil Diamond,Ronnie WoodandEric Clapton. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978. Another Scorsese-directed documentary, titledAmerican Boy, also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared inTaxi Driver. A period of wild partying followed, damaging Scorsese's already fragile health. Scorsese helped provide footage for the documentaryElvis on Tour.
By several accounts (Scorsese's included), De Niro saved Scorsese's life when he persuaded him to kick hiscocaineaddiction to make his highly regarded filmRaging Bull.Mark Singersummarized Scorsese's condition:
He (Scorsese) was more than mildly depressed. Drug abuse, and abuse of his body in general, culminated in a terrifying episode of internal bleeding. Robert De Niro came to see him in the hospital and asked, in so many words, whether he wanted to live or die. If you want to live, De Niro proposed, let's make this picture—referring toRaging Bull, an as-told-to book by Jake LaMotta, the former world middleweight boxing champion, that De Niro had given him to read years earlier.[56]
Convinced that he would never make another movie, he poured his energies into making the violent biopic of middleweight boxing championJake LaMotta, calling it akamikazemethod of film-making.[57]The film is widely viewed as a masterpiece and was voted the greatest film of the 1980s by Britain'sSight & Soundmagazine.[58][59]It received eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture,Best Actorfor De Niro,Best Supporting ActressforCathy Moriarty,Best Supporting ActorforJoe Pesciand Scorsese's first forBest Director. De Niro won, as did Thelma Schoonmaker for editing, but Best Director went toRobert RedfordforOrdinary People. From this work onwards, Scorsese's films are always labeled as "A Martin Scorsese Picture" on promotional material.Raging Bull, filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese's style reached its zenith:Taxi DriverandNew York, New Yorkhad used elements ofexpressionismto replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensiveslow-motion, complextracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight).[60]Thematically too, the concerns carried on fromMean StreetsandTaxi Driver: insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.
Although the screenplay forRaging Bullwas credited to Paul Schrader andMardik Martin(who earlier co-wroteMean Streets), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft. It was rewritten several times by various writers includingJay Cocks. The final draft was largely written by Scorsese and De Niro.[61]In 1997, theAmerican Film InstituterankedRaging Bullas the twenty-fourth greatest American film of all time on theirAFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movieslist. In 2007, they rankedRaging Bullas the fourth American greatest film on theirAFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)list.
Scorsese's next project was his fifth collaboration with De Niro,The King of Comedy(1982). It is asatireon the world of media and celebrity, whose central character is a troubledlonerwho ironically becomes famous through a criminal act (kidnapping).[62]The film was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with. Visually, it was far less kinetic than the style Scorsese had developed previously, often using a static camera and long takes.[63]Here the expressionism of his previous work gave way to moments of almost totalsurrealism. It still bore many of Scorsese's trademarks, however.TheKing of Comedyfailed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release. German directorWim Wendersnumbered it among his 15 favorite films.[64]In 1983, Scorsese made a briefcameo appearanceinAnna Pavlova(also known asA Woman for All Time), originally intended to be directed by one of his heroes,Michael Powell. This led to a more significant acting appearance inBertrand Tavernier'sjazzfilmRound Midnight. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode ofSteven Spielberg'sAmazing Stories.
WithAfter Hours(1985), for which he won aBest Director Awardat Cannes, Scorsese made an esthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost "underground" film-making style. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in theSoHoneighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor (Griffin Dunne) and features cameos by such disparate actors asTeri GarrandCheech & Chong. Along with the 1987Michael Jacksonmusic video "Bad", in 1986 Scorsese madeThe Color of Money, a sequel toRobert Rossen'sThe Hustler(1961) withPaul Newman, which co-starredTom Cruise. Although adhering to Scorsese's established style,The Color of Moneywas Scorsese's first official foray into mainstream film-making. The film finally won Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him:The Last Temptation of Christ.
In 1983, Scorsese began work on this long-cherished personal project.The Last Temptation of Christ, based on the1955 novelbyNikos Kazantzakis, retold the life ofChristin human rather than divine terms.Barbara Hersheyrecalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filmingBoxcar Bertha.[65]The film was slated to shoot under theParamount Picturesbanner, but shortly before principal photography was to start, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version,Aidan Quinnwas cast as Jesus, andStingwas cast asPontius Pilate. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played byWillem DafoeandDavid Bowierespectively.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project;Universal Picturesagreed to finance the film as Scorsese agreed to make a more mainstream film for the studio in the future (it eventually resulted inCape Fear).[66]Even prior to its 1988 release, the film (adapted byTaxi DriverandRaging Bullveteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceivedblasphemyeffectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation.[67]Most of the controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family withMary Magdalenein aSatan-inducedhallucinationwhile on the cross.
In 1986, Scorsese directed the 18-minute short filmBadfeaturingMichael JacksonandWesley Snipes(in his film debut). The short also serves as amusic videoand was shot in theHoyt–Schermerhorn Streets stationinBrooklynover a 6-week period during November and December 1986. Chapman was the film's cinematographer. The direction and choreography were heavily influenced byWest Side Story(1961). Scorsese also noted the influence ofTaxi DriverinSpike Lee's documentaryBad 25(2012).[68]The short has been praised by critics as one of the greatest and most iconic videos of all time.[69][70][71]That year, he had signed a deal with upstart majorThe Walt Disney Studiosto produce and direct features, following the success ofThe Color of Money.[72]
Looking past the controversy,The Last Temptation of Christgained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. He received his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing toBarry LevinsonforRain Man). Scorsese directed "Life Lessons", one of three segments in the anthology filmNew York Stories(1989). Ebert gave the film a mixed review, while praising Scorsese's short as "really successful".[73]
After a decade of films considered by critics to be mixed results, some considered Scorsese's gangster epicGoodfellas(1990) his return to directorial form, and his most confident and fully realized film sinceRaging Bull. De Niro andJoe Pescioffered a virtuoso display of Scorsese's bravura cinematic technique in the film and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released,Roger Ebert, a friend and supporter of Scorsese, namedGoodfellas"the best mob movie ever". It is ranked No. 1 on Ebert's movie list for 1990, along with those ofGene SiskelandPeter Travers', and is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements.[74][75][76]The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination but again lost to a first-time director,Kevin Costner(Dances with Wolves). Joe Pesci earned theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actorfor his performance. Scorsese and the film also won many other awards, including fiveBAFTAAwards, aSilver Lionand more. The American Film Institute placedGoodfellasat No. 94 on the AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. On the 2007 updated version, they movedGoodfellasup to No. 92 on the AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition) and putGoodfellasat No. 2 ontheir list of the top 10 gangster films(afterThe Godfather).
In 1990, he released his only short-form documentary:Made in Milanabout fashion designerGiorgio Armani. The following year broughtCape Fear, a remake of a cult1962 movieof the same name and the director's seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily fromAlfred HitchcockandCharles Laughton'sThe Night of the Hunter(1955).Cape Fearreceived a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depictingmisogynisticviolence. However, the lurid subject matter gave Scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it stood as Scorsese's most commercially successful release untilThe Aviator(2004), and thenThe Departed(2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.39:1.
In 1990, Scorsese acted in a small role asVincent van Goghin the filmDreamsby Japanese directorAkira Kurosawa. Scorsese's 1994 cameo appearance in theRobert RedfordfilmQuiz Showis remembered for the telling line: "You see, the audience didn't tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability. They just wanted to watch the money."
In 1994, Scorsese and producer Barbara De Fina formed the production company 
De Fina-Cappa.[77]In the early 1990s, Scorsese also expanded his role as a film producer. He produced a wide range of films, including major Hollywood studio productions (Mad Dog and Glory,Clockers), low-budget independent films (The Grifters,Naked in New York,Grace of My Heart,Search and Destroy,The Hi-Lo Country), and even the foreign film (Con gli occhi chiusi(With Closed Eyes)).
The Age of Innocence(1993) was a significant departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of theEdith Whartonnovelabout the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon its original release but was abox office bomb, making an overall loss. As noted inScorsese on Scorseseby editor–interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.
Scorsese was interested in doing a "romantic piece", and he was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text. Scorsese wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this end, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that had had an emotional impact on him. InScorsese on Scorsese, he documents influences from films such asLuchino Visconti'sSensoand hisIl Gattopardo(The Leopard) as well asOrson Welles'sThe Magnificent Ambersonsand also Roberto Rossellini'sLa prise de pouvoir par Louis XIV(The Taking of Power by Louis XIV). AlthoughThe Age of Innocencewas ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including Best Adapted Screenplay for Scorsese), winning the Costume Design Oscar. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award-winning actorDaniel Day-Lewis, with whom he would work again onGangs of New York. This was Scorsese's first film to be shot on Super 35 format.
Casino(1995), likeThe Age of Innocencebefore it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to the director's fans who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film.Casinowas a box office success,[78]and it received generally positive notices from critics. Comparisons were drawn to his earlier filmGoodfellas, and Scorsese admittedCasinobore a superficial resemblance to it, but he maintained that the story was significantly larger in scope.[79]Sharon Stonewas nominated for theBest Actress Academy Awardfor her performance. During the filming, Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.
Scorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995, titledA Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies, offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career. He said, "I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries." In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as (1) the director as storyteller; (2) the director as an illusionist: D. W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; (3) the director as a smuggler—filmmakers such asDouglas Sirk, Samuel Fuller, andVincente Minnelli, who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and (4) the director as iconoclast. In the preface to this documentary, Scorsese states his commitment to the "Director's Dilemma", in which a successful contemporary director must be pragmatic about the realities of getting financing for films of personal esthetic interest by accepting the need of "making one film for the studio, and (then) making one for oneself."
IfThe Age of Innocencealienated and confused some fans, thenKundun(1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life ofTenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, thePeople's Liberation Army's entry intoTibet, and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not only a departure in subject matter,Kundunsaw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaboratetableauof colorful visual images.[80]The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor,Buena Vista Pictures, which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurtingKundun's commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it appearsKundunhas been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour.Kundunwas Scorsese's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, followingThe Last Temptation of Christ.
Bringing Out the Dead(1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlierTaxi Driver.[81]Like earlier Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recall the films of Robert Bresson.[82](It is also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent ofAfter Hours.) It received generally positive reviews,[83]although not the universal critical acclaim of some of his other films. It starsNicolas Cage,Ving Rhames,John Goodman,Tom Sizemore, andPatricia Arquette.
On various occasions Scorsese has been asked to present theHonorary Academy Awardduring the Oscar telecast. In 1998, at the70th Academy Awards, Scorsese presented the award to film legendStanley Donen. When accepting the award Donen quipped, "Marty this is backwards, I should be giving this to you, believe me".[84]In 1999, at the71st Academy Awards, Scorsese and De Niro presented the award to film directorElia Kazan. This was a controversial pick for the academy due to Kazan's involvement with theHollywood blacklistin the 1950s.[85]Several members of the audience includingNick NolteandEd Harrisrefused to applaud Kazan when he received the award while others such asWarren Beatty,Meryl Streep,Kathy Bates, andKurt Russellgave him a standing ovation.[86][87]
In 1999, Scorsese directed a documentary on Italian filmmakers titledIl Mio Viaggio in Italia, also known asMy Voyage to Italy. The documentary foreshadowed Scorsese's next project, the epicGangs of New York(2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famousCinecittàfilm studios. With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million,Gangs of New Yorkwas Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. LikeThe Age of Innocence, it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actorLeonardo DiCaprio, who became a fixture in later Scorsese films. The production was highly troubled, with many rumors referring to the director's conflict withMiramax FilmsbossHarvey Weinstein.[88]Despite denials of artistic compromise, some felt that it was Scorsese's most conventional film, featuring standard film tropes that Scorsese had traditionally avoided, such as characters existing purely forexpositionpurposes and explanatoryflashbacks.[89][90][91]
The final cut of the movie ran to 168 minutes, while Scorsese's original cut was over 180 minutes long.[89]Even so, the film received generally positive reviews with the review aggregatorRotten Tomatoesreporting that 75 percent of the reviews for the film they tallied were positive and summarizing the critics writing, "Though flawed, the sprawling, messyGangs of New Yorkis redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis's electrifying performance."[92]The film's central themes are consistent with Scorsese's established concerns: New York, violence as culturally endemic, and subcultural divisions down ethnic lines. Originally filmed for a release in the winter of 2001 (to qualify for Academy Award nominations), Scorsese delayed the final production of the film until after the beginning of 2002; Miramax Films consequently delayed the film until its release in theOscar seasonof late 2002.[93]Gangs of New Yorkearned Scorsese his first Golden Globe for Best Director. In February 2003,Gangs of New Yorkreceived 10 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis; however, it did not win in any category.
The following year, Scorsese completed production ofThe Blues, an expansive seven-part documentary tracing the history of blues music from its African roots to the Mississippi Delta and beyond. Seven filmmakers including Wim Wenders,Clint Eastwood,Mike Figgis, and Scorsese himself each contributed a 90-minute film (Scorsese's entry was titledFeel Like Going Home). In the early 2000s, Scorsese produced several films for up-and-coming directors, such asYou Can Count on Me(directed byKenneth Lonergan),Rain(directed by Katherine Lindberg),Lymelife(directed byDerick Martini) andThe Young Victoria(directed byJean-Marc Vallée). At that time, he establishedSikelia Productions.[94]In 2003, producerEmma Tillinger Koskoffjoined the company.[95]Scorsese also produced several documentaries, such asThe Soul of a Man(directed by Wim Wenders) andLightning in a Bottle(directed byAntoine Fuqua).
Scorsese's filmThe Aviator(2004) is a lavish, large-scalebiopicof eccentric aviation pioneer and film mogulHoward Hughesand reunited Scorsese with actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The film received highly positive reviews.[96][97][98][99][100]The film was a widespread box office success and gained Academy recognition.The Aviatorwas nominated for sixGolden Globe Awards, includingBest Motion Picture-Drama,Best Director,Best Screenplay, andBest Actor-Motion Picture Dramafor Leonardo DiCaprio. It won three, including Best Motion Picture-Drama and Best Actor-Motion Picture Drama. In January 2005The Aviatorbecame the most-nominated film of the77th Academy Awardsnominations, nominated in 11 categories including Best Picture. The film also garnered nominations in nearly all the other major categories, including a fifth Best Director nomination for Scorsese. Despite having the most nominations, the film won only five Oscars. Scorsese lost again, this time to director Clint Eastwood forMillion Dollar Baby(which also won Best Picture).
No Direction Homeis a documentary film by Scorsese that tells of the life of Bob Dylan, and his impact on American popular music and the culture of the 20th century. The film does not cover Dylan's entire career; it focuses on his beginnings, his rise to fame in the 1960s, his then-controversial transformationfrom an acoustic guitar-based musician and performer to an electric guitar-influenced sound and his "retirement" from touring in 1966 following an infamous motorcycle accident. The film was first presented on television in both the United States (as part of thePBSAmerican Mastersseries) and the United Kingdom (as part of theBBC TwoArenaseries) on September 26 to 27, 2005. A DVD version of the film was released the same month. The film won aPeabody Awardand theGrammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video. In addition, Scorsese received aPrimetime Emmy Awardnomination forOutstanding Directing for a Documentary/Nonfiction Program, losing toBaghdad ER.
Scorsese returned to the crime genre with the Boston-set thrillerThe Departed, based on the Hong Kong police dramaInfernal Affairs(which is co-directed byAndrew LauandAlan Mak). The film continued Scorsese's collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio and was the first time he worked withMatt Damon,Jack Nicholson,Mark Wahlberg, andMartin Sheen.The Departedopened to widespread critical acclaim, with some proclaiming it as one of the best efforts Scorsese had brought to the screen since 1990'sGoodfellas,[101][102]and still others putting it at the same level as Scorsese's most celebrated classicsTaxi DriverandRaging Bull.[103][104]With domestic box office receipts surpassingUS$129.4million,The Departedwas Scorsese's highest-grossing film (not accounting for inflation) until 2010'sShutter Island.The Departedearned Scorsese a second Golden Globe for Best Director, as well as a Critics' Choice Award, his firstDirectors Guild of AmericaAward, and the Academy Award for Best Director. Presented with the latter, Scorsese poked fun at his track record of nominations, asking, "Could you double-check the envelope?"[105]The award was presented by his longtime friends and colleaguesFrancis Ford Coppola,George LucasandSteven Spielberg.The Departedalso received the Academy Award for the Best Motion Picture of 2006, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing by longtime Scorsese editor Thelma Schoonmaker, her third win for a Scorsese film.

In 2009, Scorsese signed a petition in support of directorRoman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown "freely and safely", and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door "for actions of which no-one can know the effects."[107][108]

Several recurring filmmaking techniques are identifiable in many of Scorsese's films. He has established a filmmaking history which involves repeat collaborations with actors, screenwriters, film editors, and cinematographers, sometimes extending over several decades, such as that with recurring cinematographersMichael Ballhaus,Robert Richardson, andRodrigo Prieto.
Scorsese is known for his frequent use ofslow motion, for example, inWho's That Knocking at My Door(1967) andMean Streets(1973).[178]He is also known for usingfreeze frames, such as: in the opening credits ofThe King of Comedy(1983), throughoutGoodfellas(1990),Casino(1995),The Departed(2006), and inThe Irishman(2019). His blonde leading ladies are usually seen through the eyes of the protagonist as angelic and ethereal; they wear white in their first scene and are photographed in slow motion—Cybill ShepherdinTaxi Driver;Cathy Moriarty's white bikini inRaging Bull; Sharon Stone's white minidress inCasino.[179]This may be a nod to director Alfred Hitchcock.[180]Scorsese often uses long tracking shots,[181]as seen inTaxi Driver,Goodfellas,Casino,Gangs of New York, andHugo.MOSsequences set to popular music or voice-over are regularly seen in his films, often involving aggressive camera movement or rapid editing.[182]Scorsese sometimes highlights characters in a scene with an iris, an homage to 1920ssilent filmcinema (as scenes at the time sometimes used this transition). This effect can be seen inCasino(it is used on Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci),Life Lessons,The Departed(on Matt Damon), andHugo. Some of his films include references/allusions to Westerns, particularlyRio Bravo,The Great Train Robbery,Shane,The Searchers, andThe Oklahoma Kid. Slow motion flashbulbs and accented camera/flash/shutter sounds are often used, as is the song "Gimme Shelter" by The Rolling Stones heard in several of Scorsese's films:Goodfellas,Casino, andThe Departed.
Scorsese usually has a quick cameo in his films (Who's That Knocking at My Door,Boxcar Bertha,Mean Streets,Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,Taxi Driver,The King of Comedy,After Hours,The Last Temptation of Christ(albeit hidden under a hood),The Age of Innocence,Gangs of New York,Hugo,Killers of the Flower Moon), he is also known to contribute his voice to a film without appearing on screen (e.g. as inThe AviatorandThe Wolf of Wall Street). InThe Age of Innocence, for example, he appears in the non-speaking role of alarge formatportrait photographer in one of the passing scenes of the film. He provides the opening voice-over narration inMean StreetsandThe Color of Money; plays the off-screen dressing room attendant in the final scene ofRaging Bull, and provides the voice of the unseen ambulance dispatcher inBringing Out the Dead.[183]He also appears as the director of fictional newly formed Vatican Television in the Italian comedyIn the Pope's Eye.
Guilt is a prominent theme in many of his films, as is the role ofCatholicismin creating and dealing withguilt(Who's That Knocking at My Door,Mean Streets,Raging Bull,Bringing Out the Dead,The Departed,Shutter Island, andThe Irishman). In a similar manner, Scorsese consideredSilencea "passion project": it had been in development since 1990, two years after the release of his filmThe Last Temptation of Christ, which also contained strongly religious themes.[184]When asked why he retained interest in a project dealing with strong theological themes for over 26 years, Scorsese said,
As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people in my life and my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there's got to be more ...Silenceis just something that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, it has to be done ... it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions.[185]
More recently, his films have featured corrupt authority figures, such as policemen inThe Departed[186]and politicians inGangs of New York[187]andThe Aviator.[188]He is also known for his liberal usage of profanity,dark humor, and violence.[189]
Scorsese's interest in political corruption as depicted in his films was expanded further in his 2019 filmThe Irishman.Richard Brodywriting forThe New Yorkerfound the main interpretation of the film to be a dark allegory of a realist reading of American politics and American society stating:
The real-life Hoffa... (was) a crucial player in both gangland politics and the actual practical politics of the day, and the movie's key through line is the inseparability of those two realms.The Irishmanis a sociopolitical horror story that views much of modern American history as a continuous crime in motion, in which every level of society—from domestic life through local business through big business through national and international politics—is poisoned by graft and bribery, shady deals and dirty money, threats of violence and its gruesome enactment, and the hard-baked impunity that keeps the entire system running.[190]
Scorsese often casts the same actors in his projects, particularly Robert De Niro, who has collaborated with Scorsese on ten feature films and one short film. Included are the three films (Taxi Driver,Raging Bull, andGoodfellas) that made AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. Scorsese has often said he thinks De Niro's best work under his direction was Rupert Pupkin inThe King of Comedy. After the turn of the century, Scorsese found a new muse with younger actor Leonardo DiCaprio, collaborating on six feature films and one short to date.[191]Several critics have compared Scorsese's new partnership with DiCaprio with his previous one with De Niro.[192][193]Frequent collaborators also include:Victor Argo(6), Harvey Keitel (6),Harry Northup(6),J. C. MacKenzie(5), Murray Moston (5),Illeana Douglas(4), Joe Pesci (4),Frank Vincent(3),Barry Primus(3), andVerna Bloom(3). Others who have appeared in multiple Scorsese projects include Daniel Day-Lewis, who had become very reclusive to the Hollywood scene,Alec Baldwin, Willem Dafoe, Ben Kingsley, Jude Law,Dick Miller, Liam Neeson, Emily Mortimer,Jesse Plemons,John C. Reilly,David Carradine, Barbara Hershey,Kevin Corrigan,Jake Hoffman,Frank Sivero,Ray WinstoneandNick Nolte. Before their deaths, Scorsese's parents, Charles Scorsese andCatherine Scorsese, appeared in bit parts, walk-ons or supporting roles, such as inGoodfellas.[194]
For his crew, Scorsese frequently worked with editorsMarcia Lucas[195]and Thelma Schoonmaker,[196]cinematographersMichael Ballhaus,[197]Robert Richardson, Michael Chapman andRodrigo Prieto, screenwriters Paul Schrader, Mardik Martin, Jay Cocks, Terrence Winter,John LoganandSteven Zaillian, costume designerSandy Powell, production designersDante Ferrettiand Bob Shaw, music producerRobbie Robertson, and composersHoward Shore[198]andElmer Bernstein.[199]Schoonmaker, Richardson, Powell, and Ferretti have each won Academy Awards in their respective categories on collaborations with Scorsese. Elaine andSaul Bass, the latter being Hitchcock's frequent title designer, designed the opening credits forGoodfellas,The Age of Innocence,CasinoandCape Fear.

He is ofItaliandescent with family origins both inTurin[1][2][3]andAquiloniain theprovince of Avellino.[4]Pesci was raised inBelleville, New Jersey, and graduated fromBelleville High School.
By the time Pesci was five years old he was appearing in plays in New York.[1]At age 10 he was a regular on a television variety show calledStartime Kids, which also featuredConnie Francis.[1]As an entertainer from Belleville, he was acquainted with guitaristTommy DeVitoofThe Four Lovers, a novelty act from Belleville that included singerFrankie Valli; Pesci also knew keyboardistBob GaudioofThe Royal Teens. Pesci introduced Gaudio to DeVito and Valli in 1958, which led to the formation of the bandThe Four Seasons.[5]Pesci and DeVito remained friends for the rest of DeVito's life; when DeVito fell on hard times in the 1970s following his resignation from the Four Seasons, Pesci placed DeVito on his personal payroll, and Pesci arranged for DeVito to make cameos in some of Pesci's 1990s films.[6]
Pesci was childhood friends withAmerican Mafiafigure Robert Bisaccia.[7]
In the 1960s, Pesci began working as a barber, following in his mother's footsteps. At the same time, he tried to start a musical career, playing guitar with several bands, includingJoey Dee and the Starliterswho introduced the "Peppermint Twist" record, dance, and Peppermint Lounge in New York City.
In 1968, he released his debut albumLittle Joe Sure Can Sing!(billed asJoe Ritchie), on which he sang covers of contemporary pop hits.[8]
Pesci later joinedFrank Vincentas acomedy duo, performing as "Vincent and Pesci" from 1970 to 1976. Their act coupledAbbott and Costello-inspired double act antics withDon Rickles-styleinsult comedy, which proved popular with crowds. During this time, the pair developed a strong professional and personal friendship.[9][10]In 1975, they appeared in the Broadway showThe New Vaudevillians, which only lasted one week.[8]
The first film Pesci starred in was the 1976low-budgetcrime filmThe Death Collectoralongside Frank Vincent. After the film Pesci returned to The Bronx and lived above Amici's Restaurant, where he was an employee.[8]
In 1979, Pesci received a phone  call fromMartin Scorseseand Robert De Niro, who were impressed with his performance inThe Death Collectorand asked him to co-star in Scorsese'sRaging BullasJoey LaMotta. During the course of filming Pesci broke one of his ribs.[11]
Pesci won theBAFTA Film Award for Newcomer to Leading Film Rolesin 1981 and was nominated for anAcademy Awardfor Best Supporting Actor. Over the next few years, Pesci appeared in several smaller films, includingDear Mr. Wonderful(1982),Eureka(1983) andEasy Money(1983).[8]
In 1984, he was cast inOnce Upon a Time in America, again appearing alongside De Niro. The following year he starred as private detective Rocky Nelson in the short-lived television comedy seriesHalf Nelson.[8]
In 1988, Pesci appeared in theMichael Jacksonmusical anthology filmMoonwalker, in the film's sixth and longest segment, "Smooth Criminal". He played the antagonist, crime boss Frankie "Mr. Big" LiDeo (an anagram for one of the film's producers and longtime Jackson managerFrank DiLeo,[12]with whom Pesci later acted inGoodfellas).[13]

In 1990, he reunited with Scorsese and De Niro forGoodfellas, in which he played mobster Tommy DeVito, based on real-life mobsterThomas DeSimone. Tommy DeVito was also the name of Pesci's old acquaintance from Belleville, New Jersey, and a member of The Four Seasons, but contrary to popular belief, the naming is coincidental.[5]Pesci's old friendFrank Vincentalso appears in the film. Pesci's character kills Vincent's character in a rage in one of the best-remembered scenes in the film after the Vincent character contemptuously tells him to "go home and get your fucking shine box". According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals, where Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors came up with that he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography.[14]
For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him—the "Funny how? Do I amuse you?" scene—is based on an actual event that Pesci experienced. He was waiting tables when he thought he made a compliment to a mobster by saying he was "funny", which was not taken well.[15][16]It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised, and Scorsese recorded four to five takes, rewrote their dialogue, and inserted it into the script.[17]The dinner scene with Tommy's mother was largely improvised.[18]Pesci received theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actorfor the role, which he accepted with one of the shortest speeches in Oscar history, saying simply, "It's my privilege. Thank you" before leaving the stage.[13][19]
Pesci also co-starred in the blockbusterHome Alonein 1990, his character Harry Lime one of two bumbling burglars - along withDaniel Sternas Marv Murchins - who attempt to burgle the house of an eight-year-old played byMacaulay Culkin.

In 1991, Pesci playedDavid FerrieinJFK. In 1992, he appeared as the title character in the comedyMy Cousin VinnywithRalph Macchio,Marisa TomeiandFred Gwynne. During the same year Pesci headed up the cast ofThe Public Eyeas Leon "Bernzy" Bernstein, a photographer. His performance in the film, a departure from his usual characters, has been critically acclaimed.
Pesci hosted the sketch comedy showSaturday Night Liveon October 10, 1992, while doing publicity forMy Cousin Vinny. During his monologue, in response toSinéad O'Connortearing a picture ofPope John Paul IIon the previous broadcast in protest of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, he described how he wished to give her "such a smack".[21]
In 1993, Pesci made an appearance inA Bronx Taleas Carmine. The film starred Robert De Niro, who also directed, andChazz Palminteri, who wrote the play from which the film was adapted. Both De Niro and Palminteri personally offered Pesci the role.

He had starring roles in several other films, includingMan on Fire(1987),The Super(1991),Jimmy Hollywood(1994),With Honors(also 1994) andGone Fishin'(1997). Pesci's role inWith Honorswas a dramatic role in which he played a homeless man living on the campus of Harvard.
In 1998, he released his second album and his first in 30 years,Vincent LaGuardia Gambini Sings Just for Youwhich was named after his character from the 1992 filmMy Cousin Vinny. The album was both humorous and serious, exploring a variety of genres, though most of it wasbig bandjazz. The album spawned the single "Wise Guy", a rap number that played on thegangstatheme by making reference toMafiagangsterism. "Wise Guy" interpolated the 1980 hit "Rapture" byBlondie, and was co-written and produced by the hip-hop production team theTrackmasters.
In 1999, Pesci announced his retirement from acting to pursue a musical career and to enjoy life away from the camera. He returned to acting when he did acameoin De Niro's 2006 filmThe Good Shepherd. In 2010, he starred in the brothel dramaLove RanchalongsideHelen Mirren.[22]

Pesci appears in the 2016 music documentaryJimmy Scott: I Go Back Home,in which he is filmed recording "The Folks Who Live on the Hill" from Scott's 2017 posthumous albumI Go Back Home.
