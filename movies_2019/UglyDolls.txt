STX Entertainmentis an American independent entertainment and media company. Founded in March 2014 by film producerRobert SimondsandTPG Growthmanaging partnerBill McGlashan, the studio produces film, television, and digital media projects.
In April 2020, STX announced that it would merge with the Indian studioEros International. The merger was completed in July 2020, and STX became a division ofErosSTX. In December 2021,Jahm Najafiannounced his intention to acquire STX from the merged company for $173 million–a sale completed in April 2022. Eros remains a minority, non-voting shareholder.[1]
In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014 (the "S" standing for Simonds, the company's founder; the "T" standing forTPG Growth, whose managing partner McGlashan helped launch the company; and the "X" standing for "secret project"),[2]with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[3][4]Investors in the company includedHony Capital,Tencent,PCCW, TPG Growth,RTL GroupandLiberty Global. Individual investors includeGigi Pritzker,Beau Wrigley, andDominic Ng.[5][6][7]
In September 2017, it was reported that STX was considering aninitial public offeringon theHong Kong Stock Exchange(SEHK). It was reported that a listing on the SEHK could bring STX closer to Chinese investors and audiences.[8]TheWall Street Journalstated that the company could be valued at $3.5 billion, after raising an additional $500 million following the IPO.[8][9]In April 2018, the company filed for an IPO on theHong Kong Stock Exchange.[10]

Clarkson is ofEnglish,Welsh,Irish, andGreekdescent.[7][8]Her mother is a descendant ofRepublicanstate senatorIsaiah Rose(Rose's background was discussed on Clarkson's episode ofWho Do You Think You Are?in 2013).[9]Clarkson was raisedSouthern Baptist.[10]She has said, "I always grew up in church. I was the leader of our youth group. I've always grown up pretty close to church and with God. But I think I've just gotten a lot closer just because He's the only one I can lean on."[11]She later said of her upbringing, "My family was highly conservative; I had to go to church on Sunday and Wednesday."[12]
Clarkson grew up inBurleson, Texasand was educated at Pauline Hughes Middle School. In the seventh grade, the school's choir teacher, Cynthia Glenn, overheard her singing in a hallway and asked her to audition for the school choir. Clarkson told her she had never received any professional vocal training.[13]Clarkson graduated fromBurleson High Schoolin 2000, where she performed in severalmusicals, such asAnnie Get Your Gun,Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, andBrigadoon.[14][15]Clarkson started voice training, hoping to secure a college scholarship in music.[15]
After graduating from high school, Clarkson declined full scholarships to theUniversity of Texas at Austin,University of North Texas, andBerklee College of Music. She declined them saying, "I'd already written so much music and wanted to try on my own... I figured you're never too old to go to college."[16][15]She worked several jobs to finance a demo, recording material and trying to market it to record labels, but she received little response. Clarkson turned down two recording contracts fromJive RecordsandInterscope Records, saying, "They would have completely pigeonholed me as a bubblegum act.[3]I was confident enough that something better would come along."[14]In 2001, she traveled to Los Angeles, pursuing a career in music. She appeared as anextrain a few television series such asSabrina, the Teenage WitchandDharma & Greg,[17]and briefly worked with musicianGerry Goffinto record five demo tracks in an effort to secure a record deal.[18]According to Clarkson, her early attempts to launch her music career floundered when she was turned down by almost every U.S. record label for sounding "too black".[19]Lack of other career opportunities and a fire incident in her apartment forced Clarkson to return to Burleson, where she promoted Red Bull energy drinks, worked as a telemarketer and as a cocktail waitress in a comedy club.[13][20]
Upon returning to Burleson, Clarkson was encouraged by her friends to audition for the inaugural season of the reality television seriesAmerican Idol: The Search for a Superstarin May 2002. Despite receiving a "golden ticket", a pass to the Hollywood rounds, in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first appearance during the second episode. In an interview in 2012, Clarkson referred to the inaugural season as "ghetto", explaining: "On our season we were like kids in camp. Nobody knew what to do. The show was ever changing every day. They did one season ofPop Idolin the UK, but America is a very different market. They dropped us off in a mall and said 'find some clothes to wear on national television'.

I couldn't give a crap about being a star. I've always just wanted to sing and write."[57]The album received positive response, but lack of promotion due to reluctance of RCA led Clarkson to dismiss Kwatinetz andLive Nationto cancel its accompanying tour, theMy December Tour, and reschedule it into a smaller scale with supporting actsJon McLaughlin,Sean KingstonandMandy Moore.[53][58][59]Clarkson later hired talent manager Narvel Blackstock of Starstruck Management.

Critics have said Clarkson has asopranovoice.[176][177][178][179]Arion Berger ofRolling Stonewrote that "her high notes are sweet and pillowy, her growl is bone-shaking and sexy, and her mid-range is amazingly confident."[180]In reviewing a live performance of Clarkson's, Jon Caramanica ofThe New York Timessaid she "showed off a voice that moved in all sorts of ways, without ever appearing to strain", continuing "Ms. Clarkson, who has a malleable voice and a boatload of vocal confidence, might be a soul siren in the making". However, in a separate review ofStronger, Caramanica said Clarkson's voice is "too huge, too violent" for warmer and sweeter vocal stylings, stating "she's on a par withTaylor Swiftwhen it comes to vengeance, and she'll do it louder and with more brutality in comparison to her contemporary."[181][182]In a live review as part of herStronger Tour, Sophie Sinclair ofHit The Floorsaid "Kelly's strong and powerful voice was flawless throughout the night, and some may even say she sounds better live than she does on her albums".[183]Mark Deming fromPhoenix New Timesstated that "in an era when pop music means over-singing a song into a bloody pulp, Clarkson has consistently displayed both charisma and a welcome sense of restraint, knowing how to sound passionate and heartfelt without forgetting where the melody and the root note is supposed to go."[184]
Dr. Luke, who produced some of Clarkson's hits, said "She has powerful lungs. She's like theLance Armstrongof vocal cords."[185]In an interview withGood Morning America,Simon Cowellwas asked of the then sixAmerican Idolwinners, who he thought had the best voice. Cowell immediately answered that Clarkson did "by a mile", noting that she was "up there" with other great singers such asCeline Dion.[186]Esquirewrote that Clarkson has "the best voice in the history of pop music".[187]ReviewingStronger, Jody Rosen ofRolling Stonestates, Clarkson has "one of music's most remarkable voices."[188]Jason Lipshutz fromBillboardconsidered Clarkson as one of the greatest singers in pop music.[189]Regarding the controversial practice oflip-syncing, Clarkson says she never has and never will lip-sync, elaborating in an interview with Cory Myers, "I've actually never done that because I'm terrified; if I ever did that, something horrible would happen, the track would skip. I have a really unhealthy fear about it. So no, I've never done that".[190]Clarkson has earned the title "Queen of Covers" for her ability to perform songs from artists of various genres.[191]
At age eight, Clarkson was first inspired to venture into music during a visit to anAfrican-American churchinFort Worth, Texas. She recalled: "I was like, 'Wow, whatever they're feeling, I want to feel it too'."[192]Clarkson has been influenced by musicians across various genres. She cited soul singerAretha Franklinas her major influence. Many of her chosenIdolnumbers were Aretha Franklin covers, including "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman", which is considered her breakout moment during the competition.[193]Other soul acts who influenced Clarkson wereWhitney Houston,[194][195]Mariah Carey,Etta JamesandStevie Wonder.[196]Clarkson was also influenced byChristina Aguilera,[197]by rock acts such asRadiohead,Garbage,Aerosmith, andJimi Hendrix,[196][198]as well asReba McEntire,Bette Midler, andRosemary Clooney.[11]Regarding her musical influence, Clarkson explained:
I grew up with three totally different parents that were into different music. My stepfather is intoWillie NelsonandElvisand all that kind of stuff. And my real father is into Whitney and Mariah, and Aretha, all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion,Barbra [Streisand],Bette Midler, all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like ten years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up lovingGuns N' Roses. I was all aboutMetallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I loveAerosmithandNo Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.[199]
Clarkson often covers rock songs on her Kellyoke segment of her talk show, such as Metallica's "Sad but True", andHeart's "Crazy on You".[200]
The[talent] showjust gives you your 15 minutes. It gives you the chance to be seen on television. It's what you do afterwards that really counts. A lot of people just want to be famous. If that's your goal, it's not going to be long term. Anyone can be famous. It's calledYouTube.
Clarkson has scored over 100 number ones on theBillboardchartsand has a star on theHollywood Walk of Fame. Clarkson has sold over 25 million albums and 45 million singles worldwide, including 14 million albums and 35 million digital singles in the United States alone.[68]She became the first artist to top each ofBillboard'spop,adult contemporary,countryanddancecharts.[202]She was ranked nineteenth onVH1's list of100 Greatest Women in Music. Television channelFuseincluded Clarkson among "30 Greatest Musicians to Come From Singing Competitions" list.[203]Rolling Stoneranked her 194 on their list of 200 Best Singers of All Time in 2023.[204]In 2025,Billboardlisted Clarkson as the 11th biggest female artist of the 21st century (27th overall).[205]
Music executiveSimon Cowellbelieved that "What [Clarkson] sold in the UK, Europe, Asia had nothing to do withAmerican Idol. It had everything to do with the fact that she made a great record and she's got an incredible voice. She's not a girl who got lucky in a talent competition; we got lucky to find her."[206]According toThe Hollywood Reporter, Clarkson is "the embodiment of the perfect pop star. Her unmistakable pipes are a powerful presence in top 40 and country, with forays into anthemic rock and dance."[207]Nolan Feeney fromTimeasserted that Clarkson "has had more of a lasting impact on the pop music landscape than casual listeners might realize."[208]
According toBillboard, Clarkson was a "phenomenon" who "helped legitimize" the impact oftalent shows.[209]The Washington Postwrote that "Clarkson's powerhouse voice and dynamic presence signaled that the music industry should take these reality show contestants seriously: Her first two albums,ThankfulandBreakaway, sold about ten million copies combined, and her pop tunes became empowerment anthems across the globe."[210]In 2007, journalistNekesa Mumbi Moodyreported that the success ofBreakawayin particular was the true pivotal moment in establishingAmerican Idol's credibility, proving that the show was capable of "finding someone who would have a career with longevity".[211]Glenn Gamboa ofNewsdaybelieved Clarkson "has set the standard for all singing competition contestants with her savvy mix of pop, rock and country."[212]Fox Broadcasting Companysaid that Clarkson gave "lasting credibility" toAmerican Idoland "in so many ways she cleared a road" for all of the next contestants."[213]George Varga fromThe San Diego Union-Tribuneunderlined the difference of Clarkson from most other talent show contestants is that she "writes or co-writes a fair number of [her] own songs. She is also the only one whose quest to follow her artistic instincts—the better to rock out and break free from theIdolcookie-cutterpop mold—prompted her to fire her management team and engage in a prolonged public battle with her record company, RCA."[214]
Jon Lisi fromPopMatterscited Clarkson as one of the forces of female domination in pop music of the 2000s. He explained that "Clarkson's anti-sexual image appealed to those who were uncomfortable withBritney Spears' overt exhibitionism. When Clarkson performed "Since U Been Gone" at the2005 MTV Video Music Awards, for instance, she only showed her midriff, and it was clear that she was marketing herself to an alternative group of young females who liked pop music's conventional sound but didn't want to be confronted with sexual imagery."[215]Mickey Rapkin ofBillboardmagazine, who called Clarkson a role model and compared her vocals to golden-era Aretha Franklin, stated that Clarkson "has never shied away from speaking her mind, whether in her propulsive pop anthems or on her filter-free Twitter feed."[216]Clarkson has been an influence on other artists, includingVanessa Hudgens,[217]Demi Lovato,[218]Ava Max,[219]Jordin Sparks,[220]Ashley Tisdale,[221]Avril Lavigne,[222]as well as country music singers such asKelsea BalleriniandPriscilla Block.[223][224]

The California Labor Commissioner ruled that Blackstock violated the state'sTalent Agencies Actby handling these deals, which should have been managed by Clarkson's talent agents atCreative Artists Agency. The ruling included commissions from Clarkson's role onThe Voiceand other promotional agreements, but did not require repayment for deals related toThe Kelly Clarkson Show.[234]
In October 2019, Clarkson said that she has been managing anautoimmunecondition and athyroidcondition since 2006,[235][236]which she had previously addressed onTodayin 2018.[237]
In February 2022, Clarkson changed her legal name to Kelly Brianne. In an interview, she revealed the name change was for her personal life, while her public name would remain the same. Clarkson stated the reason behind her name change was due to a strained relationship with her late father.[1]
In April 2007, Clarkson took part in "Idol Gives Back", a fundraiser for people in poverty in both Africa and the U.S., performing "Up to the Mountain" along withJeff Beck.[238]She would also perform a five-song set later that year on the American leg ofLive Earthconcerts opting for environmentalawareness about climate change. She has served as ambassador for theMarch of Dimessince she was onAmerican Idol, raising money regularly and assisting in volunteer service, having walked for "March for Babies", for the cause of improvement of the health of mothers and babies.[239]Clarkson, additionally, got involved in the organization "Houses of Hope", who take care and build orphanages for children inSouth Africawho have been affected byHIV/AIDS, abuse and poverty.[240]She has visited those children and also participated in "A Night for Hope" fund-raiser concert (held by Clarkson's background vocal singers, Jill and Kate), where she performed a song she wrote after her trip to South Africa, "You Still Won't Know What It's Like". Clarkson also supports the charitiesSave the Children,UNICEF, "Do Something" and "STOMP Out Bullying" and music causes like theSave the Music Foundation.[241][242]
Clarkson had a ranch in Texas for unwanted animals, which included amputee goats, blind dogs, and horses that survived colic; there are more than 80 animals at the sanctuary. She helped provide veterinary care for them and found them an adoptive family.[citation needed]Clarkson performed in a benefit concert on March 1, 2013, supporting theOmahabased Opportunity Education Foundation, an organization that provides access to education for children around the world, stating "Education was a key part of my childhood, and I am better for it. Anything for education I am really into and especially for kids. A lot of people don't have computers, and they can't afford them. Without education, you get far behind. As long as they have a chance, you know, I think that's important. I want every kid to have a chance."[243]In 2013, Clarkson teamed up withState Farm Insuranceto support teen safe driving as a part of Celebrate My Drive program.[244]In 2013, Clarkson supportedFeeding America,The Ad Counciland their Child Hunger PSA Campaign, which provides food for children facing hunger.[245]Also in 2013, Clarkson participated inGreen Mountain Coffee's Great Coffee, Good Vibes, Choose Fair Trade campaign by traveling to coffee farms in Peru to draw attention to the importance of beingFair TradeCertified.[246]

He felt like she has something that was different – something new and fresh."[32]
Monáe signed to the label, Bad Boy, in 2006. The label's chief role was to facilitate her exposure on a much broader scale rather than develop the artist and her music, as Mitchell noted: "She was already moving, she already had her records – she had a self-contained movement." Combs and Big Boi wanted to take their time and build her profile organically and allow the music to grow rather than put out "a hot single which everyone jumps on, and then they fade because it's just something of the moment."[32]
In 2007, Monáe released her first solo work,Metropolis.It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or "suites", which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series,Metropolis: Suite I (The Chase)in mid-2007, these plans were altered following signing with Sean Combs's label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitledMetropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition)and included two new tracks. The EP was critically acclaimed, garnering Monáe a 51st Annual Grammy AwardsGrammynomination forBest Urban/Alternative Performancefor the single "Many Moons",[33]festival appearances and opening slots forindie popbandof Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for bandNo Doubton their summer 2009 tour.[34]Her single "Open Happiness" was featured in the 2009 season finale ofAmerican Idol.[35]Monáe told MTV about the concept for her new album and also discussed analter egonamed Cindi Mayweather. She said:
Cindy is an android and I love speaking about the android because they are the new "other". People are afraid of the other and I believe we're going to live in a world with androids because of technology and the way it advances. The first album she was running because she had fallen in love with a human and she was being disassembled for that.[36]
In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album,The ArchAndroid. The album was released on May 18, 2010. The second and third suites ofMetropolisare combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter ego, Cindi Mayweather – also the protagonist ofMetropolis: The Chase Suite– becomes amessianicfigure to theandroidcommunity of Metropolis.[37]Monáe announced plans to shoot a video for each song onThe ArchAndroidand create a film,graphic noveland a touring Broadway musical based on the album.[38]TheMetropolisconcept series draws inspiration from a wide range of musical, cinematic and other sources, ranging fromAlfred HitchcocktoDebussytoPhilip K. Dick. The series puts Fritz Lang's 1927 silent filmMetropolis, which Monáe referred to as "the godfather of science-fiction movies", in special regard.[39][40]Aside from sharing a name, they also share visual styles (the cover forThe ArchAndroidis inspired by the iconic poster forMetropolis), conceptual themes and political goals, using expressionistic future scenarios to examine and explore contemporary ideas of prejudice and class. Both also include a performing female android, though to very different effect. WhereMetropolisandroid Maria is the evil, havoc-sowing double of the messianic figure to the city's strictly segregated working class, Monáe's messianic android muse Cindi Mayweather represents an interpretation of androids as that segregated minority, which Monáe describes as "...theOther. And I feel like all of us, whether in the majority or the minority, felt like the Other at some point."[39][41]
Monáe received the Vanguard Award from theAmerican Society of Composers, Authors and Publishersat the Rhythm & Soul Music Awards in 2010.[42]Monáe coveredCharlie Chaplin'sSmileon Billboard.com in June 2010.

In her 2013 interview withfuse, Monáe said "Q.U.E.E.N." was inspired by conversations she shared with Erykah Badu about the treatment of marginalized people, especially African-American women, and the title is an acronym "for those who are marginalized"; Q standing for the queer community, U standing for the "untouchables", the first E standing for "emigrants", the latter standing for "excommunicated" and N standing for "negroid".[54]Thematically,The Electric Ladycontinues the utopian cyborg concepts of its predecessors, while presenting itself in more plainspoken, introspective territory in addition to experimenting with genres beyond conventionalfunkand soul such asjazz("Dorothy Dandridge Eyes"),pop-punk("Dance Apocalyptic"),gospel("Victory") and woozy, sensual vocal ballads ("PrimeTime", featuringMiguel).

The album was nominated forAlbum of the YearandBest Progressive R&B Albumat the66th Annual Grammy Awards.[130]
Monáe has amezzo-sopranovoice.[131]The Telegraphpublished an interview with Monáe, talking about her first studio album, in which the journalist Bernadette McNulty said, "I begin to worry for a moment that Monáe may not just be a humourless science-fictionnerd, but actually an android herself, created in a laboratory as a super-musical cross betweenJames Brown,Judy Garland,André 3000andSteve Jobs, invented to test the desperate incredulity of music journalists." She also compared Monáe to artists such asAnnie Lennox,Lauryn Hill, andCorinne Bailey Rae.[132]Monáe's musical styles have been described as "a soaring orchestral trip enlivened with blockbuster vocals, mysterious imagery and notes of Sixties pop and jazz".[133]The Guardianhas noted some of Monáe's influences asMichael Jackson,Janet Jackson,Prince,Outkast,Erykah Badu,James Brown,Grace Jones,Stevie Wonder,David Bowie,Jimi Hendrix,Bernard Herrmann,Funkadelicand theIncredible String Band.[29]Matthew Valnes likens Monáe's dancing style in the music video for "Tightrope" to that of James Brown.[134]In an opinion piece forThe Quietus,[135]John Calvert places Janelle Monáe within theAfrofuturismmovement, pointing out her similarities toSun RaandGeorge Clinton. He asserts that Janelle Monáe is innovating the genre. Monáe has said she has an alter ego from the year 2719, named Cindi Mayweather.[136]
Inher first EP, Monáe gave this alter ego a back story: she was on the run after breaking the law in her home town of Metropolis by falling in love with a human, Anthony Greendown. Monáe has expanded on Cindi's mythos, saying, "The Archandroid, Cindi, is the mediator, between the mind and the hand. She's the mediator between the haves and the have-nots, the oppressed and the oppressor. She's like theArchangelin theBible, and whatNeorepresents toThe Matrix."[137]In hersecond album, Cindi Mayweather returned to Earth to liberate Metropolitans from the Great Divide, an oppressive oligarchy that used time travel to "suppress freedom and love".[138]Chris Champion ofThe ObserverdescribedMetropolisandThe ArchAndroidas "psychedelic soulwith a sci-fi twist".[139]Matthew Valnes describes Monáe as innovating a more contemporary Neo-Afrofuturism, where the android role is used as a tool to critique the representation of Black female musicians in the funk genre. Funk music of 1960s through 1980s is a prevalent music style influencing Monáe. The website for Monáe's Wondaland Arts Society Collective asserts, "We believe there are only three forms of music; good music, bad music, and funk."[134]Monáe has also referred to herself as a "funkstress".[140]
Monáe's roots in Kansas City, Kansas, where she was born and raised, are evident in her lyrics and style. According to Carrie Battan'sPitchforkfeature on Monáe, the song "Ghetto Woman" directly addresses Monáe's working-class K.C., Kansas mother – as well as the portrayal of working-class black women in U.S. culture – with the line "Carry on, ghetto woman, even when the news portrays you less than you could be."[1]Monáe also told theLondon Evening Standardshe has internalized her KCK (K.C., KS) roots by wearing the working-class uniform of her parents and expressing concern that she cannot let "her community down".[141]On the albumThe ArchAndroid, especially in songs like "Cold War" or "BabopbyeYa", Monáe relates "the dystopian cityscapes depicted in Metropolis to the boarded-up projects of poverty-wracked Kansas".[142]Kansas City, therefore, not only represents Monáe's physical roots within her hometown, but also serves as an important influence on the lyrics and science-fictional setting.
I feel like I have a responsibility to my community and other young girls to help redefine what it looks like to be a woman. I don't believe in men's wear or women's wear, I just like what I like. And I think we should just be respected for being an individual... I've been inVogue, now, and different publications, which is cool, because I think that it just shows a different perspective of how women can dress.
Monáe's signature style is hertuxedowardrobe. She said "I bathe in it, I swim in it, and I could be buried in it. A tux is such a standard uniform, it's so classy and it's a lifestyle I enjoy. The tux keeps me balanced. I look at myself as a canvas. I don't want to cloud myself with too many colors or I'll go crazy. It's an experiment I'm doing. I think I want to be in the Guinness Book of World Records."[143]Monáe's signature look harkens back todandyism.[144]CitingGrace JonesandJosephine Bakeras role models, Monáe takes the classical 18th-century look in the classical white and black pattern.[145]Monáe's signature look can also be attributed to the early days in her career, when she was employed as a maid. She mentioned this in her acceptance speech for the "Young, Gifted, and Black" award at the 2012Black Girls Rock!ceremony.[146]Monáe has been known to distribute theTen Droid Commandments, which encourages her fans to be individuals.[137]The Telegraphalso commented on her image as an artist, saying, "Sitting in a grey, airless record company office, this slight, stiff young woman delivers her speech in slow, deliberate tones, utterly expressionless. Dressed in her trademark starched shirt and tuxedo, hair immaculately coiffed, Monáe's face is an opaque mask of perfection: all silken smooth skin, button nose and glassy brown eyes."[132]Monáe describes tuxedos as a uniform for her career, speaks of wanting to redefine how women dress,[137]and has been featured in the "Style 100" ofInStylemagazine.[147]TheCouncil of Fashion Designers of America Awardshonored Monáe with the Board of Directors' Tribute and the American Ingenuity Award for her "straoridanra ability to experiment in fashion".[148][149]
When it comes to her acting career, Monáe expressed desire to shape it around that ofJohnny Depp, stating that he has a very vast career: "The amount of roles:Willy WonkatoSweeney Toddto all of the dramatic roles. Whatever the Janelle Monáe version of that is. Maybe something even better..."[150]
During a 2011 interview withLondon Evening Standard, Monáe said she "only dates androids", a reference to her musical alter ego found in many of her songs. She also said, "I speak about androids because I think the android represents the new 'other'. You can compare it to being a lesbian or being a gay man or being a Black woman... what I want is for people who feel oppressed or feel like the 'other' to connect with the music and to feel like, 'She represents who I am.'" She added that she would talk about her sexual orientation "in due time".[141]In 2013, Monáe said she wants both men and women to "still be attracted to [her]" and expressed support for theLGBTQ community.[151]
Monáe has said she identifies with bothbisexualityandpansexuality.[23]On January 10, 2020, shetweetedthehashtag#IAmNonbinary, along with a quoted tweet, which trended on Twitter that day.[152][153]Monáe said in an interview withThe Cuta month after the tweet that "I tweeted the #IAmNonbinary hashtag in support of Nonbinary Day and to bring more awareness to the community. I retweeted theSteven Universememe 'Are you a boy or a girl? I'm an experience' because it resonated with me, especially as someone who has pushed boundaries of gender since the beginning of my career. I feel my feminine energy, my masculine energy, and energy I can't even explain."[154]
In April 2022, shecame outpublicly asnon-binaryon theRed Table Talksaying, "I'm nonbinary, so I just don't see myself as a woman, solely... I feel like god is so much bigger than the 'he' or the 'she.' And if I am from God, I am everything."[155]In the interview, she also acknowledged having been in bothmonogamousandpolyamorousrelationships.[155]Following the interview, a representative of Monáe said that she "continues to use she/her pronouns."[156]In an interview with theLos Angeles Times, however, Monáe identified herself as non-binary and added that her "pronouns are free-ass motherfucker—and they/them, her/she."[157][158]

I'd just come out of this weird rave scene, and I wasn't really sure what to make of that. And, when I got signed, I hated pop music; I wanted to make bad rap music. I didn't know who I was. I didn't know what I liked. Even though I was signed, I was still figuring it out."[18]She eventually flew toLos Angelesto meet producers and found it "wasn't working out for me" until she met with American producerAriel Rechtshaid. They had a two-hour session and wrote the song "Stay Away". She stated that was "when things started to come together".[22][18]Early in 2011, she was featured on theAlex Metricsingle "End of the World".
