Judyis a 2019biographicaldrama filmbased on the life of American entertainerJudy Garland. Directed byRupert Goold, it is an adaptation of theOlivier- andTony-nominatedWest EndandBroadwayplayEnd of the RainbowbyPeter Quilter. The film starsRenée Zellweger,[5][6]Jessie Buckley,Finn Wittrock,Rufus Sewell, andMichael Gambon.[7][8]
The film follows Garland's career during the last year of her life, when she relocated her stage career to England, coupled with flashbacks of her childhood, most prominently the shooting of her part asDorothy GaleinThe Wizard of Oz(1939), her most famous film role. After some initial success in a run of sell-out concerts at theTalk of the Townin London, her efforts eventually stop making progress and even start to worsen as her health deteriorates.
Judypremiered at the46th Telluride Film Festivalon 30 August 2019, and was released in the United States on 27 September 2019, and in the United Kingdom on 2 October 2019. The film received generally positive reviews, with Zellweger's performance garnering widespread acclaim. For her portrayal of Garland, Zellweger won theAcademy Award for Best Actress, as well as theGolden Globe Award,SAG Award,BAFTA AwardandCritics' Choice Movie Award.
In the 1930s, 16-year-old actressJudy Garlandis told byMetro-Goldwyn-Mayerstudio head,Louis B. Mayeron the set ofThe Wizard of Oz, that she has a gift other girls do not. Her singing talent is nearly unmatched while she is able to surpass the success ofShirley Templeas a Hollywood child star. As her career takes off, Judy is forced by a ruthless studio minder to takeamphetaminesagainst her will; one such instance occurs during her date withMickey Rooney. She is even denied permission to sleep due to the demanding schedule. Responding to Judy's criticisms, Mayer explains that she is exhausted by her working hours; even using emotional and physical intimidation to keep her in line.
In her forties, Judy has been performing withLornaand Joey, her two children from her marriage toSidney Luft, her third husband. Later, the trio try to check into their hotel but are turned away for previous nonpayment. Because of this, Judy is forced to return home to Sidney, who has since divorced her.
At a party, Judy meets nightclub ownerMickey Deans, and they become friends. In 1968, she is told by her agent of England being free to host her upcoming performances, but that the U.S. reception to her has cooled due to her performance unreliability and moodiness. She decides to embark for there, leaving Lorna and Joey with Sidney, which is difficult for her.
While in England, substance abuse keeps Judy from performing reliably. She is late to her London premiere and assistants are called upon to check on her health and fix her make-up. The fans are enthusiastic and her performance is excellent. During the show, she starts to sing the "Clang, clang, clang..." lyrics to "The Trolley Song" to loud applause.
Judy meets two adoring gay fans at the stage door on her way out and joins them for a late-night snack at their flat. They bond over their difficulties, and she sings "Get Happy" while one of the fans plays the piano. Deans comes to London on a surprise visit, which cheers her up. She still has trouble making her stage performances on time because of substance abuse and anxiety.
Her sponsoring British agent has Judy examined by avoice specialistdoctor. She says she had atracheotomytwo years prior, which weakened her voice. The doctor diagnoses physical and mental exhaustion, which requires rest for recovery. Her relationship with Deans is a support to her personal life, and they marry, making him her fifth husband. She still thinks about Lorna and Joey and suffers from being separated from them. They, however, are happy in school in California. Deans has bad news about a money deal that fell through, which means she must stay in England to make ends meet. At her next performance, Judy passes out on stage and is heckled. Her singing engagement is terminated but she returns for a final night on stage, where she asks to perform one last song. She breaks down while singing "Over the Rainbow" but recovers with the encouragement of supportive fans and is able to complete the performance. She asks, "You won't forget me, will you?" to the audience, who applaud before she ends her performance by saying, "Promise you won't." The film's end card says Judy died six months later, in summer 1969, aged 47.

The film had its world premiere at theTelluride Film Festivalon 30 August 2019.[12][13]It also screened at theToronto International Film Festivalon 10 September 2019.[14]It was theatrically released in the United States on 27 September 2019, byRoadside AttractionsandLD Entertainment, and in the United Kingdom on 2 October 2019, by20th Century Fox,Pathé's British Distributor.[1][15][16][17]
The film grossed $24.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $18.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $43.2 million.[4][2]
The film made $2.9 million in its opening weekend, from 461 theatres, finishing seventh at the box office; 60% of its audiences was female, while 79% were over the age of 35.[18][19]It expanded to 1,458 theatres the following weekend and made $4.6 million, finishing sixth, before making $3.2 million in its third weekend, returning to seventh place.[20][21]
On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 339 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The website's consensus reads, "Led by a deeply committed performance from Renée Zellweger,Judycaptures the waning days of a beloved performer with clear-eyed compassion."[22]OnMetacritic, it has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[23]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave it an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.[19]
Zellweger garnered much critical acclaim for her performance in the title role, with several critics labelling her a frontrunner to win theAcademy Award for Best Actress, which she would later go on to win.[24]Peter TraversofRolling Stonecalled her portrayal of Garland "the performance of the year",[25]while Zoe Gahan ofVanity Fairwrote, "a stellar stage-stomping performance. It is hard to tell where Garland stops and Zellweger starts... Go and see this film. Laugh and weep, bawl your eyes out—she deserves every tear."[26]Eric Kohn ofIndieWiregave the film a "C", stating that "Zellweger inhabits the role of the jaded, soul-searching musical icon reasonably well within a dreary and unremarkable saga that finds her grappling with her past, contending with pill-popping addictions and a broken family. It's a familiar story thatJudystruggles to freshen up, at least until Zellweger takes the mic."[27]
Monica Castillo ofRogerEbert.comgave the film two out of four stars; though she praised how it contextualized Garland's abusive childhood, she criticized Goold's direction and Zellweger's performance, stating that "there are spots in the movie where Zellweger's affected manners become too distracting and overshadow everything else around her...Try as she might, Zellweger's Judy never goes beyond an impression of the multi-talented artist; her all-caps version of acting fails to allow the role to feel natural."[28]

Pathé SAS[2](French:[pate]; styled asPATHÉ!) is a French major film production and distribution company, owning a number of cinema chains through its subsidiaryPathé Cinémasand television networks across Europe.
It is the name of a network of French businesses that were founded and originally run by the Pathé Brothers of France starting in 1896. In the early 1900s, Pathé became the world's largest film equipment and production company, as well as a major producer ofphonograph records. In 1908, Pathé invented thenewsreelthat was shown in cinemas before a feature film.[3]
Pathé is the second-oldest operating film company, behindGaumont, which was established in 1895.
The company was founded asSociété Pathé Frères(French:[patefʁɛʁ]; "Pathé Brothers Company") inParis, France on 28 September 1896, by the four brothersCharles, Émile, Théophile and Jacques Pathé.[4]During the first part of the 20th century, Pathé became the largest film equipment and production company in the world,[5]as well as a major producer ofphonograph records.
The driving force behind the film operation and phonograph business wasCharles Pathé, who had helped open aphonographshop in 1894 and established a phonograph factory atChatouon the western outskirts of Paris. The Pathé brothers began selling Edison and Columbia phonographs and accompanyingcylinder recordsand later, the brothers designed and sold their own phonographs that incorporated elements of other brands.[6]Soon after, they also started marketing pre-recorded cylinder records. By 1896 the Pathé brothers had offices andrecording studiosnot only in Paris, but also inLondon,Milan, andSt. Petersburg. Pathé manufactured cylinder records until approximately 1914. In 1905,[7]the Pathé brothers entered the growing field ofdisc records.[8]
In France, Pathé became the largest and most successful distributor of cylinder records and phonographs. These, however, failed to make headway in foreign markets such as theUnited Kingdomand theUnited Stateswhere other brands were already in widespread use.[9]
In December 1928, the French and British Pathé phonograph assets were sold to the BritishColumbia Graphophone Company. In July 1929, the assets of the American Pathé record company were merged into the newly formedAmerican Record Corporation.[7]
The Pathé and Pathé-Marconi labels and catalogue still survive, first as imprints ofEMIand now currently EMI's successorParlophone Records. In 1967EMI Italianatook control of the entire catalog. In turn, theUniversal Music Groupacquired EMI Italiana in 2013.
As the phonograph business became successful, Pathé saw the opportunities offered by new means of entertainment and in particular by the fledglingmotion pictureindustry. Having decided to expand the record business to include film equipment, the company expanded dramatically. To finance its growth, the company took the nameCompagnie Générale des Établissements Pathé Frères Phonographes & Cinématographes(sometimes abbreviated asCGPC) in 1897, and its shares were listed on theParis Stock Exchange.[10]In 1896,Mitchell MarkofBuffalo,New York, became the first American to import Pathé films to the United States, where they were shown in the Vitascope Theater.[11]
In 1907, Pathé acquired theLumière brothers' patents and then set about to design an improved studio camera and to make their own film stock. Their technologically advanced equipment, new processing facilities built atVincennes, and aggressive merchandising combined with efficient distribution systems allowed them to capture a huge share of the international market. They first expanded toLondonin 1902 where they set up production facilities and a chain of cinemas.[12]
By 1909, Pathé had built more than 200 cinemas in France and Belgium and by the following year they had facilities inMadrid,Moscow,RomeandNew York Cityplus Australia and Japan. Slightly later, they opened a film exchange inBuffalo, New York.[12]Through itsAmerican subsidiary, it was part of theMPPCcartel of production in the United States. It participated in theParis Film Congressin February 1909 as part of a plan to create a similar European organisation. The company withdrew from the project in a second meeting in April which fatally undermined the proposal. In 1906, Pathé Frères had pioneered the luxury cinema with the opening of the Omnia Cinéma-Pathé in Paris.[13]
Prior to the outbreak ofWorld War I, Pathé dominated Europe's market in motion picture cameras and projectors. It has been estimated[14]that at one time, 60 percent of all films were shot with Pathé equipment. In 1908, Pathé distributedExcursion to the Moonby Segundo de Chomón, an imitation ofGeorges Méliès'sA Trip to the Moon. Pathé and Méliès worked together in 1911.[15]Méliès made a filmBaron Munchausen's Dream, his first film to be distributed by Pathé. Pathé's relationship with Méliès soured, and after he went bankrupt in 1913,  his last film was never released by Pathé.[16]
After World War I, Charles Pathé started divesting himself from various film interests, believing that the French film industry would never recover after 1918.[17]The company's subsequent decline relegated Pathé primarily as a distributor of short subjects and it became a minor player in the mainstream film industry.[17]
Worldwide, the company emphasised research, investing in such experiments as hand-coloured film and the synchronisation of film and gramophone recordings. In 1908, Pathé invented thenewsreelthat was shown in theatres prior to the feature film. The news clips featured the Pathé logo of a crowing rooster at the beginning of each reel. In 1912, it introduced 28 mm non-flammable film and equipment under the brand name Pathescope.Pathé Newsproduced cinema newsreels from 1910, up until the 1970s when production ceased as a result of mass television ownership.[18]
In the United States, beginning in 1914, the company built film production studios inFort Leeand Jersey City, New Jersey, where their building still stands.The Heights, Jersey Cityproduced the extremely successful serialised episodes calledThe Perils of Pauline. By 1918 Pathé had grown to the point where it was necessary to separate operations into two distinct divisions. With Emile Pathé as chief executive,Pathé Recordsdealt exclusively with phonographs and recordings. Brother Charles managedPathé-Cinéma',' which was responsible for film production, distribution, and exhibition.[19]
In 1922 they introduced thePathé Babyhome film system using a new9.5 mm film stock, which became popular during the next few decades. In 1921, Pathé sold off its United States motion picture production arm. It was renamed "Pathé Exchange" and later merged intoRKO Pictures, disappearing as an independent brand in 1931. Pathé sold its British film studios toEastman Kodakin 1927, while maintaining the theatre and distribution arm.[19]
Pathé was already in substantial financial trouble whenBernard Natantook control of the company in 1929. Studio founderCharles Pathéhad been selling assets for several years to boost investor value and keep the studio's cash flow healthy. The company's founder had even sold Pathé's name and "rooster" trademark to other companies in return for a mere two percent of revenues. Natan had the bad luck to take charge of the studio just as theGreat Depressionconvulsed the French economy.[20][21]
Natan attempted to steady Pathé's finances and implement modern film industry practices at the studio. He acquired another film studio,Société des Cinéromans, fromArthur BernèdeandGaston Leroux, which let Pathé expand into projector and electronics manufacturing. He also bought the Fornier chain of motion picture theatres and rapidly expanded the chain's nationwide presence.[20][21][22]The French press, however, attacked Natan mercilessly for his stewardship of Pathé. Many of these attacks wereantisemitic.[23]
Pathé-Natan did well under Natan's guidance. Between 1930 and 1935, despite the world economic crisis, the company made 100 millionfrancsin profits, and produced and released more than 60 feature films (just as many films as major American studios produced at the time). He resumed production of the newsreelPathé News, which had not been produced since 1927.[20]
Natan also invested heavily into research and development to expand Pathé's film business. In 1929, he pushed Pathé intosound film. In September, the studio produced its first sound feature film, and its first sound newsreel a month later. Natan also launched two new cinema-related magazines,Pathé-RevueandActualités Féminines, to help market Pathé's films and build consumer demand for cinema. Under Natan, Pathé also funded the research ofHenri Chrétien, who developed theanamorphic lens(leading to the creation ofCinemaScopeand otherwidescreenfilm formats common today).[21][22]
Natan expanded Pathé's business interests into communications industries other than film. In November 1929, Natan established France's firsttelevisioncompany,Télévision-Baird-Natan. A year later, he purchased aradiostation inParisand formed a holding company (Radio-Natan-Vitus) to run what would become a burgeoning radio empire.[20][21][22]
In order to finance the company's continued expansion, Pathé's board of directors (which still included Charles Pathé) had voted in 1930 to issue shares worth 105 million francs. Then theGreat Depressionhit France in 1931, and only 50 percent of the shares were purchased. One of the investor banks collapsed due to financial difficulties unrelated to Pathé's problems, and Pathé was forced to follow through with the purchase of several cinema chains it no longer could afford to buy.  Although the company continued to make a profit, it lost more money thanks to these acquisitions than it could bring in.[21][22]In 1935, a commercial court began examining Pathé's accounts, and by 1936 it was declared bankrupt and Natan was dismissed.[24]The studios were not doing badly and continued to make films,[24]but his companies went into receivership and were claimed by the state.
French authorities pursued charges offraudagainst Natan, including financing the purchase of the company without any collateral, of bilking investors by establishing fictitiousshell corporations, and financial mismanagement. He was also accused of hiding his Romanian and Jewish heritage by changing his name. In 1938, Natan was arrested and imprisoned, never to regain his freedom. In 1939 he wasindictedand sentenced to four years in jail.[24]As a result, he was in prison when France fell to the Nazis, a time when other Jewish filmmakers fled or went into hiding. On his release from prison in 1942, he was delivered to the Nazis, and by September 1942 had been deported toAuschwitz, where he was murdered.[20][21][22][25]
In 1943, the company was forced to undergo a restructuring, and was acquired by Adrien Ramauge, changing its name to Société Nouvelle Pathé Cinema.[26]Over the years, the business underwent a number of changes including diversification into producing programmes for the burgeoning television industry. During the 1970s, operating theatres overtook film production as Pathé's primary source of revenue.
In the late 1980s, Italian financierGiancarlo Parrettitried to make a bid for Pathé, even taking overCannonand renaming itPathé Communicationsin anticipation of owning the storied studio. Parretti's shady past, however, raised enough eyebrows in the French government that the deal fell through. It turned out to be a fortunate decision, as Parretti later took overMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and merged it with his Pathé Communications Group to createMGM-Pathé Communicationsin 1990, only to lose it in bankruptcy in late 1991.
In 1990Chargeurs, a French conglomerate led by Jérôme Seydoux, took control of the company.[27]As a result of the deregulation of the French telecommunications market, in June 1999 Pathé merged withVivendi, with the exchange ratio for the merger fixed at three Vivendi shares for every two Pathé shares.The Wall Street Journalestimated the value of the deal at US$2.59 billion. Following the completion of the merger, Vivendi retained Pathé's interests inBritish Sky BroadcastingandCanalSatellite, a French broadcasting corporation,[28]but then sold all remaining assets to Jérôme Seydoux's family-owned corporation, Fornier SA, which changed its name to Pathé.

In its home country France, Pathé self-distributes its films throughPathé Films(formerly calledAMLF(Agence méditerranéenne de location de films) from 1972 to 1998). On home video, their films are distributed by Fox Pathé Europa, a joint venture betweenWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, Pathé andEuropaCorp.
In August 1992, Pathé's then-parent company Chargeurs purchasedGuild Entertainmentfrom Wembley PLC, becoming Pathé's de-facto UK distributor.[32]Initially,PolyGram Videodistributed Guild's VHS releases until March 1995, when Chargeurs formed a UK rental joint-venture with20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, who became Guild/Pathé's home video distributor, the rental joint-venture would be namedFox Guild Home Entertainment.[33]
After the Chargeurs demerger in 1996,[34]Pathé began retiring the Guild brand, initially rebranding the theatrical arm asGuild Pathé Cinemaand eventually in June 1997, asPathé Distributionafter securing a deal to produce films in the country.[35]The home video division followed suit toward the end of the year, rebranding under the Pathé name, the video rental division Fox Guild Home Entertainment would be renamedFox Pathé Home Entertainmentthe following year. Despite this, Guild Home Video remained as an in-name-only dormant business of Pathé until folding on 17 December 2019.[36]
On 12 March 2009, Pathé announced that they would close their UK/Ireland theatrical distribution unit and form a new partnership withWarner Bros. Picturesto handle the theatrical distribution of their titles in the UK, following a handful of films that flopped at the box office. The move was made so Pathé could focus more on the development and production of its own titles instead of acquisitions. The partnership would allow the two companies working together to identify co-production opportunities. Pathé would remain as an international sales agent for films, while 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment would remain as the distributor for home video.[37]Select film acquisitions that were planned to be distributed by Pathé, such asChatroomandDead Man Running, were sold toRevolver Entertainment.
On 1 February 2011, it was announced that20th Century Foxwould take over as Pathé's theatrical distributor. Pathé UK's co-CEO Francois Ivernel deemed it easier for one company to handle the licensing process for both theatrical and home video.[38]
Withthe purchase of 20th Century Foxbythe Walt Disney Companyon 20 March 2019,Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturestook over distribution of Pathé's material, releasing bothMisbehaviourandThe Human Voice,Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainmentwould release the two films on home video. The longstanding deal with Fox/Disney deal expired on 30 June 2021, and Pathé decided not to renew. Pathé UK managing director Cameron McCracken was pleased with Disney's treatment of the company's films, deeming them to have given the films the same treatment that Fox did.[39]
On 7 June 2021, a few weeks before the expiration of the Fox deal, Pathé UK announced they would revert their distribution toWarner Bros. Pictures, with the first films being released under the new deal beingParallel MothersandThe Duke. Unlike the 2009 deal, this new deal would also include home video and digital rights as well, which Fox/Disney previously handled.[40]
On 15 November 2023, Pathé UK announced that they would exit out of the UK theatrical market and restructure to focus on the premium television market instead. The exit was due to structural changes in the film industry following the impact ofCoronavirus pandemic, issues with the structure of independent distribution in the country (which led to fellow rivalEntertainment One(now Lionsgate Canada) closing their UK distribution arm earlier in the year), some of their filmsflopping at the box office, and the retirement of Cameron McCracken.[41]Some time later,StudioCanal UKtook over distribution of their material on home video through their Elevation Sales joint-venture withLionsgate UK.

Michael John Gambon was born in theCabrasuburb ofDublin[2]on 19 October 1940.[3]His mother, Mary (née Hoare), was a seamstress, while his father, Edward Gambon, was an engineering operative duringWorld War II.[4]His father decided to seek work in the rebuilding of London, and moved the family toMornington Crescentin London'sCamdenborough when Gambon was six. His father arranged for him to be registered as aBritish subject, a decision that would later allow him to receive a substantive (rather than honorary)knighthood.[5][a]Brought up as a strictRoman Catholic, Gambon attended St Aloysius Boys' School inSomers Townand served at the altar.[6]He went on from there toSt Aloysius' CollegeinHighgate, whose former pupils include the actorPeter Sellers.[6][7]The family later moved toNorth End, Kent, where he attended Crayford Secondary School but left with no qualifications at the age of 15.[8]
After leaving school, at the age of 16 Gambon then gained an apprenticeship as a toolmaker withVickers-Armstrongs.[9]By the time he was 21, he was a qualified engineering technician and kept the job for a further year. He acquired a lifelong passion for collecting antique guns, clocks, watches andclassic cars.[10]
At age 24, Gambon wrote a letter toMicheál Mac Liammóir, the Irish theatreimpresariowho ran Dublin'sGate Theatre, accompanied by aCVdescribing a rich and wholly imaginary theatre career: he was taken on.[11]Gambon made his professional stage debut in the Gate Theatre's 1962 production ofOthello, playing "Second Gentleman", followed by a European tour. A year later, auditioning with the openingsoliloquyfromRichard III, he caught the eye ofLaurence Olivierwho was recruiting promising actors for his newNational Theatre Company.[12]Gambon, along withRobert Stephens,Derek JacobiandFrank Finlay, was hired as one of the "to be renowned" and played any number of small roles, appearing on cast lists as "Mike Gambon". The company initially performed at theOld Vic, their first production beingHamlet, directed by Olivier and starringPeter O'Toole. Gambon played for four years in many NT productions, including named roles inThe Recruiting OfficerandThe Royal Hunt of the Sun, working with directorsWilliam GaskillandJohn Dexter.[13]
Gambon made his film debut inLaurence Olivier'sOthelloalongsideMaggie SmithandDerek Jacobiin 1965.[14]After three years at the Old Vic, Olivier advised Gambon to gain experience in provincial rep. In 1967, he left the National Theatre for theBirmingham Repertory Company, which was to give him his first crack at the title roles inOthello(his favourite),MacbethandCoriolanus.[15]In 1967, he made his television debut in theBBCtelevision adaptation ofMuch Ado About Nothingas Watchman No. 4. He also appeared in British programmes such asSoftly, Softly(1967) andPublic Eye(1968). From 1968 to 1970, he featured in the BBC historical seriesThe Borderersas Gavin Kerr. He also had a recurring role in the Canadian seriesThe Challengers(1972). He also appeared in drama anthology series includingPlay for Today,Play of the MonthandITV Playhouse.
In 1974,Eric Thompsoncast him as the melancholy vet inAlan Ayckbourn'sThe Norman ConquestsatGreenwich.[15]A speedy transfer to theWest Endestablished him as a comic actor, squatting at a crowded dining table on a tiny chair and agonising over a choice between black or white coffee. Back at the National, now on theSouth Bank, his next turning point wasPeter Hall's premiere staging ofHarold Pinter'sBetrayal,[15]a performance marked by subtlety – a production photograph shows him embracingPenelope Wiltonwith sensitive hands and long slim fingers (the touch of a master clock-maker). He is also one of the few actors to have mastered the demands of the vastOlivier Theatre. AsSimon Callowonce said: "Gambon's iron lungs and overwhelming charisma are able to command a sort of operatic full-throatedness which triumphs over hard walls and long distances". After his film debut, Gambon was asked byJames BondproducerCubby Broccolito audition for the role in 1970, to replaceGeorge Lazenby.[16]He acted in the British horror filmsNothing But the Night(1973) andThe Beast Must Die(1974).
In 1976 he took the part of Lieutenant Commander Rogers in a filmed version of the playFrench Without Tearsby Terence Rattigan, for a TV episode of the series 'BBC Play of the Month', directed by John Gorrie, with Nicola Pagett, Anthony Andrews, Barbara Kellerman, Tim Woodward and Nigel Havers. Set in a French Villa, the action takes place in a cram school for adults needing to acquire French for business reasons. Scattered throughout are Franglais phrases and schoolboy misunderstandings of the French language.
Gambon's powerful voice and presence were to serve him in good stead inJohn Dexter's masterly staging ofThe Life of GalileobyBertolt Brechtat the National Theatre in 1980, the first Brecht play to become a popular success. Hall called him "unsentimental, dangerous and immensely powerful," andThe Sunday Timescalled his performance "a decisive step in the direction of great tragedy... great acting," while fellow actors paid him the rare compliment of applauding him in the dressing room on the first night.[17]In 1985, he appeared in the British drama filmTurtle Diarydirected byJohn Irvinwith a screenplay adapted byHarold Pinter. The film starredGlenda JacksonandBen Kingsley.[18]
His craggy looks soon made him into acharacter actor, a term which Gambon disputed. For his first majorleadrole inDennis Potter'sThe Singing Detective(1986) he won his firstBritish Academy Television AwardforBest Actor.[19]He starred as detective InspectorJules Maigretinan ITV adaptationof twelve ofGeorges Simenon's books. The National Theatre staged a revival ofA View from the Bridgein 1987 at theCottesloe Theatre. It was directed byAlan Ayckbourn, and Gambon gave an acclaimed performance as Eddie.[20]The Guardiansaid, "In the first place it shows Michael Gambon shaking hands with greatness."[21]In 1989, Gambon starred in thePeter Greenaway's crime dramaThe Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, which also starredHelen Mirren,Tim RothandCiarán Hinds. Gambon played Albert Spica, "The Thief", a violent gangster. The film premiered at the1989 Toronto International Film Festival. Film criticRoger Ebertof theChicago Sun-Timespraised the performances writing, "Mirren and Gambon are among the most distinguished actors in Britain-they've played many of the principal roles in Shakespeare -- and here they find the resources to not only strip themselves of all their defenses, but to do so convincingly."[22]
In 1990, he played Jerry inHarold Pinter'sBetrayalforBBC Radio 3. In 1991, he starred as Tommy Hanbury in an episode of theITVseriesMindercalled "Look Who's Coming To Pinner".Ralph Richardsondubbed himThe Great Gambon, an accolade which stuck, although Gambon dismissed it as a circus slogan.[23][24]But asSheridan Morleyperceptively remarked in 2000, when reviewingNicholas Wright'sCressida: "Gambon's eccentricity on stage now begins to rival that of his great mentor Richardson". Also like Richardson, interviews were rarely given and raised more questions than they answered. Gambon was a very private person, a "non-starry star" as Ayckbourn called him. Off-stage he preferred to stay out of the limelight.[25]He won screen acclaim, while his ravagedKing LearatStratford, while he was still in his early forties, formed a double act with a red-nosedAntony Sheras the Fool sitting on his master's knee like a ventriloquist's doll.
There were also appearances inHarold Pinter'sOld Timesat theHaymarket TheatreandBen Jonson'sVolponeand the brutal sergeant in Pinter'sMountain Language. In 1995, Gambon starred inDavid Hare'sSkylight, withLia Williams, which opened to rave reviews at the National Theatre. The play transferred first toWyndham's Theatreand then on toBroadwayat theBernard B. Jacobs Theatrefor a four-month run which left him in a state of advanced exhaustion.[26]"Skylightwas ten times as hard to play as anything I've ever done" he told Michael Owen in theEvening Standard. "I had a great time in New York, but wanted to return."Varietywrote of his performance, "Gambon, an Irishman revered on the London stage, gives his rough-hewn character a grace that goes beyond the physical".[27]For this performance Gambon received his onlyTony Awardnomination forBest Actor in a Play.[28]
He later starred asFyodor Dostoyevskyin the Hungarian directorKároly Makk's filmThe Gambler(1997) about the writing of Dostoyevsky's novellaThe Gambler. In the 1990s he appeared in films such as,Barry Levinson's fantasy comedyToys(1992), the period dramaDancing at Lughnasa(1998), the action filmPlunkett & Macleane(1998),Michael Mann's political dramaThe Insider(1999) andTim Burton's gothic horror filmSleepy Hollow(1999). He also appeared in the BBC serialWives and Daughters(1999) based on theVictorian novel by the same namebyElizabeth Gaskell.[29]He portrayed Squire Hamley and received his secondBAFTA Awardnomination and win for Best Actor.[30]The New York Timesdescribed Gambon's performance as 'Gruff on the outside, with a huge sentimental streak, the country squire is a familiar type, but he makes him seem endearing and fresh.'[31]
During the 2000s, Gambon appeared in several films includingRobert Altman's murder mystery ensembleGosford Park(2001) where he acted alongsideMaggie Smith,Helen Mirren,Kristin Scott Thomas,Kelly Macdonald,Emily WatsonandStephen Fry. Gambon portrays Sir William McCordle, the imperious master of Gosford Park who has invited distinguished company for a weekend shooting party before a murder throws everything into chaos.Empiredeclared the film, "Altman's best movie in years - an astute exploration of British culture that can stand proudly with his satires of American life. Atmospheric, absorbing, amusing and really fun."[32]The film earned theBAFTA Award for Outstanding British Filmas well as nominations for sixAcademy AwardincludingBest Picture. In 2003, he appeared withRobert DuvallandKevin Costner, playing the principal villain in the Western filmOpen Range.[33]Gambon was not among the actors to graceYasmina Reza's'Art'at Wyndham's. But together withSimon Russell BealeandAlan Bates, he gave a droll radio account of the role of Marc. And for the RSC he shared Reza's two-handerThe Unexpected ManwithEileen Atkins, first at The Pit in the Barbican and then at theDuchess Theatre, a production also intended for New York, but finally delayed by other commitments.
In 2001, he played what he described as "'a physically repulsive" Davies inPatrick Marber's revival of Pinter'sThe Caretaker,[15]but he found the rehearsal period an unhappy experience, and felt that he had let down the author.[citation needed]A year later, playing oppositeDaniel Craig, he portrayed the father of a series of cloned sons inCaryl Churchill'sA Numberat theRoyal Court, remembered for a recumbent moment when he smoked a cigarette, the brightly lit spiral of smoke rising against a black backdrop, an effect which he dreamt up during rehearsals. Gambon starred in a made-for-TV adaptation ofSamuel Beckett'sEndgame(2001) andPerfect Strangers(2001) which together revealed his talent for comedy. Gambon played PresidentLyndon B. Johnsonin the television filmPath to War. About his performanceThe Washington Postsaid: "Gambon is entirely up to the task of making a larger-than-life icon seem painfully – and in the end, helplessly – human. It is a performance of fire and brimstone".[34]He was nominated for anEmmy Awardfor Best Actor in a Mini-series or Movie and aGolden Globe Awardfor Best Actor in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television.
He playedAlbus Dumbledore,Hogwarts' headmaster in the third instalment ofJ. K. Rowling's franchise,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban(2004), taking over the role after the death ofRichard Harrisin 2002; Harris had also played Maigret on television four years before Gambon took that role.[35]Gambon reprised the role of Dumbledore inHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire(2005), which was released in November 2005 in the United Kingdom and the United States.[36]He returned to the role again in the fifth film,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix(2007) and the sixth film,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince(2009).[37][38]He appeared in the final two films of the series,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1(2010) andPart 2(2011). Gambon told an interviewer that, when playing Dumbledore, he did not "have to play anyone really. I just stick on a beard and play me, so it's no great feat. I never ease into a role – every part I play is just a variant of my own personality. I'm not really a character actor at all."[39]
In 2004, he appeared in five films, includingWes Anderson's cult comedyThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou; the British gangster filmLayer Cake; and theatrical dramaBeing Julia.[40]In 2004, Gambon played the lead role (Hamm) inSamuel Beckett's post-apocalyptic playEndgameat theAlbery Theatre, London.[41]In 2005, he finally achieved a lifelong ambition to playFalstaff, inNicholas Hytner's National production ofHenry IV, Parts1and2, co-starring withMatthew Macfadyenas Prince Hal.
