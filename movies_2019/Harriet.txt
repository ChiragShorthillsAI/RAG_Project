In 1849Maryland, aslave state,Araminta "Minty" Rossis newly married tofreedmanJohn Tubman. Minty is a slave on the Brodess plantation, along with her mother and sister. Reverend Green finishes his sermon advising obedience and to follow the Lord's will. Minty's father,Ben, also a freedman, approaches her owner, Edward Brodess, with a lawyer's letter saying that Minty's mother,Harriet "Rit", was to have been freed when she was 45 and her children born free. John and Minty want to start a family and want their children to be born free. Brodess angrily tears up the letter.
In despair, Minty prays for God to kill Brodess and is caught by Brodess' adult son Gideon, who castigates her. When Brodess dies shortly afterward, Gideon offers Minty for sale. Minty, who suffers "spells" since being struck in the head as a girl, has a vision of herself escaping to freedom. She decrees these scenes as visions from God and decides to escape. John offers to accompany Minty, but she leaves him behind, fearing he would lose his freedom if caught with her. Minty meets with her father who tells her to go to Reverend Green for help with her journey.
Minty travels all night and is pursued by Gideon and other men on horseback. Eventually, Gideon corners her at a bridge over a river, where he appeals to her faith and promises not to sell her. Minty jumps anyway, proclaiming her will to "be free or die".
Minty is presumed drowned but successfully makes it toWilmington, Delawareand locates the abolitionistThomas Garrett. He takes her to thePennsylvaniaborder and Minty walks the remaining 25 miles toPhiladelphia, where she meetsWilliam Still, chairman of thePennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society. William encourages her to take a new free name and she chooses Harriet after her mother and Tubman after her husband. Harriet temporarily lodges at Marie Buchanon's, the daughter of a freed slave who was born free and is now a boarding-house proprietor.
After a year in Philadelphia, Harriet begs William to assist bringing her family over. He tells her helping slaves has become harder. Refusing to give up, Harriet successfully makes it to John's homestead with forged papers only to find he has remarried and is expecting a child. Devastated, Harriet receives further visions and is found by her father. With the exception of her parents and sister, Rachel, Harriet leads nine other slaves to safety, five of them being from Gideon's farm. The next day, Gideon realizes and threatens Rachel—who has just given birth—and her children. She reveals to Gideon that Harriet is alive and has recently returned. Gideon thinks this unlikely. Meanwhile, Harriet is admitted to the committee of theUnderground Railroadfor her actions.
Harriet continues to guide slaves to freedom as a conductor on the Underground Railroad, and is dubbed "Moses". However, Rachel is a house slave and will not run because Gideon has sold her children and she hopes one day to be told where they are. She meets Walter who had worked for Bigger Long as a slave catcher and decides to go with her. TheFugitive Slave Actpasses, meaning escaped slaves are in jeopardy of being brought back from free states. At a meeting at the home of leading abolitionist senatorWilliam H. Seward, Harriet insists that she must evade the Act by leading them further to safety in Canada. Gideon is livid when he discovers that Harriet is "Moses". He pursues her to Philadelphia along with Bigger Long, who beats Marie to death.
Harriet then flees toCanadawith help from her friends. Harriet hears that Rachel has died. After receiving a vision that her father is in imminent danger, Harriet returns and takes both her parents north. Over time, the Brodess plantation falls into financial ruin. Brodess' widow vows to catch Harriet, using her sister's children as bait, but Harriet's team overwhelms Gideon's siblings and retrieves the remaining slaves.
In a final confrontation, Gideon shoots Bigger Long dead as he is about to kill Harriet. Harriet then subdues Gideon, but allows him to live, prophesying that he would die on abattlefieldfighting for a lost cause and the sin of slavery. Telling him that her people would be free, she takes his horse and rides away. Harriet later leads an armed expedition of 150 black soldiers in theCombahee River Raid. The epilogue describes some of her accomplishments: She personally freed more than 70 slaves, wasa Unionspy during the Civil War, led 150 black soldiers in the Combahee River Raid, freeing over 750 slaves, and advocated forwomen's suffrage. She died at the approximate age of 91 with the last words: "I go to prepare a place for you".
A biography about Harriet Tubman had been in the works for years, with several actresses rumored to star. In 2015,Viola Daviswas set to star in and produce a Harriet Tubman biopic; however, it never came to fruition.[6]Development on a new film began in May 2016.[7]In February 2017,Cynthia Erivowas cast as Tubman, withSeith Mannthen set to direct, from a screenplay byGregory Allen Howard.[8]
Further development on the film was announced in September 2018, withFocus Featuresset as the new distributor,Kasi Lemmonsattached as director (the first feature film she directed after the box office failure ofBlack Nativity.), andLeslie Odom Jr.,Joe Alwyn,Jennifer Nettles, andClarke Peters, and others, added to the cast.[1][9]Lemmons received co-writer credit with Allen on the final script, and Allen also had the film's "story by" credit. In October,Janelle Monáewas announced as one of several actors newly added to the film, with filming beginning on October 8, 2018, and lasting through December.[10][11][12]
Harrietwas filmed entirely inVirginia, inRichmond,Powhatan,Tamworth,Petersburg, andMathews.Berkeley PlantationinCharles City Countywas used forAuburn, New York.[13]
Harriethad its world premiere at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 10, 2019.[14]
It was theatrically released in the United States on November 1, 2019 byFocus Features.[4][5]Its release for Blu-ray and DVD sales took place on January 14, 2020.[5]
Harrietgrossed $43.1 million in the United States and Canada and $953,432 in other territories for a worldwide total of $44 million,[4]plus $4.8 million with home video sales,[5]against a production budget of $17 million.[3][4][5]In North America, the film was released alongsideTerminator: Dark Fate,Arctic DogsandMotherless Brooklyn, and was projected to gross $7–9 million from 2,059 theaters in its opening weekend.[15][16]The film grossed $3.9 million on its first day, including $600,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to slightly over-perform, debuting to $11.7 million and finishing fourth.[17][3]The film made $7.4 million in its second weekend, finishing sixth, and $4.6 million on its third, finishing tenth.[18][19]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 74% based on 235 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's critics' consensus reads, "Harrietserves as a sincere tribute to a pivotal figure in American history—albeit one undermined by its frustratingly formulaic approach."[20]Metacriticassigned the film a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[21]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film a rare grade of "A+," while those atPostTrakgave it an average 4.5 out of 5 stars and a 69% "definite recommend".[17]
Reviewing forThe New York Observer,Rex Reedwrote: "With enough terror to satisfy modern audiences and enough underplayed plot movement to save it from conventional biopic trajectory, Harriet holds interest and invites respect. It is still not the great Civil War epic it could have been, but it's solid enough to work, and Cynthia Erivo's valiant and committed performance is a wonderful achievement."[22]Richard Roepergave the film three out of four stars in his review for theChicago Sun-Times, applauding Erivo's "convincing" and "powerful" acting as well as Lemmons' approach to the story. He wrote: "The crackling historical fiction frames [Tubman's] harrowing rescue missions in fast-paced, quick-cut style."[23]
Some reviewers were less positive. Eric Kohn ofIndieWiregave the film a "B−",  writing that "Harrietdoesn't attempt to reinvent the biopic, relying instead on a poignant turn by rising screen talent Cynthia Erivo as its soulful centerpiece, against the gorgeous backdrop of John Toll's cinematography and Terence Blanchard's euphoric score. As a sentimental tribute, it hardly transcends expectations—but Erivo's performance injects a palpable urgency to the material that makes up for missed time."[24]InVariety,Owen Gleibermanwrote, "Cynthia Erivo plays the escaped slave Harriet Tubman with a mournful fury, but the rest of Kasi Lemmons' biopic is more dutiful than inspired."[25]

Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

There was a lot of confusion and nonsense where I grew up, so I reacted by creating my own little world.[...] I began to see how music could change lives, and I began to dream about a world where every day was like anime and Broadway, where music fell from the sky and anything could happen.
Janelle Monáe Robinson was born on December 1, 1985, inKansas City, Kansas, and was raised inQuindaro, a working-class community of Kansas City.[23]Her mother, Janet, worked as a janitor and a hotel maid.[23][24]Her father, Michael Robinson Summers, was a truck driver.[25]Monáe's parents separated when Monáe was a toddler and her mother later married a postal worker. Monáe has a younger sister, Kimmy, from her mother's remarriage.[23]
Monáe was raisedBaptistand learned to sing at a local church. Her family members were musicians and performers at the localAfrican Methodist Episcopalchurch, theBaptist church, and theChurch of God in Christ.[23][25]Monáe dreamed of being a singer and a performer from a very young age,[22]and has cited the fictional character ofDorothy GalefromThe Wizard of Ozas a musical influence.[26]The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which Monáe bought two copies of with her first check, was another source of inspiration.[27]She performed songs from the album onJuneteenthtalent shows, winning three years in a row.[23]
As a teenager, Monáe was enrolled in the Coterie Theater's Young Playwrights' Round Table,[28][29]which began writing musicals. One musical, completed when she was around the age of 12, was inspired by the 1979Stevie WonderalbumJourney Through "The Secret Life of Plants".[29]
Monáe attendedF. L. Schlagle High School,[25]and after high school, moved toNew York Cityto study musical theater at theAmerican Musical and Dramatic Academy, where she was the only black woman in her class.[28][29]Monáe enjoyed the experience, but feared that she might lose her edge and "sound, or look or feel like anybody else".[28]In a 2010 interview Monáe explained, "I felt like that was a home but I wanted to write my own musicals. I didn't want to have to live vicariously through a character that had been played thousands of times – in a line with everybody wanting to play the same person."[29]
After a year and a half, Monáe dropped out of the academy and relocated toAtlanta, enrolling atGeorgia Perimeter College. She began writing her own music and performing around the campus.[28]In 2003, Monáe self-released ademo albumtitledThe Audition,[30]which she sold out of the trunk of aMitsubishi Galant.[28]During this period she worked at anOffice Depotbut was fired for answering a fan's e-mail using a company computer, an incident that inspired the song "Lettin' Go", which in turn attracted the attention ofBig Boi.[29]
Monáe appeared on thePurple Ribbon All-StarsalbumGot Purp? Vol. 2as well as on OutKast's 2006 albumIdlewild, where she was featured on the songs "Call the Law" and "In Your Dreams".[31]Big Boi told his friendSean Combsabout Monáe, of whom at the time Combs had not yet heard. Combs soon visited Monáe'sMySpacepage and according to aHitQuartersinterview withBad Boy RecordsA&R person Daniel 'Skid' Mitchell, Combs loved it right away: "[He] loved her look, loved that you couldn't see her body, loved the way she was dancing, and just loved the vibe. He felt like she has something that was different – something new and fresh."[32]
Monáe signed to the label, Bad Boy, in 2006. The label's chief role was to facilitate her exposure on a much broader scale rather than develop the artist and her music, as Mitchell noted: "She was already moving, she already had her records – she had a self-contained movement." Combs and Big Boi wanted to take their time and build her profile organically and allow the music to grow rather than put out "a hot single which everyone jumps on, and then they fade because it's just something of the moment."[32]
In 2007, Monáe released her first solo work,Metropolis.It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or "suites", which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series,Metropolis: Suite I (The Chase)in mid-2007, these plans were altered following signing with Sean Combs's label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitledMetropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition)and included two new tracks. The EP was critically acclaimed, garnering Monáe a 51st Annual Grammy AwardsGrammynomination forBest Urban/Alternative Performancefor the single "Many Moons",[33]festival appearances and opening slots forindie popbandof Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for bandNo Doubton their summer 2009 tour.[34]Her single "Open Happiness" was featured in the 2009 season finale ofAmerican Idol.[35]Monáe told MTV about the concept for her new album and also discussed analter egonamed Cindi Mayweather. She said:
Cindy is an android and I love speaking about the android because they are the new "other". People are afraid of the other and I believe we're going to live in a world with androids because of technology and the way it advances. The first album she was running because she had fallen in love with a human and she was being disassembled for that.[36]
In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album,The ArchAndroid. The album was released on May 18, 2010. The second and third suites ofMetropolisare combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter ego, Cindi Mayweather – also the protagonist ofMetropolis: The Chase Suite– becomes amessianicfigure to theandroidcommunity of Metropolis.[37]Monáe announced plans to shoot a video for each song onThe ArchAndroidand create a film,graphic noveland a touring Broadway musical based on the album.[38]TheMetropolisconcept series draws inspiration from a wide range of musical, cinematic and other sources, ranging fromAlfred HitchcocktoDebussytoPhilip K. Dick. The series puts Fritz Lang's 1927 silent filmMetropolis, which Monáe referred to as "the godfather of science-fiction movies", in special regard.[39][40]Aside from sharing a name, they also share visual styles (the cover forThe ArchAndroidis inspired by the iconic poster forMetropolis), conceptual themes and political goals, using expressionistic future scenarios to examine and explore contemporary ideas of prejudice and class. Both also include a performing female android, though to very different effect. WhereMetropolisandroid Maria is the evil, havoc-sowing double of the messianic figure to the city's strictly segregated working class, Monáe's messianic android muse Cindi Mayweather represents an interpretation of androids as that segregated minority, which Monáe describes as "...theOther. And I feel like all of us, whether in the majority or the minority, felt like the Other at some point."[39][41]
Monáe received the Vanguard Award from theAmerican Society of Composers, Authors and Publishersat the Rhythm & Soul Music Awards in 2010.[42]Monáe coveredCharlie Chaplin'sSmileon Billboard.com in June 2010.

In her 2013 interview withfuse, Monáe said "Q.U.E.E.N." was inspired by conversations she shared with Erykah Badu about the treatment of marginalized people, especially African-American women, and the title is an acronym "for those who are marginalized"; Q standing for the queer community, U standing for the "untouchables", the first E standing for "emigrants", the latter standing for "excommunicated" and N standing for "negroid".[54]Thematically,The Electric Ladycontinues the utopian cyborg concepts of its predecessors, while presenting itself in more plainspoken, introspective territory in addition to experimenting with genres beyond conventionalfunkand soul such asjazz("Dorothy Dandridge Eyes"),pop-punk("Dance Apocalyptic"),gospel("Victory") and woozy, sensual vocal ballads ("PrimeTime", featuringMiguel).

The album was nominated forAlbum of the YearandBest Progressive R&B Albumat the66th Annual Grammy Awards.[130]
Monáe has amezzo-sopranovoice.[131]The Telegraphpublished an interview with Monáe, talking about her first studio album, in which the journalist Bernadette McNulty said, "I begin to worry for a moment that Monáe may not just be a humourless science-fictionnerd, but actually an android herself, created in a laboratory as a super-musical cross betweenJames Brown,Judy Garland,André 3000andSteve Jobs, invented to test the desperate incredulity of music journalists." She also compared Monáe to artists such asAnnie Lennox,Lauryn Hill, andCorinne Bailey Rae.[132]Monáe's musical styles have been described as "a soaring orchestral trip enlivened with blockbuster vocals, mysterious imagery and notes of Sixties pop and jazz".[133]The Guardianhas noted some of Monáe's influences asMichael Jackson,Janet Jackson,Prince,Outkast,Erykah Badu,James Brown,Grace Jones,Stevie Wonder,David Bowie,Jimi Hendrix,Bernard Herrmann,Funkadelicand theIncredible String Band.[29]Matthew Valnes likens Monáe's dancing style in the music video for "Tightrope" to that of James Brown.[134]In an opinion piece forThe Quietus,[135]John Calvert places Janelle Monáe within theAfrofuturismmovement, pointing out her similarities toSun RaandGeorge Clinton. He asserts that Janelle Monáe is innovating the genre. Monáe has said she has an alter ego from the year 2719, named Cindi Mayweather.[136]
Inher first EP, Monáe gave this alter ego a back story: she was on the run after breaking the law in her home town of Metropolis by falling in love with a human, Anthony Greendown. Monáe has expanded on Cindi's mythos, saying, "The Archandroid, Cindi, is the mediator, between the mind and the hand. She's the mediator between the haves and the have-nots, the oppressed and the oppressor. She's like theArchangelin theBible, and whatNeorepresents toThe Matrix."[137]In hersecond album, Cindi Mayweather returned to Earth to liberate Metropolitans from the Great Divide, an oppressive oligarchy that used time travel to "suppress freedom and love".[138]Chris Champion ofThe ObserverdescribedMetropolisandThe ArchAndroidas "psychedelic soulwith a sci-fi twist".[139]Matthew Valnes describes Monáe as innovating a more contemporary Neo-Afrofuturism, where the android role is used as a tool to critique the representation of Black female musicians in the funk genre. Funk music of 1960s through 1980s is a prevalent music style influencing Monáe. The website for Monáe's Wondaland Arts Society Collective asserts, "We believe there are only three forms of music; good music, bad music, and funk."[134]Monáe has also referred to herself as a "funkstress".[140]
Monáe's roots in Kansas City, Kansas, where she was born and raised, are evident in her lyrics and style. According to Carrie Battan'sPitchforkfeature on Monáe, the song "Ghetto Woman" directly addresses Monáe's working-class K.C., Kansas mother – as well as the portrayal of working-class black women in U.S. culture – with the line "Carry on, ghetto woman, even when the news portrays you less than you could be."[1]Monáe also told theLondon Evening Standardshe has internalized her KCK (K.C., KS) roots by wearing the working-class uniform of her parents and expressing concern that she cannot let "her community down".[141]On the albumThe ArchAndroid, especially in songs like "Cold War" or "BabopbyeYa", Monáe relates "the dystopian cityscapes depicted in Metropolis to the boarded-up projects of poverty-wracked Kansas".[142]Kansas City, therefore, not only represents Monáe's physical roots within her hometown, but also serves as an important influence on the lyrics and science-fictional setting.
I feel like I have a responsibility to my community and other young girls to help redefine what it looks like to be a woman. I don't believe in men's wear or women's wear, I just like what I like. And I think we should just be respected for being an individual... I've been inVogue, now, and different publications, which is cool, because I think that it just shows a different perspective of how women can dress.
Monáe's signature style is hertuxedowardrobe. She said "I bathe in it, I swim in it, and I could be buried in it. A tux is such a standard uniform, it's so classy and it's a lifestyle I enjoy. The tux keeps me balanced. I look at myself as a canvas. I don't want to cloud myself with too many colors or I'll go crazy. It's an experiment I'm doing. I think I want to be in the Guinness Book of World Records."[143]Monáe's signature look harkens back todandyism.[144]CitingGrace JonesandJosephine Bakeras role models, Monáe takes the classical 18th-century look in the classical white and black pattern.[145]Monáe's signature look can also be attributed to the early days in her career, when she was employed as a maid. She mentioned this in her acceptance speech for the "Young, Gifted, and Black" award at the 2012Black Girls Rock!ceremony.[146]Monáe has been known to distribute theTen Droid Commandments, which encourages her fans to be individuals.[137]The Telegraphalso commented on her image as an artist, saying, "Sitting in a grey, airless record company office, this slight, stiff young woman delivers her speech in slow, deliberate tones, utterly expressionless. Dressed in her trademark starched shirt and tuxedo, hair immaculately coiffed, Monáe's face is an opaque mask of perfection: all silken smooth skin, button nose and glassy brown eyes."[132]Monáe describes tuxedos as a uniform for her career, speaks of wanting to redefine how women dress,[137]and has been featured in the "Style 100" ofInStylemagazine.[147]TheCouncil of Fashion Designers of America Awardshonored Monáe with the Board of Directors' Tribute and the American Ingenuity Award for her "straoridanra ability to experiment in fashion".[148][149]
When it comes to her acting career, Monáe expressed desire to shape it around that ofJohnny Depp, stating that he has a very vast career: "The amount of roles:Willy WonkatoSweeney Toddto all of the dramatic roles. Whatever the Janelle Monáe version of that is. Maybe something even better..."[150]
During a 2011 interview withLondon Evening Standard, Monáe said she "only dates androids", a reference to her musical alter ego found in many of her songs. She also said, "I speak about androids because I think the android represents the new 'other'. You can compare it to being a lesbian or being a gay man or being a Black woman... what I want is for people who feel oppressed or feel like the 'other' to connect with the music and to feel like, 'She represents who I am.'" She added that she would talk about her sexual orientation "in due time".[141]In 2013, Monáe said she wants both men and women to "still be attracted to [her]" and expressed support for theLGBTQ community.[151]
Monáe has said she identifies with bothbisexualityandpansexuality.[23]On January 10, 2020, shetweetedthehashtag#IAmNonbinary, along with a quoted tweet, which trended on Twitter that day.[152][153]Monáe said in an interview withThe Cuta month after the tweet that "I tweeted the #IAmNonbinary hashtag in support of Nonbinary Day and to bring more awareness to the community. I retweeted theSteven Universememe 'Are you a boy or a girl? I'm an experience' because it resonated with me, especially as someone who has pushed boundaries of gender since the beginning of my career. I feel my feminine energy, my masculine energy, and energy I can't even explain."[154]
In April 2022, shecame outpublicly asnon-binaryon theRed Table Talksaying, "I'm nonbinary, so I just don't see myself as a woman, solely... I feel like god is so much bigger than the 'he' or the 'she.' And if I am from God, I am everything."[155]In the interview, she also acknowledged having been in bothmonogamousandpolyamorousrelationships.[155]Following the interview, a representative of Monáe said that she "continues to use she/her pronouns."[156]In an interview with theLos Angeles Times, however, Monáe identified herself as non-binary and added that her "pronouns are free-ass motherfucker—and they/them, her/she."[157][158]
