When presented with the opportunity to kiss Brixlee at a party hosted by popular student Soren, Max and his friends use his father's valueddroneto spy on his teenage neighbor Hannah in an attempt to learn proper kissing. The plan goes wrong and results in the drone being destroyed and the boys in possession of Hannah'secstasy. To avoid getting grounded, they cut school to buy a new drone at the local mall, with Hannah and her friend Lily in pursuit.
Amid a series of escapades (including Lucas's arm getting dislocated and he, Max and Thor running through freeway traffic), the boys finally reach the mall, but they learn that Hannah and Lily bought the drone and will only give it to the boys in exchange for their ecstasy. Having surrendered the drugs to a police officer, they manage to obtain new ecstasy from Hannah's ex-boyfriend Benji in a frat house. But then, a fight breaks out between and after they escape the frat house, they trade the drugs for the drone.
Nevertheless, Max is unable to prevent his father from finding out that he used the drone and is grounded.

When Lucas speaks to his parents about the potential end of his friendships, they advise him that he, Max, and Thor are growing apart.
That night, Lucas convinces Max to sneak out to attend the party, tricking him into meeting up with Thor in the process. Max successfully kisses Brixlee while Thor and Lucas re-encounter Hannah and Lily, the latter revealed as Soren's sister, who encourage Thor to continue his passion for singing. In the ensuing weeks, Thor lands the role of Stacee Jaxx in the school's amateur production ofRock of Ages, Lucas joins the school's anti-bullying group, and Max begins dating his classmate Scout after his relationships with Brixlee and then her friend Taylor end in heartbreak.

On August 16, 2017, it was announced thatSeth Rogen'sPoint Grey PicturesandGood Universewould produce a comedy film by writersLee EisenbergandGene Stupnitskyin their directorial debuts. The film was produced by Rogen,Evan Goldberg, James Weaver,Nathan KahaneandJoe Drake.[7]In March 2018,Jacob Tremblaywas cast in the film, titledGood Boys, to whichUniversal Picturesbought the distribution rights.[8]
The film was shot inVancouver,Maple Ridge,Surrey,Langley, andAbbotsfordin British Columbia, Canada.[9]Stupnitsky received sole director credit.
Jonathan Furmanski, who had worked onSearch Party,Inside Amy Schumer, andThe Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling, was enlisted as the film's cinematographer. He took inspiration fromStand By Me,The Goonies, andE.T., aiming to have "one foot in 2019 and the other in 1986 (Stand By Me's release date)." He arrived at Vancouver a month before principal photography, allowing him to discuss more about the style of the film. The "universal agreement" is thatGood Boysshouldn't look like a "typical" pre-teen comedy, that it should feel "bigger and more open" despite its tight premise.[10]
Furmanski filmedGood BoyswithArriAlexa SXTandAlexa Minicameras equipped with Arri Master Anamorphic lenses. The 2.39:1anamorphicaspect ratio was used to achieve the wide scope of the film; Furmanski explained the Master Anamorphics were "the perfect choice: a big look, great contrast and color rendition, lovely depth and separation, and clean and sharp across the frame." To avoid making the set overheated andclaustrophobic, lights were kept out of the room or rigged overhead. He said that the scene where the boyspaintball-fight with grown-ups was shot in one take.[11]
The "biggest" and most challenging scene Furmanski shot was the scene of the boys running across the highway, using multiple units and taking over five days to achieve:[10]three days of filming and two days of stunt and visual effects. Almost every shot in the scene featured visual effects.[10]It was shot at a makeshift 300-foot highway on an unused airportrunway; the crew were not able to film at a real highway due to active traffic.[12]He creditedfirst assistant directorDan Miller andkey gripMarc Nolet for achieving the scene. According to Furmanski, Nolet "drilled smallwashersinto the tarmac for every camera position and we took copious notes so we could go back if necessary, orsecond unitcould come in and replicate something."[10]
The film had its world premiere atSouth by Southwestin Austin, Texas. on March 11, 2019.[13]Good Boyswas theatrically released on August 16, 2019, byUniversal Pictures, and became generally available on December 13, 2019.[14]
Good Boyswas released onDigital HDon October 29, 2019, and on DVD andBlu-rayon November 12, 2019.[15]

OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 246 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Good Boysis undermined by an eagerness to repeatedly indulge in profane humor, but its appealing cast and ultimately thoughtful message often shine through."[21]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 60 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[22]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an 83% overall positive score, with 61% saying they would definitely recommend it.[18]
CriticRichard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film a rating of three stars out of four, who commented that "for all its wacky, gross-out, shock-ya humor,Good Boyshas a lot of heart."[23]TwoNational Reviewwriters share slightly opposing views.Kyle Smithopined it as "engaging" in its mish-mash of innocence and naughtiness. He called the film a good depiction of juvenile delinquency, noting however its predictability and nonsensical humor, and calling it "so thin on plot that, even at 90 minutes, things feel a bit stretched."[24]Meanwhile,Armond Whitesaid that the film has a "rush-to-perdition premise", marking it a "step down fromFreaks and GeeksandSuperbad". He looked on the main characters as "the worst example of media brats", and the film's ambition to make it as profane as possible made for a hypocritical and "smut-peddling" work. He called the scene of Thor performingRock of Ages"the single most mawkish and dishonest movie ending so far this year."[25]
The film was nominated at thePeople's Choice Awardsin the "Favorite Comedy Movie of 2019" category, but lost toMurder Mystery.[26]

Orville Willis Forte IV[3]was born inAlameda, California, on June 17, 1970.[4]The son of artist and former schoolteacher Patricia C. (néeStivers)[5][6]and financial broker Orville Willis "Reb" Forte III.[3]He grew up inMoragabefore moving toLafayetteat age 13.[7]He went by "Billy" in his early years until he was teased at school for it also being a girl's name. At that point he decided he would from then on be known as "Will".[8]Forte described himself as having been a "really happy little boy" whose parents were "wonderful" and created a "very loving environment".[9]He was interested in comedy from a young age, growing up idolizing comediansPeter Sellers,David Letterman, andSteve Martinas well as the sketch-comedy television seriesSaturday Night Live.[10]He often pulled pranks on his parents,[10]and would record himself performing imaginary radio shows. He did not aim to be a comedian, but initially wanted to become afootballplayer.[9]
Forte was "a laid-back teen with a lot of friends", and a member of the varsity football and swim teams atAcalanes High Schoolin Lafayette where he graduated in 1988. He was voted "Best Personality" by his graduating class and served as freshman class president.[8][11]He had no ambitions for a television or film career, though his mother noticed a "creative streak" in him. After high school, he attended theUniversity of California, Los Angeles, where he was a member of theLambda Chi Alphafraternity and completed a degree in history.[12]Forte wanted to become a financial broker like his father atSmith Barney Shearson, but felt "miserable" there.[8]He co-wrote a feature-length script while there,[9]and later said that he discovered he loved writing "more than anything [he] had ever done in [his] life".[8]He had been encouraged to attempt comedy during his years at university, and he decided to change his career path to do so.[13]
Forte began taking classes atThe GroundlingsinLos Angeles, animprovisationalandsketch comedytroupe and school, while tutoring children to make ends meet. His first successful foray into comedy was101 Things to Definitely Not Do If You Want to Get a Chick, acomic bookhe produced about incompetent men.[10]The comics landed him his first professional job writing forThe Jenny McCarthy Show, a short-livedvariety showstarringJenny McCarthy. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to submit a packet to theLate Show with David Lettermanand was told Letterman responded favorably to animation.[10]After only nine months atLetterman, he was "let go" from the job. He recalled his stint on the program as unpleasant, noting that he did not have enough experience in writing.[14]"What an honor to work at that show but I don't think I was fully mentally prepared. [...] I always wonder what it would be like if I'd had a couple more years of experience before going there."[15]
Forte left New York and returned to Los Angeles, where he began performing with the Groundlings' Main Company, withCheryl Hines,Jim Rash, andMaya Rudolph.[9]He triedstand-up comedythree times, mostly at open mic nights, but quit after being voted into the Main Company.[9]He joined the writing teams of two failed sitcoms, includingThe Army ShowandAction. Forte got jobs writing for3rd Rock from the SunandThat '70s Show. He loved writing and had mostly given up on acting, aside from acting with the Groundlings.[9]While performing with the troupe in 2001, he was spotted byLorne Michaels, the creator ofSaturday Night Live(SNL). Forte felt his confidence was higher than usual, asThat '70s Showhad been picked up for two more years.[9]He was invited to audition forSNL, which he regarded as unexpected.[14]
At his audition forSNL, he performed multiple original characters, includingTim Calhoun, a speed reader, a prison guard, in addition to impressions of singerMichael McDonaldand actorMartin Sheen.[9]His final character was an older piece from his days with the Groundlings, in which he portrays a gold-painted street performer who performsfellatioto pay for his face paint, which devolves into a song needlessly uttering the words "cock" and "face paint" dozens of times.[14]He felt his time to shine as a performer was already over, as he was in his thirties when he auditioned.[8]To his surprise, he was offered a chance to be on the show, but declined, opting instead for the financial stability of his work atThat '70s Show.[16]He felt working forSNLcould not live up to the idealized version he had dreamed of, but he later realized he would be making a mistake.[15][17]
AfterWill FerrellleftSaturday Night Livethe following spring, Forte joined the cast, premiering at the beginning of the show'stwenty-eighth seasonin the autumn. He was promoted to repertory player after his first year.[13]His early years on the program were characterized bystage frightand an inability to properly interpret sketches that he did not write himself.[17]He had to "re-learn" how to perform after years as a writer, and later felt his natural tendency to "overthink" things improved his performance.[15]He was particularly uncomfortable portraying PresidentGeorge W. Bush, as he felt he was not the best impressionist and it paled in comparison to Ferrell's impersonation of Bush.[18]His only role was often Bush, leaving him no chance for more "absurd" pieces he favored. He was nearly fired from the program following his third season (2004–05), but after two three-week extensions to decide his fate, he was brought back.[17]Forte estimated it took five seasons for him to feel fully comfortable performing on the show.[19]He made his film debut inAround the World in 80 Days.[20]
"I've always liked weirder stuff. My main thing onSNLwas that I was never gonna change my sensibility to get on TV—I was just gonna write what I liked writing and hopefully have a hit on that show somewhere."
His humor atSNLhas been described as bizarre,[14]and he became known for many "10-to-1" sketches—pieces that were considered odd, placed at the very end of the show. He was also well known for his charactersTim Calhoun,Greg Stink, andthe Falconer. Forte's favorite sketch on the show was one in which he played a motivational coach alongside football starPeyton Manning.[13]He also co-starred withAndy Sambergin the firstSNLDigital Short, "Lettuce". He often spent long hours crafting his sketches for the program, missing deadlines, but his pieces were usually received warmly attable reads.[16][17]During his time at the show, he co-starred in and wrote the 2007 filmThe Brothers Solomon. The film was originally a pilot forCarsey-Werner, and its creation was an extension of his agreement to terminate his contract to appear onSNL.[21]
Forte's best-known character onSNLwasMacGruber, aspecial operationsagent who is tasked in each episode with deactivating a ticking bomb but becomes distracted by personal issues. The sketches were based on the television seriesMacGyver. It was created by writerJorma Taccone, who relentlessly pitched the idea to Forte.[18]He was initially reluctant to commit to the sketch, deeming it too dumb, but accepted after persuasion from Taccone.[22]The first sketch aired in January 2007, and led to multiple more segments in the following years. In 2009, the sketches were spun off into a series of commercials sponsored byPepsipremiering duringSuper Bowl XLIIIwhich featured the actor behind MacGyver,Richard Dean Anderson, as MacGruber's father. The advertisements led the character and sketches to receive a wider level of popularity.[22]After the success of the advertisements, creatorLorne Michaelsapproached Forte, Taccone, and writer John Solomon with the idea to produce aMacGruberfilm.[23]
Regarding his experiences onSNL, Forte remarked, "Looking back, the experience is something I'll never forget. I still miss it, and I'll always miss it. That's my family."[19]His celebrity impressions includedGeorge W. Bush,Tom DeLay,John Edwards,Timothy Geithner,Newt Gingrich,Chad Lowe,Zell Miller,David Petraeus,Harry Reid,Brian Williams, andHu Jintao.[24]
In the summer of 2009,MacGruberwas shot on a tight schedule for four weeks inAlbuquerque, New Mexico.[22][25]It was written while simultaneously producing the weekly episode ofSNL, and the show'sproduction processleft the trio deprived of sleep.[26]Forte was positive regarding the film, saying,
What you see with this movie is exactly what we wanted to do. It's the three of us having a bunch of fun writing it, then having fun making it with a bunch of our friends—old friends and new friends. I think that fun comes across when you watch it. It's rare that you get that kind of creative freedom.[18]
The film was released in May 2010 and received mixed reviews.[27]It fared worse at the box office, where it failed to recoup its budget and was pulled from theaters after its third week.[28]Forte found the failure tolerable, commenting, "When you make something that you're really proud of and it doesn't do well, you can live with it."[17]The film has since seen more of a positive reception and has been dubbed acult classic.[29][30]
Forte leftSaturday Night Liveshortly before the beginning of the show'sthirty-sixth seasonin 2010. He felt it was the "right time to go", considering his eight-year tenure there, his expansion into film withMacGruber, and his age. In addition, his sister had just had children and he wanted to move to the West Coast to be closer to them.[13]He soon regretted the decision, calling the following year an "emotionally trying period", as he felt "devastated" that he would no longer be on the program.[10]He assumed his shot at a film career was ruined,[17]and he imagined that if acting did not work out, he would return to mostly writing.[10]Afterwards he entered what he has called a "lost period"[14]and had small supporting roles, such asRock of Ages,That's My Boy,andThe Watch, all of which were not successful.[14]The only commercial successful film which he worked on wasGrown Ups 2, where he made acameoas a male cheerleader.[14]He also took a role asPaul L'astnamé, the cross-dressing boyfriend ofJenna Maroneyon the critically acclaimed sitcom30 Rock.[14]
Forte took his first dramatic role for the 2013 filmRun & Jump. DirectorSteph Greenoffered him the part, and Forte imagined it a "fun thing to try", though he noted that she had more confidence in him than he had himself.[13]Later, he sent an audition tape toAlexander Paynefor a role in his next film,Nebraska.[13]He equated his casting in the film to his fear of joiningSNLa decade prior, noting that he was "terrified" to begin working on it.[14]He felt scared initially, but followedBruce Dern's acting advice to "look for the truth" in each scene—in other words, "In every scene, you're just trying to play it as honestly and as real as you can."[15]
Forte began working onThe Last Man on Earth, a sitcom, with longtime collaboratorsPhil Lord and Christopher Millerin 2013. Though it was the duo's idea, Forte attached himself to the concept, crafting atreatmentover a weekend. The series waspitchedaroundHollywoodto positive responses and was picked up in 2014 byFox.[31]Forte served as the series' creator, a writer, the lead role, and showrunner for the first season. He felt odd being in charge of its writing team (composed of longtime friends), and awkward at delegating tasks, so much so that he would end up doing the work himself.[15]Being a showrunner "truly was an amount of work I never knew existed," he said, which involved him working a "minimum of 12 hours" daily.[32]The series premiered in 2015 to positive responses,[33]and was renewed for the next three seasons.[34]
In 2016, Forte played Hulka, a low-level weed dealer, in the comedyKeanu, starringJordan PeeleandKeegan-Michael Key.[35]In 2018, he playedNational Lampoonmagazine co-founderDouglas Kenneyin theNetflixbiographical filmA Futile and Stupid Gesture.[36]The film was directed byDavid Wainand featuresDomhnall Gleesonas co-founderHenry Beard.[37]Forte voicedShaggy Rogersin theScooby-DoofilmScoob!.[38]In 2021, Forte starred inSweet Tooth, reprised his role as MacGruber in aTV seriesonPeacock, and began voicing Wolf Tobin in the animated sitcomThe Great North. In 2022, it was announced that Forte had a leading role for Disney and Pixar's first animated television seriesWin or Lose. It is set to premiere on Disney+ in 2025.[39]He voiced an older version of the titular character inScott Pilgrim Takes Off. In 2024, Forte was announced in the main role of Martin inSunny Nights.[40]
Forte dated hisLast Man on Earthco-starJanuary Jonesin 2015.[41]He and Olivia Modling were engaged in 2019; they met in 2018.[41]They have two daughters Zoe Douglas Forte, born in February 2021, and Cecilia, born approximately 18 months later.[42]He and Modling married on July 31, 2021.[43]They live in a modestly sized Craftsman home inSanta Monica, California. Forte bought the home in 2002, just two weeks before joining the cast ofSaturday Night Livewhich required him to move toNew York City. He admitted later that "it was not the greatest timing."[5]
Forte's mother, Patricia has visited every film set on which he has worked and made an appearance on aMother's Dayepisode ofSNL, in which he sang a song to her onWeekend Update. Will  officiated his sister Michelle's wedding; he filmed the birth of his niece and nephew.[44]
Will Forte has discussed and joked about hisOCDtendencies.[45][5]He recounted listening to only one song in his office atSNLfor an entire year because he wanted to challenge himself.[46]During an interview withLarry King, he discussed his OCD as a challenge he had to overcome but not one he wished he did not have, as it is a part of his personality.[47][48]In a February 2015 article onGrantlandthe writer of the article said that Forte mentioned OCD often but it was not clear if he had ever been formally diagnosed, though Forte related how he and a former girlfriend had gone through an OCD questionnaire and it concluded that Forte "should immediately talk to someone about this".[45]
Forte is an avid gamer. While filmingA Good Old-Fashioned Orgy, he achieved one of the world's highest scores on the arcade version ofDonkey Kong.[49]
