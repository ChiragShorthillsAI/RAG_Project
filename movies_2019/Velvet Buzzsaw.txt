Velvet Buzzsawis a 2019 Americansatiricalblack comedyhorror filmdirected and written byDan Gilroyand starringJake Gyllenhaal,Zawe Ashton,Rene Russo,Toni Collette,Daveed Diggs,Tom Sturridge,Natalia Dyer,Billy Magnussen, andJohn Malkovich. The film had its world premiere at the2019 Sundance Film Festivalon January 27.
In Miami,art criticMorf Vandewalt attends an art exhibition alongside his friend Josephina, who works for Rhodora Haze, owner of the Haze Gallery and formerly a member of the punk rock band Velvet Buzzsaw. Unfulfilled in his love life with his boyfriend Ed, Morf starts a sexual relationship with Josephina.
Returning to Los Angeles, Josephina finds a dead man named Vetril Dease in her apartment building and enters his home to discover a myriad of paintings, some of which are partially destroyed. Josephina steals the paintings to show Morf and Rhodora, who become fascinated with Dease. Rhodora decides to exhibit several of Dease's pieces in her gallery to great success. The artworks also enchant Gretchen, Morf's art curator friend; Piers, a former artist for the Haze Gallery; and Damrish, an up-and-coming artist.
To ensure the rarity of the paintings, Rhodora orders gallery worker Bryson to transport half of them to storage. En route, a painting catches fire from his cigarette ash and burns him, causing him to crash into a seemingly abandonedgas station. After he heads inside to clean the burns, Bryson is dragged into a painting by a group of monkey mechanics. Outside, his truck catches fire and burns the remaining Dease paintings.
Researching Dease, Morf discovers he suffered from an abusive childhood that culminated in the murder of his father, after which he was sent to apsychiatric hospitalfor human experimentation, adding to his mental illness. Jon Dondon, a rival art gallery owner, hires aprivate investigatorto uncover the same story. He attempts to reveal Dease's story to the press but is murdered when a mysterious hand hangs him by his scarf. Coco, Rhodora's former assistant who had just begun working for Jon, discovers his body.
Morf sees a hand in a Dease painting suddenly move; his vision is cleared by hisoptometristbut he continues to hallucinate. That night, he visits the gallery archivist and learns Dease used blood to make his red-black paints. Rhodora, disappointed with Piers' most recent work, sends him to live at her beach house and not return until he has made art only for himself.
Gretchen negotiates the display of some Dease paintings in the city'smuseumalongside an interactive piece titledSphere, which is owned by Gretchen's primary client. Meanwhile, Gretchen also sabotages Josephina's relationship with Morf by telling her he still has feelings for Ed. The night before the exhibit's debut, Gretchen sticks her arm in one of the holes inSpherewhich malfunctions and severs her arm, leaving her to bleed out. Coco, who had recently become Gretchen's assistant, finds her body the next morning. Despite, or perhaps because of, Gretchen's death, there is a spike in interest and demand for the Dease exhibit. Morf and Josephina break up after he finds out she is dating Damrish.
Morf's visions worsen, and he urges Rhodora to stop selling Dease's artwork. She ignores him and, knowing he will write a negative article about the artworks, tries to sell them off as fast as she can for tens of millions of dollars. Morf hires the again unemployed Coco to dispose of the artworks. At a dive bar, Damrish informs Josephina he will not display his art with Haze Gallery, and they break up. Outside, Josephina is mysteriously transported to a gallery where thegraffitipaintings melt around her and envelop her skin. As Morf puts the Dease artworks into his storage unit, he discovers a deactivatedHoboman, a robotic art piece he had given a negative critique.Hobomansprings to life and chases Morf into a dead end where it breaks Morf's neck, despite Morf's pleas for mercy.
The next morning, Coco finds Morf's body while Josephina's terrified image is seen on a wall of graffiti. Rhodora, now believing the deaths are connected to Dease, has all the artwork in her house removed. As she sits outside her house, thebuzz sawtattoo on her neck begins spinning and slashes her flesh, killing her. On the way toLAX, returning home toMichigan, Coco passes a street vendor selling Dease's paintings for five dollars apiece, having found one of the boxes from Bryson's truck. Meanwhile, Piers draws a pattern of curves on the beach sand as the waves wash over them.
Dan Gilroyconceived the project afterSuperman Lives, a film which he had a hand in developing, was abruptly cancelled becauseWarner Bros.was not willing to produce it due to the large budget. He felt that he had wasted a year and a half on the film, but he ultimately made peace with the idea while sitting on a beach, a moment that inspired the final scene in the film.[5]In June 2017, it was announcedJake GyllenhaalandRene Russohad been cast in Gilroy's then untitled film, with him writing and directing the film, whileJennifer Foxwould serve as a producer, andNetflixwould produce and distribute the film.[6][7]Speaking withBusiness Insiderin November 2017, Gilroy teased the project saying:
It's set in the world of contemporary art in Los Angeles, and its got aRobert Altman-like largeensemble cast. It's got aThe Playervibe to it. There's a large cast and we're moving around from person to person as we move through this world. The story is being told through these different characters.[8]
In January 2018, it was announced the title wasVelvet Buzzsaw.[9]In March 2018,Zawe Ashton,Natalia Dyer,Tom Sturridge,Daveed Diggs,Toni Collette,John MalkovichandBilly Magnussenjoined the cast of the film.[10][11]
Principal photography began on March 5, 2018, in Los Angeles, California.[12]
Marco BeltramiandBuck Sanderscomposed the score for the film, replacing Gilroy's frequent collaboratorJames Newton Howard.
Director Dan Gilroy has stated that he wrote the Morf Vandewalt character to besexually fluidbecause he "believe[s] that sexuality is far more fluid than society does."[13]
Velvet Buzzsawhad its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 27, 2019.[14]It was released by Netflix on February 1, 2019.[15]
Rotten Tomatoesreports an approval rating of 61% based on 198 reviews, and an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "If you only watch one art-world satire with horror overtones this year — or most others — it should probably beVelvet Buzzsaw."[16]On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[17]
Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comgave the film two and a half out of four stars, writing: "It's a wildly inconsistent film, sometimes disappointingly clunky and as superficial as the world it's mocking, but it's also an ambitious piece of work with unforgettable imagery and an ace ensemble."[18]Emily Yoshida ofVulturewrote: "Writer and director Dan Gilroy is drawing from the same well of a bitter, morally compromised Los Angeles that he did for 2014'sNightcrawler, butVelvet Buzzsaw, as gleaming and sun-drenched asNightcrawleris dark, is even more of an invective, and even more operatically heightened."[19]Peter Debruge ofVarietycalled it "[Gilroy's] most cynical movie yet, with most of the venom concentrated in the character of the critic."[20]David Ehrlich ofIndieWiregave the film a grade of C, writing "Gilroy's film needed to be 60% better or 20% worse in order to transcend the forgettable silliness of its existence, but it could stand the test of time as a lasting monument to the idea that our own personal taste is the only real thing we ever had."[21]

She made her film debut in the 1989 comedyMajor League, and rose to international prominence in a number of thrillers and action films throughout the 1990s, includingLethal Weapon 3(1992),In the Line of Fire(1993),Outbreak(1995),Get Shorty(1995),Ransom(1996),Lethal Weapon 4(1998), andThe Thomas Crown Affair(1999).
After headlining the family comedyYours, Mine & Ours(2005), Russo took a five-year break from acting. She returned to the screen asFrigga, the mother of the titular hero, in the superhero filmThor(2011), a role she reprised inThor: The Dark World(2013) andAvengers: Endgame(2019). In 2014, Russo starred in the acclaimed crime thrillerNightcrawler, for which she won theSaturn Award for Best Supporting Actressand was nominated for theBAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.[2]She has also appeared inThe Intern(2015),Just Getting Started(2017), andVelvet Buzzsaw(2019).
Russo was born in 1954 inBurbank, California, to Shirley (née Balocca), a factory worker and barmaid, and Nino Russo, a sculptor and car mechanic who left the family when Russo was two.[3][4][5]Russo hasItalianancestry.[6][7]Russo grew up with her mother and her sister, Toni (who was married to lyricistBernie Taupinbetween 1979 and 1991),[8]and attendedBurroughs High School, where her classmates included directorRon Howard. She was afflicted withscoliosisand had to wear a full-torso brace. Her height also earned her the nickname "Jolly Green Giant" from her classmates.[9]In a 2019 interview withFinancial Times, she indeed described herself as a "geek", and admitted that the bullying she endured during high school made her drop out in thetenth grade.[10]Growing up, Russo did not have any "ambitions", remarking that she "was too busy just trying to survive, along with my sister and my mom —money was tight, my mom worked two jobs".[10]She began taking a variety of part-time jobs to help her family, including working in an eyeglass factory and as a movie theater cashier.[10]She eventually got scouted for modelling and went toNew York City, which she described as a "scary place compared to where I grew up".[10]
After allegedly being spotted at a 1972Rolling Stonesconcert by John Crosby, an agent fromInternational Creative Management,[11]Russo originally began her career as a model. With Crosby's encouragement, Russo applied to, and was signed by,Ford Modeling Agency. She became one of the top models of the 1970s and early 1980s,[12]appearing on magazine covers forVogue,Mademoiselle, andCosmopolitan, as well as advertisements for perfume and cosmetics.[13]Voguein a 2016 article, wrote: "In the '70s, Russo stood for a sexiness that was both accessible and aspirational: She could vamp it up with the best of them, posing forFrancesco Scavulloin decadent furs, or swathed inVersaceforRichard Avedon, but Russo wasn't your average pinup. The poise she brought to her images made her the first choice for editorial shoots that demanded models with tenacity, whether she was bound for the boardroom in a power suit or posing on a beach with Tony Spinelli".[13]
Modeling assignments began to wane for Russo as she entered her 30s. She did a few more commercials and then turned her back on modeling for a period of time. She studied theater and acting, and began appearing in theater roles at small theaters in Los Angeles and elsewhere in California. At one point, she took acting lessons from veteran actorAllan Rich, whom she credits with introducing her to the craft of acting.[14]Russo made her debut in a television series in 1987, with a supporting role in the short-lived ABC productionSable,based on the comic book,Jon Sable: FreelancebyMike Grell. She made her feature film debut as the girlfriend of a former baseball star inMajor League, a comedy written and directed byDavid S. Ward. The film was a critical success.[15]
In 1990, Russo appeared in the fantasy comedy filmMr. Destiny, withJim Belushi, playing the wife in what was an alternate reality of an ordinary guy's life. In 1991, she had her first leading film role inOne Good Cop, as the wife of aNew York City Police Departmentdetective (played byMichael Keaton). In 1992, Russo achieved breakout success with her role as internal affairs detective Lorna Cole, oppositeMel GibsonandDanny Glover, in the action filmLethal Weapon 3.[16]The film made US$320 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 1992 and the highest-grossing film in theLethal Weaponfilm series.[17]Her other 1992 film release was the science fiction filmFreejack, which despite an overall negative response, earned Russo a nomination for theSaturn Award for Best Supporting Actress.
Throughout the 1990s, Russo took on major roles in a number of commercially and critically successful films. In 1993, she starred withClint Eastwoodin the thriller filmIn the Line of Fire,directed byWolfgang Petersen, playing a federal agent involved with the sole active-duty Secret Service agent remaining from the detail guardingJohn F. KennedyinDallas,Texas, at the time of hisassassinationin 1963. The film made US$176.9 million globally,[18]and received threeAcademy Awardsnominations.[19]In 1995, Petersen cast her as a medical doctor, who uncovers a newly discoveredEbola-like virus which came to the United States from Africa in an infected monkey, in the medical disaster filmOutbreak, withDustin Hoffman.[20]The film grossed over US$189 million worldwide.[17]She starred as a B movie actress, oppositeJohn Travolta, in the crime comedyGet Shorty,directed byBarry Sonnenfeld.

CriticKenneth Turan, in his review for the film, wrote: "[Her] smart, gritty performance is the best thing about this remake of the stylish caper movieThomas Crown."[25]The production grossed US$124.3 million worldwide.[17]
In 2000, Russo obtained the role of villainNatasha Fatale, oppositeRobert De NiroandPiper Perabo, in the adventure comedyThe Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, directed byDes McAnuffand based on thetelevisioncartoonof the same namebyJay Ward. The film received mixed reviews from critics and went largely unnoticed at the box office.[26]For her portrayal, she received aSaturn Awardnomination forBest Supporting Actress,[27]and conversely, aRazzie Awardnomination for Worst Supporting Actress.[28]She reunited with De Niro to play the producer of a reality police show in the comedyShowtime(2002), also starringEddie Murphy.

The comedyBig Trouble, which was based on the novel byDave Barryand featured her as a devoted mother, was originally scheduled for release on September 21, 2001, and had a strong advertising push. The events ofSeptember 11of that year cast a pall over the movie's comedic smuggling of a nuclear device onto an airplane. Consequently, the film was pushed back until 2002, and the promotion campaign was toned down almost to the point of abandonment. The film came to theaters and left quickly afterwards, without generating much of an impact.[30]
Russo starred in and produced the filmTwo for the Money(2005), withAl PacinoandMatthew McConaughey, playing the wife of a sports gambling agent. InYours, Mine & Ours(also 2005), Russo starred withDennis Quaid, as a widowed handbag designer with ten kids.Film Journal Internationalfelt that the "secret to the film's modest success can be summed up" in Russo and Quaid's performances,[31]andDaily Radarwrote that "the able-bodied actors fulfill the slapstick demands of this run-of-the-mill family comedy".[32]Despite receiving overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics,[33]the film made over US$72 million worldwide and marked her only commercial success in the decade.[17]Following its release, Russo took a five-year hiatus from acting, opting to focus on her health and personal life.[34]
In 2010, Russo returned to the screen in the superhero filmThor, released in 2011, after being persuaded by directorKenneth Branaghin December 2009, who asked her to portrayFrigga, the mother of the titular hero.[35]However, most of her scenes were removed in editing. She received more screen time inThor: The Dark World(2013). She credited those films, which made more than US$1 billion combined,[36]with introducing her to a new generation of filmgoers. "The funny thing is now I have kids coming up to me, and I'm thinking, 'how do you know my movies?' And they say, 'That'sThor's mummy'."[37]
In 2014, Russo appeared as a morning news director, alongsideJake Gyllenhaal, in the crime thrillerNightcrawler, written and directed by her husbandDan Gilroy.[38]The film was met with widespread praise and several critics listed it as one of the best films of 2014.[39]Indiewireasserted: "Russo is an integral part of the narrative and she gives as good as she gets. The role is easily her finest in several years and the rich material uncorks a wealth of inventiveness from the actress. There's not a lot of imaginatively drawn roles for aging women, but Russo sinks her teeth into the role of a coldblooded vampiress protective of her own uncertain hold in the newsroom."[40]Budgeted at US$8.5 million, the film grossed US$50.3 million.[41]
Russo portrayed a groupie and the mother of director G.J. Echternkamp in his independent comedyFrank and Cindy(2015), based on the 2007 documentary of the same name.[42]In 2015, she reunited once again with Robert De Niro, playing an in-house massage therapist and his love interest, in the comedyThe Intern, directed byNancy Meyers.[43]BothThe Washington PostandNew York Postfound her to be a highlight in her role,[44]and the film grossed US$194.6 million globally.[45]Russo starred withMorgan FreemanandTommy Lee Jonesin another comedy,Just Getting Started(2017), as the regional director of the luxury resort Villa Capri inPalm Springs, California.[46]Varietyfelt that the three actors "do little more than embarrass themselves here",[47]as part of an overall negative response.[48]
InVelvet Buzzsaw(2019), Russo worked again with Jake Gyllenhaal and Dan Gilroy, playing a tough art gallery owner haunted by the mysterious nature of a series of paintings by an unknown artist. The film was released byNetflix, to positive reviews.[49]She briefly reprised her role ofFriggainAvengers: Endgame.
Russo married screenwriterDan Gilroyon March 14, 1992.[50]They met while working on the filmFreejack(1992). They have one daughter, Rose, who has ventured into modelling,[51]and live inBrentwood, Los Angeles.
