Andre Davis, a successfulNYPDDetectivelike his father (who was murdered on duty when Andre was a child), struggles with his father's legacy and has earned a reputation for killing several criminals over the years, although he claims that they were all inself-defenseand is uncomfortable with the label.
One night, Michael Trujillo and Ray Jackson, two small-time criminals and ex-militarysoldiers, attempt to steal 30 kilograms ofcocainefrom awine shopinBrooklyn, but they find 300 kilograms of cocaine instead. When a group of officers from the NYPD's 85th Precinct arrives, Ray guns them down in a shootout, killing seven officers and wounding another, who later dies at a hospital. After Michael and Ray escape intoManhattanwith 50 kilograms, Michael chastises Ray for putting them in jeopardy by killing cops. Assigned to the case, Davis and NYPDNarcoticsDetective Frankie Burns come into conflict with Sgt. Butchco and Sgt. Dugan, who attempt to allowFBIspecial agentsto take over the case. Reasoning that the criminals would have to sell the cocaine in Manhattan before escaping thestate, Davis secures the reluctant approval of theDeputy Mayor, FBI and the precinct's headCaptainMcKenna for Manhattan Island to be under lockdown until 5:00 a.m.
As Ray and Michael go with their liaison Bush to meet their buyer Hawk, who gives them $1 million, Davis and Burns manage to identify all three of them. Bush is soon gunned down by Butchco and Dugan in a nightclub. After catching Butchcoplantinghis backup sidearm on Bush's body and briefly scuffling with him, Davis becomes more suspicious of his colleagues. Adi, amoney launderer, gives new identities to Michael and Ray and tells them to depart forMiami. However, before he can secure their money in anoffshore account, a team of NYPD officers led byLt.Kelly manages to locate and raid his apartment. Adi is mortally wounded, but gives Michael twoflash drivesand their password.
Davis and Burns catch up to Michael and Ray after accidentally killing a civilian, Ray is fatally wounded by Davis. Michael holds Burns at gunpoint, telling Davis about the drives and how suspicious everything is, before escaping. Burns scolds Davis for letting Michael escape despite Davis' reputation. In a hotel room, Michael unlocks the drives, realizing that McKenna's precinct was involved intrafficking the drugsfrom the winery and earning profits for it and that some of the cops he and Ray had killed in the shootout had beencorrupt. After another chase where Michael abandons his money, Davis manages to corner him on a subway train and convinces him to surrender, promising to keep him alive. Burns, who has also boarded the train, suddenly shoots Michael, claiming when he berates her that she thought Michael was still holding Davis at gunpoint. Michael secretly gives Davis the drives and password before dying. As the police congratulate the two for their efforts, Davis discovers that Burns had contacted Kelly before Adi's apartment was raided.
The next morning, McKenna returns home to find Davis holding him at gunpoint, having accessed the drives. McKenna explains that the officers went into drug trafficking because they were struggling to survive on a measly pay. Davis, refusing to walk away, kills the arriving Butchco, Dugan and Kelly – who were all on McKenna's payroll – and later kills McKenna, who refuses to surrender. Burns, whom Davis deduced was also allied with McKenna, appears from behind and holds Davis at gunpoint. She surrenders after Davis reveals that he has already leaked the information online, exposing all the corrupt cops in New York. He warns her that she will get life in prison for killing him, meaning that her daughter would have to grow up without her. Burns surrenders.
In the aftermath, Davis solemnly drives along theManhattan Bridgein the sunset, taking the drives with him.

In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014 (the "S" standing for Simonds, the company's founder; the "T" standing forTPG Growth, whose managing partner McGlashan helped launch the company; and the "X" standing for "secret project"),[2]with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[3][4]Investors in the company includedHony Capital,Tencent,PCCW, TPG Growth,RTL GroupandLiberty Global. Individual investors includeGigi Pritzker,Beau Wrigley, andDominic Ng.[5][6][7]
In September 2017, it was reported that STX was considering aninitial public offeringon theHong Kong Stock Exchange(SEHK).

Sienna Rose Diana Miller(born 28 December 1981)[1]is an American-British[2][3][4][5][6]actress. Born in New York City and raised in London, she began her career as a photography model, appearing in the pages of ItalianVogueand for the 2003Pirelli Calendar. Her acting breakthrough came in the 2004 filmsLayer CakeandAlfie. She subsequently portrayed socialiteEdie SedgwickinFactory Girl(2006) and authorCaitlin MacnamarainThe Edge of Love(2008), and was nominated for theBAFTA Rising Star Awardin 2008. Her role asThe BaronessinG.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra(2009) was followed by a brief sabbatical from the screen amid increased tabloid scrutiny.
Miller returned to prominence with her role as actressTippi Hedrenin the 2012 television filmThe Girl, for which she was nominated for theBAFTA Television Award for Best Actressand theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film. She has since starred in several notable films, includingFoxcatcher(2014),American Sniper(2014),The Lost City of Z(2016),Live by Night(2016), andAmerican Woman(2018), as well as the miniseriesThe Loudest Voice(2019) andAnatomy of a Scandal(2022).
Miller was born in New York City,[1]inThe Nutcracker Suitetheatre,[7]and moved to London with her family when she was 18 months old. She later boarded at theHeathfield SchoolinAscot, Berkshire.[8]Her father, Edwin Miller, is an American dealer in Chinese art, previously a banker. Her mother, Josephine, is a British former model who was born in South Africa to British parents and was a personal assistant toDavid Bowieand onetime manager of theLee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institutein New York.[9]
Miller's screen debut came in the romantic comedySouth Kensington(2001), oppositeRupert EverettandElle Macpherson. In 2002, she had supporting roles inHigh Speedand its follow-upThe Ride, and guest-starred inThe American EmbassyandBedtime. She had a regular role as the combative yet caring flatmate of anNYPDdetective in the television drama seriesKeen Eddie(2003). It was Miller's first exposure to American audiences. FOX cancelled it after only seven episodes.[10]
With roles in two commercial films and a higher public profile due to her relationship with actorJude Law, 2004 was a turning point for Miller's career. The crime thrillerLayer Cake, directed by Matthew Vaughn and starringDaniel Craig, featured her as the love interest of a London-based cocaine supplier.The New York Timescalled Miller "a newIt Girlwho barely registers on-screen despite wearing little more than lacey filaments that make her look like a gift meant to be unwrapped very quickly".[11]InAlfie, theremakeofBill Naughton's1966 film, she played the girlfriend of a cockney limo driver andsex addict(Jude Law). Of her It Girl status, she said at the time: "I'm not very happy about it, to be honest. It makes me uncomfortable because I don't think it's as a result of having a film come out, [but] being scrutinised because of the relationship I'm in".[12]
Miller portrayed a writer of illegal feminist books and the love interest ofGiacomo Casanova(Heath Ledger) in the 2005 period dramedyCasanova. It made $37.6 million, andEntertainment Weekly, in a favorable review, wrote: "Ms. Miller has a modern, smart-girl look about her; her Francesca is neither too tough to melt nor too glittering from theEmma Thompsonschool of smarties".[13]Also in 2005 she made herWest Enddebut in a revival ofAs You Like Itat theWyndhams Theatre, receiving lukewarm reviews. Paul Taylor ofThe Independentwrote: "She approaches an emotion with the finesse of someone beating a carpet" and that she "brings to it all the ripe professional stage experience that can be mustered from appearing in three movies".[14]
Miller took on the role of 1960ssocialiteandAndy Warhol's museEdie Sedgwickin the 2006 biographical dramaFactory Girl. Johnny Vaughan ofSunOnline concluded, "[i]t's Sienna Miller's star that shines brightest in this heartbreaking cautionary tale", butRotten Tomatoes' critical consensus reads: "Despite a dedicated performance by Sienna Miller,Factory Girldelves only superficially into her character, and ultimately fails to tell a coherent story."[15]In 2007, Miller had a role as the love interest of a young man from a fictional British town inMatthew Vaughn's adaptationStardust, and played a starlet inSteve Buscemi'sInterview, a remake of Dutch filmmakerTheo van Gogh's 2003movie of the same name. Budgeted at $65 million,Stardustgrossed $137 million worldwide, while critics felt that Buscemi's and Miller's "captivating performances" inInterviewmade "a seemingly simple premise gripping and entertaining".[16]
InThe Mysteries of Pittsburgh(2008), a film adaptation ofMichael Chabon'snovel,[17]Miller played a woman romantically involved with a rebellious bisexual man. It premiered at theSundance Film Festivaland received a limited release.[18]She created a minor stir inPittsburghwhen, in a 2006 interview withRolling Stone, she called the city "Shitsburgh", saying, "Can you believe this is my life? Will you pity me when you're back in your funky New York apartment and I'm still in Pittsburgh? I need to get more glamorous films and stop with my indie year."[19]Miller was parodied in Pittsburgh media (including one article headlined "Semi-famous actress dumps on the 'Burgh") and criticised for making what was seen as an unnecessarily disparaging remark, given the special treatment the film's cast and crew had received from the visitors' bureau and other city offices. Miller apologised and said her remarks were taken out of context.[20]
In the 2008 British biographical dramaThe Edge of Love,Miller appeared alongsideKeira KnightleyasCaitlin Macnamara, the wife of poetDylan Thomas. Despite a mixed critical reception,The Hollywood Reportercritic Ray Bennett wrote that it was a "wonderfully atmospheric tale of love and war", and that "the film belongs to the women, with Knightley going from strength to strength (and showing she can sing!) and Miller again proving that she has everything it takes to be a major movie star."[21]Miller earned aBIFAnomination forBest Supporting Actressfor her performance. She also voiced a circus fox in the animated filmA Fox's Tale(2008)[22]and played an undead newlywed in the romantic comedyCamille.[23]
Miller was cast asThe Baronessin the live-action film adaptation of theG.I. JoefranchiseG.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra(2009), her first—and to date, only—mainstream Hollywood blockbuster. She auditioned because it did not involve "having a breakdown or [being] addicted to heroin or dying at the end, something that was just maybe really great fun and that people went to see and actually just had a great time seeing."[24]She sprained her wrist after slipping on arubber bulletwhile filming a fight scene withRachel Nichols.G.I. Joewas not well received by most critics,[25]but made $302.5 million worldwide.[26]
She appeared on the UK motorsport showTop Gearin2009on the segment "star in a reasonably priced car" and set a lap time of 1:49.8, having passed her driving test only five days before.[27]
The Irish Independentobserved that Miller's professional trajectory had reached "its lowest ebb" withG.I. Joe, an experience that "convinced her she had well and truly lost her way"; in an interview withUK'sEsquiremagazine, she said that roles dried up because "people don't want to see films with people they don't approve of in them".[28][29]
She opted to take a hiatus from films for the next two years and work in theater instead.[29]She later said, "I was sick of myself, to be honest, or sick of that perception of me. It all felt so fucking dirt".[30]
In 2009, Miller played the title role inPatrick Marber'sAfter Miss Julieon Broadway.[31]She toldThe New York Times: "This is what I have always wanted, to be on Broadway. I'm living my dream, and that's all you can ask for. At a certain point, you have to ignore all the rest". On her performance,The Guardianstated: "Miller masters it intermittently—an accomplishment, however incomplete."[32]She starred as a former starlet caught up in a love-triangle inTrevor Nunn's 2011 production ofFlare Pathat London'sTheatre Royal Haymarket.[33]
After her professional slump, Miller experienced what journalists called a "career revival"[29]She played more complex, dramatic parts in a series of critically acclaimed films.[34]"All the directors speak to each other," she said in an interview. "And once you crack that upper echelon of incredible directors, you've got people rooting for you. People who people listen to. I've never had that before".[29]
InThe Girl(2012), anHBOandBBCfilm, Miller portrayed actressTippi Hedren, the muse of directorAlfred Hitchcock. As part of her research, Miller (who was in the early stages of pregnancy) spoke to Hedren several times during filming, and they became friends.[35]Live birds were used for the recreation of the attic scene in Hitchcock'sThe Birds. Miller told theRadio Times, "I did go through a bird attack for two hours. It pales in comparison to what [Hedren] was subjected to, but it was pretty horrible. There were men off-camera with boxes of birds, throwing seagulls and pigeons in my face".[36][37]The film received mixed reviews, but theDaily Mirror's Jane Simon wrote: "[G]liding gracefully through it all (and with an impeccable American accent) Sienna Miller brings untouchable beauty and icy glamour, but also captures the extraordinary resilience Hedren must have had to withstand everything Hitchcock threw at her." Writing forThe Telegraph,Clive Jamessaid "[a] better choice [to play Hedren] could not have been made than Sienna Miller, who is even lovelier than Hedren was".[38]She garnered nominations for theBAFTA Television Award for Best Actressand theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film. In 2012, she also played a socialite in thedramedyTwo Jacks, the hysterical sister of an elementary teacher in the dramaYellow, and a housewife who aspires to complete in a belly-dance competition in the made-for-television filmJust like a Woman.

Both films were highly acclaimed, andAmerican Sniperemerged as the highest-grossing war film of all time.[39]In 2015, she took on the roles of a prostitute in the road dramaMississippi Grind, the former boss of a hard-working small business owner in the comedyUnfinished Business, a single mother in the dystopian filmHigh-Rise, and that of asous-chefin the dramaBurnt, which reunited her with Bradley Cooper. ForHigh-Rise, she received a BIFA nomination for Best Supporting Actress.[40]Miller also took the role ofSally Bowlesin the Broadway revival ofCabaretafterEmma Stone's scheduled departure from the production and performed for the last six weeks of the show's engagement, in February and March 2015. TheNew York Daily Newspraised her "cocky and steely" performance and wrote that her approach to the role "works well in theKander and Ebbsongs 'Don't Tell Momma' and 'Perfectly Marvelous'."[41]She was selected to be on the jury for the main competition section of the2015 Cannes Film Festival.[42][43]
Miller appeared inParamount PicturesandPlan B Entertainment's adaptation ofThe Lost City of Z(2016), directed byJames Gray, portraying Nina Fawcett, the wife of British geographerPercy Fawcett.The New York Timescalled her "wonderful" in her role,[44]whileTimedescribed her as "luminous and astute".[45]InBen Affleck's period crime dramaLive by Night(2016), Miller played the mistress of a notorious gangster and the love interest of a World War I veteran.[46][47][48][49]In 2017, Miller starred in the dramaThe Private Life of a Modern Woman, which screened out of competition at the74th Venice International Film Festival,[50]and in a West End production of theTennessee WilliamsclassicCat On A Hot Tin Roof, at theApollo Theatre.[51]

I think it's quite rare; not necessarily specific to me, but at 37 years old, I'm thrilled I've had this opportunity. I've done good supporting work in fantastic films and had to work very hard to show something in smaller moments. I loved being able to have the space and time to really do everything I want to with a character".[52]
Miller starred as a narcotics detective in the 2019 action film21 BridgesalongsideChadwick Boseman.The Guardianwrote that she was "vocally channellingEdie FalcofromThe Sopranos",[53]and with a worldwide gross of $50 million, the film was a moderate commercial success. She next took the role of Beth Ailes, the wife of television executiveRoger Ailes(played byRussell Crowe), in the miniseriesThe Loudest Voice(2019), which aired onShowtime. Miller struggled to find material on which to base her performance aside from the script andGabriel Sherman's bookThe Loudest Voice in the Room. During an interview withEntertainment Weekly, she said: "There's very little footage of her that I had access to. But there were these two speeches which she gave, which were on YouTube, and another little interview, so I really kind of based my research around that, and relied on the script because there's just not a lot of information on her out there. But the interview and the speeches I found really revealing".[54]
In February 2024, she joined the short filmMarionas an executive producer.[55]
Before her professional acting career, Miller worked as a photography model.

In the late 2000s, Miller was better known for her tabloid persona and fashion sense than her professional work.The Irish Independentwrote in 2015 that "she was one of the most famous young actresses of her generation, but still boasted precious little credibility in the industry".[29]In a 2017 interview withThe Sydney Morning Herald, she said: "I definitely feel like I'm in a place now where people are more focused on my career than on my private life and clothes, which is refreshing. There's not the same drama around me that there was".[77]

I would often find myself almost daily, I was 21, at midnight running down a dark street on my own with 10 big men chasing me. The fact that they had cameras in their hands meant that was legal. But if you take away the cameras, what have you got? You've got a pack of men chasing a woman, and obviously that's a very intimidating situation to be in.
In November 2021, Miller accepted a financial settlement fromNews Group Newspapers, publishers ofThe Sun, over an alleged phone hacking claim. Her lawyerDavid Sherbornetold the court the payout is "tantamount" to an admission of illegal activity byThe Sun.[98]Outside the High Court on 9 December 2021, Miller said ofThe Sunnewspaper, "They very nearly ruined my life. I have certainly seen how they have ruined the lives of others."[98]
