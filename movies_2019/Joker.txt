Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]
Warner Bros. owns some shared universes. Some of them are based on books and comics, including some of the highest grossing IP's in the movie industry.

DC Studiosis an American film and television production company that is a division ofWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD). It is responsible for the production of live-action and animated films and television series, as well as video games, based on characters from theAmerican comic bookpublisherDC Comics, primarily as part of its flagshipmedia franchiseandshared universe, theDC Universe(DCU). The studio has been led by writer/directorJames Gunnand producerPeter Safranas its co-chairmen and co-CEOs since it was formed in November 2022.
The studio's predecessor,DC Films, was formed in May 2016 as a division ofWarner Bros. Picturesto oversee DC-based film productions, primarily those from its shared universe franchise theDC Extended Universe(DCEU). It was led by DC comic book and television writerGeoff Johnsand Warner Bros. producer Jon Berg as co-chairmen. After several DCEU films received poor reception and underperformed financially, the duo stepped down by the end of 2017, and the division was reorganized, withWalter Hamadahired as the studio's president. Following the merger of DC and Warner Bros. ownerWarnerMediawithDiscovery, Inc.in April 2022, WBD overhauled operations, resulting in Hamada stepping down in October 2022. DC Films was then dissolved in favor of DC Studios, a new division with greater oversight of DC media. Gunn and Safran, who had worked on some DCEU projects, were hired to lead the studio, and the duo began work on the DCU as a new franchise to serve as asoft rebootof the DCEU.
From 2016 to 2023, DC Films produced 13 films within the DCEU, fromSuicide Squad(2016) toAquaman and the Lost Kingdom(2023), alongside two standalone films,Joker(2019) andThe Batman(2022).Jokerand the studio's filmAquaman(2018) are among the50 highest-grossing filmsof all time, withJokerbecoming the firstR-rated filmto gross over $1 billion. The first DC Studios production is the television seriesThe Penguin(2024), a spin-off fromThe Batman. DC Studios plans to release films and television series within the DCU, starting with the animated seriesCreature Commandosin 2024, and the filmSupermanin 2025. Productions that are not part of the DCU are set to be part of the "DC Elseworlds" label. The studio's first animated film will beDynamic Duo(2028).
After the divisive reception toBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016),Warner Bros. Picturessought to stabilize the direction of its media franchise andshared universe, theDC Extended Universe(DCEU). In May 2016, the studio reorganized to have genre-responsible film executives, thusDC Entertainmentfilms under Warner Bros. Pictures were placed under a new division, DC Films, to be led by Warner Bros.executive vice president, Jon Berg, and thechief creative officerofDC Comics,Geoff Johns. This was done in hopes of competing more directly withMarvel Studios' franchise, theMarvel Cinematic Universe. Johns kept his role at DC Comics, and reported to DC Entertainment's president,Diane Nelson, while Berg reported to Warner Bros. Pictures' president, Greg Silverman.[3]The division's formation was not designed to override the "director-driven" mandate.[8]
Justice League(2017) had one of the biggest film budgets (nearly $300 million) but grossed about $96 million in its opening weekend. An analysis inThe Washington Postexpected that there would be a course correction again, with a possible change in leadership.[9]Forbescontributors felt that the course correction would be for DC Films to give up on the shared universe, while continuing with theWonder Womanfilms and occasionally other films, as Warner Bros. had other franchises they could work with.[10]Despite this, in December, the studio reiterated their planned film slate for the DCEU.[11]That same month, Warner Bros. announced that a new strategy and organization of DC Films would occur, with Berg leaving his position as the studio's co-president of production to form a Warner Bros.–based production company withRoy Lee.[12][13]Johns was expected to remain involved in future DC films moving forward in an advisory role while continuing as the president and chief creative officer of DC Entertainment, with Warner Bros. expected to hire a new studio head.[12]In January 2018, Warner Bros. executiveWalter Hamadawas appointed as the new president of DC Films, to oversee the films in the DCEU. Hamada was closely associated withNew Line Cinema, and helped develop horror films, such asIt(2017) andThe Conjuringfilm franchise.[14]Johns subsequently left his role at DC Entertainment that June and he was no longer involved with the DCEU.[7]
In April 2022, after the merger between Warner Bros.' parent companyWarnerMediaandDiscovery, Inc.to formWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the new CEODavid Zaslavwas exploring a restructuring of DC Entertainment, including having a creative leader akin to Marvel Studios presidentKevin Feigeto lead its film and television projects.[15]Later in July,Toby Emmerichstepped down as the head of the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group. The group was restructured to give DC Films, Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, andWarner Animation Grouprespective leadership. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De LucaandPamela Abdybecame the co-executives of Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. They were also temporarily signed to oversee the remaining units of the group until the new positions were filled.[16][17]
When the release of the filmBatgirlwas canceled by WBD in August, Hamada was not consulted regarding the decision and only learned about it when De Luca and Abdy informed him at a test screening forBlack Adam(2022). Hamada was upset and considered resigning, but agreed to stay untilBlack Adam'srelease.[18]Later that month,Dan Linentered talks to oversee DC's film and television divisions. From this position, Lin was expected to report directly to Zaslav, while Hamada would depart the studio.[19][20]In September, Lin and WBD ended negotiations and agreed to part ways.[21]DuringBlack Adam'sTimes Square premiere in October, star and producerDwayne Johnsonsaid he could be a consultant at DC Films, helping the studio find its next creative leader.[22]Later that month, it was reported that De Luca had been effectively running DC Films in place of Hamada.[23]On October 19, Hamada departed the company, two days before the release ofBlack Adam.[24]
Less than a week after Hamada's departure, writer/directorJames Gunnand producerPeter Safran, who had previously worked together on the DCEU projectsThe Suicide Squad(2021) and its spin-off seriesPeacemaker(2022), were announced as the co-CEOs and co-chairmen of DC Studios, a newly-created production entity under WBD. DC Films was dissolved, and DC Studios helped oversee the remaining films from the studio that were pending release in 2023. The duo was tasked with leading the production of films, television, animation, and video games under the DC label, reporting directly to Zaslav, while also working alongside but independently of the heads of WBD's other divisions. Gunn oversees the creative development of DC projects, while Safran supervises the production side. Their roles officially began on November 1, 2022.[1][25][2][26]
In November, Gunn said that the studio would focus on multiple DCU live-action and animated projects, but also stated that they would acknowledge fan responses and complaints,[27]and confirmed all subsequent DC projects would be released under the DC Studios banner, including those that were filmed before the formation of the studio.[28]In December, Gunn announced that he was writing a new Superman film that would feature a younger actor in the role.Henry Cavillwas not set to return asSuperman, whileBen Affleck, who portrayedBruce Wayne / Batmanin the DCEU, was reported to be in talks to direct a new DC Studios project, before Affleck stated that he was not interested in directing a DC film.[29][30]Gunn later revealed that new DC films would have an equal focus on popular and obscure characters, drawing inspiration from the DC animated seriesJustice League Unlimited(2004–2006) andYoung Justice(2010–2022).[31][32]
On January 31, 2023, Gunn and Safran announced the first slate of DCU content, titled "Chapter One: Gods and Monsters". They also assembled awriters' roomthat includedDrew Goddard,Jeremy Slater,Christina Hodson, Christal Henry, andTom King.[31]Projects that are not a part of the shared universe will be branded as "DC Elseworlds".[33]The following month, Gunn confirmed development for animated films within both the DCU and DC Elseworlds.[34]Gunn said in March that they were working on potentially incorporating characters from DC'sVertigo Comicsimprint beyond theSwamp Thingfilm,[35]and said the following month that there were plans to incorporate characters from the DC-ownedMilestone Media, such asStatic.[36]In September, WBD announced that it would expand its production facility atWarner Bros. Studios Leavesden, England, which would serve as the primary production hub for DC Studios. Gunn and Safran were consulting on the expansion, with work starting in the second quarter of 2024 and was expected to be finished in 2027.[37]
In February 2024, Gunn and Safran worked with WBD corporate siblings to acquire theChristopher ReevedocumentarySuper/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story(2024).[38][39]This is the first film to be released under the DC Studios banner,[40]whileThe Penguin(2024) is the first DC Studios production and the first series to be released under that banner.[41]AtSan Diego Comic-Conin July 2024, Gunn unveiled the official logo for DC Studios as an updated version of the 1977 "DC Bullet" logo designed byMilton Glaser, alongside an animated introduction sequence featuring Superman,[42][43][44]in a recreation of the back cover ofSuperman#1(1939) designed byWarner Bros. Animation.[45]The updated logo was also being used for DC Comics and its affiliated units,[42][43][44]but was not used for some earlier projects that DC Studios had inherited, namelyThe Penguinand the animated seriesHarley Quinn(2019–present), because they were not as involved in those. A slightly different DC Studios logo animation is used for the end credits onThe Penguin, while a separate logo and opening animation are set to be used for future projects released under the "DC Elseworlds" banner.[45]
That October, DC Studios andWarner Bros. Pictures Animationgreenlit the theatrical animated filmDynamic Duo(2028), which is DC Studios's first animated film and the first new project to move forward at the studio following its DCU announcements.[46][47][48]The filmJoker: Folie à Deux(2024) is part of the "DC Elseworlds" label and was overseen by Warner Bros. Pictures co-chiefs De Luca and Abdy, without the involvement of Gunn, Safran, or DC Studios, although the DC logo used before that studio's formation is included in the credits. At the time of the film's release later that month, Gunn said that "[a]ll future films with DC characters [would] be DC Studios" productions moving forward,[49]and he later clarified that the studio would release every subsequent film and television adaptation from DC.[45][50]Ahead of the premiere of the DCU seriesCreature Commandosin December 2024, DC Studios announced the unscripted biweekly video podcast seriesDC Studios Showcase: The Official Podcast, produced byOBB Soundfor the streaming serviceMax.[51]Later that month, they also announced the launch of its DC Studios Fan First newsletter via DC's website, to provide updates on the company's projects, with an introduction message written by Gunn.[52]In February 2025, DC Studios announced that it had greenlit three "younger-skewed" animated series—Starfire!,My Adventures with Green Lantern, andDC Super Powers—which were being co-produced with Warner Bros. Animation.[53]
All of the live-action and animated films by DC Films and DC Studios are distributed byWarner Bros. Pictures.
In addition to the following films, DC Studios has also reserved release dates for unspecified films on May 29, 2026, and March 5, 2027.[60]

Soon after their second child was born, they joined the religious cultChildren of Godand travelled throughout theCaribbeanandSouth Americaas missionaries, where the next two children were born. They eventually became disillusioned with the group and left in 1977, being opposed to the cult's increasingly distorted rules, particularly the practice offlirty fishing.[13]The fifth child was born in Florida where the family settled; around this time they legally adopted the surname Phoenix, inspired by themythical birdthat rises from its own ashes, symbolizing a new beginning.[1]When Joaquin was three, he and his older siblings witnessed fish being stunned as "they were throwing them against the side of the boat", prompting the whole family to convert to aveganlifestyle.[14]At this time, Phoenix first referred to himself as "Leaf", having been inspired by spending time outdoors raking leaves and wanting a nature-related name like his siblings'.[2]He reverted to his birth name, Joaquin, at age 15.[1]
In 1979, when Phoenix's father had to stop working because of an old spinal injury, the family moved to Los Angeles where the mother met a high-profile child agent namedIris Burton, who got the children into commercials and bit parts on TV.[15]Phoenix made his acting debut alongside his brother in the television seriesSeven Brides for Seven Brothersin the 1982 episode "Christmas Song".[16]He has said of his first acting experience:
Instantaneous joy. The most enjoyable thing. For some kids, it's the first time they crack a ball or score a goal. For me, it was this. I was eight years old, and I remember the first scene on the TV set so vividly. And I knew that I loved it – the physical sensation; how powerful it was. That's the feeling I've been chasing ever since.[17]
In 1984, Phoenix starred opposite his brother River in theABC Afterschool SpecialentitledBackwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia, for which they shared a nomination for Best Young Actor in a Family Film Made for Television at the6th Youth in Film Awards.[18]He also made guest appearances in theMurder, She Wroteepisode "We're Off to Kill the Wizard", and individual episodes ofThe Fall GuyandHill Street Blues.[19][20]A year later, he appeared in the television filmKids Don't Tell.

The film premiered at the1995 Cannes Film Festivaland became a financial and critical success, withNew York TimescriticJanet Maslinpraising Phoenix's performance, writing "So pity poor Jimmy. Rivetingly played by Mr Phoenix with a raw, anguished expressiveness that makes him an actor to watch for, Jimmy is both tempted and terrified by Suzanne's slick amorality. In that, he speaks for us all."[30][31]
In 1997, Phoenix played a small-town troublemaker inOliver Stone'sU Turn, and a poor man in love with a rich woman inInventing the Abbotts.

Winslet and Phoenix generate real fire, notably when Abbe dreams of ravishing Madeleine on the altar."[43]For his combined roles of that year, Phoenix was awarded theBroadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actorand theNational Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor.[44]
The following year, Phoenix starred in the satirical filmBuffalo Soldiersas aU.S. Armysoldier. The world premiere was held at the 2001Toronto International Film Festivalin early September.

The science fictionthrillerSigns(2002) marked Phoenix's first collaboration with directorM. Night Shyamalan.

He admitted that he was afraid of heights before he started making this film, recalling "I got to the pole and I looked down and I couldn't do it. But you go through the training and it exposes your fears and helps you to overcome them. We ended up rappelling off a six-story tower and that really helped."[59]The film earned$102.3 millionat the box office[60]despite receiving generally mixed reviews.[61]Roger Ebertgave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the performances in the film.[62]Phoenix's final film of 2004 wasTerry George'sHotel Rwanda, playing cameraman Jack Daglish.

The closing credits make it clear it's Joaquin Phoenix doing the singing, and I was gob-smacked".[69]For his portrayal of Johnny Cash, he won theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedyand theGrammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Mediafor the film's soundtrack.[70]Phoenix also received a second Academy Award nomination, his first in theBest Actorcategory as well as a second BAFTA nomination.[71]Earlier that year, he narratedEarthlings(2005), a documentary about the investigation of animal abuse infactory farms, and pet mills, and for scientific research.

Phoenix's first producing task was the action thrillerWe Own the Night(2007), in which he played nightclub manager Bobby Green/Grusinsky who tries to save his brother (Mark Wahlberg) and father (Robert Duvall) fromRussian mafiahitmen. The James Gray-directed film premiered at the2007 Cannes Film Festivalto mixed reviews;[74]Roger Ebert praised Gray's direction and the acting, but criticized its screenplay for lack of originality.[75]David EdelsteinofNew Yorkmagazine commended Phoenix for elevating the film's conflict, writing that it "might be heavy-handed without Phoenix's face—his irresolution somehow more powerful than other actors' resolve. There is no artifice. He's not an actor disappearing into a role but a man disappearing into himself [...] Phoenix homes in on the truth of this person. It's the paradox of the greatest acting".[76]
Later that year, he played a father obsessed with finding out who killed his son in ahit-and-run accidentin his second feature with Terry George, the crime drama filmReservation Road. The film received mixed reviews from critics;[77]Peter Travers praised Phoenix's acting stating "Even the best actors—and I'd rank Joaquin Phoenix andMark Ruffaloamong their generation's finest—can't save a movie that aims for tragedy but stalls at soap opera."[78]Phoenix also executive produced the television show4Real, a half-hour program which began airing in 2007. The series showcased celebrity guests on global adventures "in order to connect with young leaders who are creating social and economic change".[79]

By claiming to retire from acting, he and Affleck planned to make a film that "explored celebrity, and explored the relationship between the media and the consumers and the celebrities themselves" through their film.[86][87]
In 2011, it was announced that Phoenix would star inPaul Thomas Anderson's drama filmThe Master, which traces the relationship between Freddie Quell (Phoenix), aWorld War IInavy veteran struggling to adjust to a post-war society and Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a leader of a religious movement known as "The Cause".

You can't take your eyes off him." His performance as Freddie was described as "career-defining" byTodd McCarthyofThe Hollywood Reporter, who was impressed that Anderson and Phoenix collaboratively were able to build such complex work around such a derelict figure.[92][93]Fellow actorDaniel Day-Lewispublicly lauded the "remarkable" Phoenix while accepting the Screen Actors Guild Award, apologizing for the fact that Phoenix hadn't been nominated for the same award.[94]Despite this, Phoenix received his third Academy, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for his leading role.[95]

Clubthought the film featured one of his best performances and commended Phoenix's and Gray's developing work, writing of that "the two are so perfectly in sync, that it's hard to tell where Phoenix's performance ends and Gray's visual style[...]—begins", further lauding their development of Bruno into "a fully fledged tragic character, even though he is neither the protagonist ofThe Immigrantnor the main driving force behind its plot".[97]
His next feature film of that year was theSpike Jonze-directed romantic science-fiction dramaHer. He played Theodore Twombly, a man who develops a relationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), an intelligent computer operating system personified through a female voice. Released to critical acclaim, critic A.A. Dowd ofThe A.V. Clublabeled Phoenix as "one of the most emotionally honest actors in Hollywood", impressed at how he effortlessly unleashes waves of vulnerability in the film's many tight, invasive close-up images, calling it a "tremendous performance, one that rescues this character—a mess of insecurities, regrets, and desires—from the walking pity party he could have been".[98]Herearned more than double of its production budget,[99]and Phoenix received his fourth nomination at the Golden Globes.[100]Several journalists expressed disappointment over his failure to receive an Oscar nomination for it,[101]withPeter KnegtofIndieWirenaming it of one of ten worst Oscar actingsnubsof the last decade in 2015.[102]
In 2014, Phoenix took on the role of Doc Sportello, aprivate investigatorandhippie/dope headtrying to help his ex-girlfriend solve a crime in the crime comedy-dramaInherent Vice, based onThomas Pynchon's detectivenovel of the same name. Reviews toward the film were positive; critics praised Phoenix's performance and Paul Thomas Anderson's direction, while some were frustrated by its complicated plot.[103]Robbie CollinofThe Daily Telegraphtermed Phoenix as Anderson's "perfect leading man" and his work as "the kind of quietly dazzling performance that rarely wins awards but will be adoringly dissected and quoted for decades".[104]Phoenix earned his fifth Golden Globe nomination for the film.[105]
After narrating the sequel toEarthlings, the 2015animal rights' documentaryUnity,[106]Phoenix teamed with directorWoody AllenandEmma Stonein the crime mystery filmIrrational Man.

The film was released to mixed reviews at the2015 Cannes Film Festival;The Hollywood Reporterfelt that the film was too similar to Allen's previous films, but praised Phoenix's chemistry with Stone and Phoenix for playing the character "with a wonderful baggy, lived-in quality that makes us want to climb inside the character's whiskey-sozzled head".[107]
The thrillerYou Were Never Really Here, written and directed byLynne Ramsayand based on the novella of the same name byJonathan Ames, ranks among the most acclaimed films of Phoenix's career.[108]The film is about Joe (played by Phoenix), a traumatized formerFBI agentandGulf Warveteran who tracks down missing girls for a living.

In 2018, Phoenix portrayed Jesus in the biblical dramaMary Magdalene, written byHelen Edmundsonand directed byGarth Davis. The film, and his performance, received mixed reviews; a reviewer forEntertainment Weeklythought that Phoenix lacked the quiet compassion and grace that was required for the role, while Nick Allen of Roger Ebert's website described his performance as "a human being who is visibly tormented by the power and wisdom that works through him", deeming it one of the best portrayals of Jesus ever.[114][115]His next two features — the biopicDon't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Footand the crime dramaThe Sisters Brothers— were much better received. In the former, Phoenix reunited with hisTo Die Fordirector Gus Van Sant to portrayquadriplegiccartoonistJohn Callahan. Barry Hertz ofThe Globe and Mailwrote that there's no better leading actor producing better work than Phoenix, stating "The actor—never a simple chameleon, but someone who disappears into a role entirely with a frightening conviction—continues to display new and tremendous range here" and David Hughes ofEmpirethought that in a more conventional film, Phoenix would be the favorite to win an Academy Award.[116][117]
The third film of 2018 wasThe Sisters Brothers,Jacques Audiard's adaptation of thenovel of the same namebyPatrick deWitt. The film starredJohn C. Reillyand Phoenix as the notorious assassin brothers Eli and Charlie Sisters respectively and chronicles their chase after two men who have banded together to search for gold.

While Phoenix's performance received rave reviews, the dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided opinions and generated concerns of inspiring real-life violence; the movie theater where the2012 Aurora, Colorado, mass shootingoccurred during a screening ofThe Dark Knight Risesrefused to show it.[126]Despite this,Jokerbecame a box office success grossing over$1 billion(against its$55 millionproduction budget), the firstR-rated filmto do so, becoming Phoenix's highest-grossing film.[127]Pete Hammond ofDeadlinewrote of Phoenix's "extraordinary" performance, describing it as "dazzling risky and original"[128]andThe Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called his performance the "must-see factor" of the film, writing "he inhabits [the character] with an insanity by turns pitiful and fearsome in an out-there performance that's no laughing matter[...]Phoenix is the prime force that makes Joker such a distinctively edgy entry in the Hollywood comics industrial complex."[129]The film earned him numerous awards, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, aSAGand aCritic's Choice Awardfor Best Actor.[130]
In 2020, Phoenix served as an executive producer onGunda, directed byViktor Kossakovsky. The acclaimed documentary follows the daily life of a pig, two cows, and a one-legged chicken.[131]That same year, Phoenix was named on the list of the 25 Greatest Actors of the 21st Century byThe New York Times. The list was compiled by famed criticsManohla DargisandA.O. Scottand Phoenix's paragraph was written by his frequent collaborator, director James Gray.[132]
In 2021, he starred inMike Mills' dramaC'mon C'mon, as Johnny, a radio journalist who embarks on a cross-country trip with his young nephew. TheA24film premiered at the48th Telluride Film Festivalwhere it scored the best per-venue average for a limited release since the start of theCOVID-19 pandemicupon its release.[133][134]Angelica Jade Bastién ofVulturepraised Phoenix, writing "a tremendous showing from Joaquin Phoenix, operating at a register he's rarely found before. It's a career best for him—lovely, empathetic, humane[...]He possesses a warmth that glows from beginning to end. As Johnny, Phoenix listens to people and the world around him with full-bodied curiosity. This is where the bravura lies in the performance: his ability to seemingly just be."[135]
Phoenix starred as Beau Wassermann, thetitle characterinAri Aster'ssurrealistblacktragicomedyBeau Is Afraid(2023), which was released on April 14, 2023, before a wide release the following week. In it, he portrays a mild-mannered butparanoia-ridden man who embarks on a surreal odyssey to get home to his mother, confronting his greatest fears along the way.[136]The actor shared the cast withAmy Ryan,Nathan LaneandPatti LuPone. The film received generally favourable reviews, with critics crediting Aster's direction and Phoenix and his "sheer commitment" to the role, for giving the film its "undeniable power".[137]Tomris Laffly ofTheWrapcalled his performance as Beau "one of his best performances", praising his ability to act with "a startling level of vulnerability[...]both enigmatic and translucently bare".[138]Phoenix received his seventh Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the film.[139]
Phoenix portrayedNapoleon BonaparteinNapoleon, his second collaboration with director Ridley Scott, released in November 2023, withVanessa KirbyasJoséphine de Beauharnais. The film grossed over$200 millionand received mixed reviews (though mostly negative reviews in France), mostly criticized for its pacing and historical inaccuracies. For example, the French GQ magazine called the film "deeply clumsy, unnatural, and unintentionally awkward."[140]In 2024, Phoenix reprised his role as Joker in Phillips' sequelJoker: Folie à DeuxwithLady GagaasHarley Quinn.[141]Unlike the first film, it emerged as a critical and commercial failure.[142]
Phoenix will next reunite with Lynne Ramsay inPolaris, co-starring Rooney Mara, and with Ari Aster in the contemporary Western filmEddington.[143][144]He was originally set to star alongsideDanny Ramirezin a film byTodd Haynes, a sexually explicit "love story between two men" set in 1930s Los Angeles.[145]Phoenix had co-written it with Haynes, advising him to "go further" with the explicit material, which Haynes said would have likely made it anNC-17rated film.[146]The project was cancelled when Phoenix abruptly exited five days before filming began.[147][148]
"When I was 15 or 16 my brother River [Phoenix] came home from work and he had a VHS copy of a movie calledRaging Bulland he sat me down and made me watch it. And the next day he woke me up, and he made me watch it again. And he said, "You're going to start acting again, this is what you're going to do." He didn't ask me, he just told me. And I am indebted to him for that because acting has given me such an incredible life".
At the beginning of his career, Phoenix was often referred to as "the second most famous Phoenix", his name associated most closely with the death of his brotherRiver Phoenix.[8]The media would often compare the two, withThe New York Timesdescribing Joaquin as "sweetly unsettling and endlessly vulnerable" compared to his brother's "pure all-American blond boyishness".[150]After his brother died, Phoenix gained a reputation for his distrust of the media, with many speculating that it is derived from how River's death was covered by the press. He was often asked about the day River died, and still is to this date. Phoenix has described these interviews as "insincere" and has felt that they impeded on the mourning process.[8][151]
Caroline Frost ofThe Huffington Posthas said that Phoenix is "engaging, engaged, mischievous, honest" in person andAnderson Cooperof60 Minutesthought that he was "wry, shy and couldn't be any more friendlier" adding that Phoenix "just doesn't like to talk about himself".[152]Although known for his intensity and darkness on-screen, directorJames Graywho worked with Phoenix in four feature films, says that Phoenix is very different off-screen saying "He's actually very tender and sweet and sensitive. It's almost as if he channels his intensity into the characters. Like the work is an outlet for his darker side."[110][153]
Phoenix has been described as one of the finest actors of his generation.[150][154][155][156]As he achieved stardom afterGladiator(2000), he was conveniently ruled out ofteen-idolroles because of his hard gaze and scarred lip.[154]Justin Chang, analyzing his career inLos Angeles Timesin 2020, remarked that filmmakers immediately seemed to recognize that Phoenix was more than a heartthrob, and that there was "something more tortured, more vulnerable and infinitely more interesting at play beneath the surface". He noted that through his work, Phoenix is challenging and redefining cinematic manhood and that this quality sets him apart from most of his contemporaries.[155]Film criticandfilm historianLeonard Maltinhas called Phoenix "a true chameleon", writing 
"[Phoenix] commands the screen and breaks your heart; he makes us feel it all vicariously."[157]
Phoenix is particularly known for his ability to heavily commit to each role he plays and his intense preparations, deeply immersing himself in the characters, often blurring the lines between fiction and reality.[158][8]That immersion was particularly evident during the filming of themockumentaryI'm Still Here(2010), when Phoenix announced to the world that he was retiring from acting to become a rapper. Throughout the filming period, Phoenix remained in character for public appearances, giving many the impression that he was genuinely pursuing a new career. Media outlets worldwide believed that Phoenix was having amental breakdownafter his infamous appearance onThe Late Show with David Letterman.[159]Confusion from the media turned to concern as the seemingly drug-addled Phoenix continued his attempts to convince crowds he was serious about a rap career. Many worried his erratic behavior was a sign he was stuck in a downward spiral, and headed down the same self-destructive path that took the life of his older brother. Although widely suspected to be a mockumentary, the fact that the events of the film had been deliberately staged was not disclosed until after the film had been released.[85]To this day, some people believe he went through a personal meltdown during the filming period.[8][160]Phoenix has credited the making ofI'm Still Herefor allowing him to make bolder choices in acting.[150]
Phoenix contends there's no real methodology to the roles he chooses, but has said that he is drawn to complex characters.[161]He speculates that his affinity for dark roles derives from something more ineffable, possiblyprenatalsaying that "I think there is a combination of nature and nurture[...]—and some of it is my upbringing." Even so, Phoenix remains reluctant to draw a line between his unusual childhood, his private tragedy and his talent for "inhabiting the morose, damaged, violent, and otherwise anxiety-riddled characters".[8]James Gray has described Phoenix as "one of the most incorruptible people I've ever known, and the least superficial", and has spoken of his acting, saying that he admires Phoenix's "limitless ability to surprise you in the best ways and inspire you to move in a direction that you haven't thought of originally, better than what you have in mind".[132][110]
Garth Davis, who directed Phoenix inMary Magdalene(2018), has remarked that he does not applymethod acting, but said that working with Phoenix is like "working with this beautiful wild animal, where you have to give him the space to be free, so his performance can roam freely: raw, uncontrived and truly natural. If he smells the design of the scene, you lose his free spirit; if the script is weak, he will expose its flaws. He is fiercely intelligent and almost completely instinctual. And he has this immense sensitivity that can be both his curse and his gift, but for me, that is what it means to be human".[110]In an interview withThe Guardianin 2015, Phoenix said that he prefersindependent filmovermajor studio film, citing that "the quality of acting suffers".[162]
In 2019, Phoenix stated that in choosing films, he solely relies on the director, "I don't really care about genre or budget size, anything like that. It's just whether there is a filmmaker that has a unique vision, has a voice, and the ability to make the film."[163]For Phoenix, a great performance is in the director's hands — it's ultimately the director's world he's entering. He maintains that the director creates the character's arc and that the best directors adjust to what is happening with the actor in the moment.[150]
Phoenix has citedRobert De Niroas one of his favorite actors and strongest acting influences. Phoenix recalled watchingRaging Bullfor the first time in an interview, "I think it just… awakened something in me. And I could suddenly see it through his eyes. There's a part inRaging Bullwhere De Niro meets a girl in between a chain-link fence. And he, you know, shakes her pinky and it's like this just beautiful little detail, it's this wonderful moment. And I think that in some ways is what I'm always looking for."[164]
Phoenix has directed music videos forRingside,[165]She Wants Revenge,[166]People in Planes,[167]Arckid,[168]Albert Hammond Jr.,[169]andSilversun Pickups.[170]He was said to have produced the opening track forPusha T'sMy Name Is My Namealbum alongsideKanye West. The track is called "King Push". Phoenix then denied in a statement toXXLhaving produced the record, saying, "While it was widely reported that Pusha T used my beat and that I produced his song, I can't take any credit. A friend's son played me his music, and all I did was make an introduction to Kanye [West]'s camp."[171]
Phoenix is identified as one of the most active celebrities in theanimal rights movement.[172]A vegan since age three, he does not wear any clothes made out of animal skin; he requests that all of his leather costumes in films are made from synthetic materials.[173]Phoenix has said that animal rights are one of the most important pillars in his life, and maintains that "climate change is imminent if we do not adopt a plant-based lifestyle".[174]He has helped raise awareness of the correlation between animal rights, climate change and health issues.[175]
Phoenix has received praise and accolades from animal rights groups, withPETAnaming him "Person of the Year" in 2019. PETA's president,Ingrid Newkirksaid in a statement: "Joaquin Phoenix never misses an opportunity to turn the spotlight away from himself and onto animals' plight and to set a great example of walking the vegan walk".[176]He has been an active supporter of numerous animal rights organizations, including PETA.[177]
"We go into the natural world, and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. Then we take her milk that's intended for her calf, and we put it in our coffee and our cereal. And I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something, to give something up, but human beings, at our best, are so inventive and creative and ingenious. And I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles, we can create, develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment."
Throughout the years, Phoenix has headlined numerous campaigns for different organizations to help promote veganism and end animal slaughter.[179]In 2019, Phoenix and his partnerRooney Maraled the National Animal Rights Day demonstration to help spread awareness for animal rights.[180]On January 10, 2020, Phoenix was arrested with actressJane Fondaat a climate change protest outside theUnited States Capitolin Washington, D.C. At the protest, Phoenix spoke about the link betweenanimal agriculture and climate change.[181]
Phoenix has also been vocal in drawing attention to the suffering of fish, which he sees as a neglected cause in the sphere of animal rights. Fish, says Phoenix, are the "last thing besides insects that people don’t really consider".[182]Phoenix's views were shaped by a childhood incident in which he saw fish brutally flung against the side of the boat.[183][184]In 2013, he simulated drowning in a 41-secondPETAspot, designed to dramatise how fish suffer in the final moments of their lives. The video was shot by photographer Michael Muller.[185]
During the 2019–20awards season, amid protesting for animal rights, Phoenix had been driving a behind-the-scenes movement that transformed five events to meat-free menus, beginning with theGolden Globe Awards. He acknowledged theHollywood Foreign Press Associationduring his acceptance speech, for its "very bold move making tonight plant-based. It really sends a powerful message." Soon after,Critics' ChoiceandSAGfollowed suit. Phoenix contacted the presidents of the award ceremonies, accompanied by signatures from the likes of fellow nomineesLeonardo DiCaprioandPhoebe Waller-Bridge. Phoenix's pitch was that meat agriculture is a leading cause of climate change and that the televised spectacles should use their platforms to address pressing societal issues. TheAcademy Awardslater announced that all food served at theDolby Theatrebefore the Oscars was going to be vegan. Lisa Lange, Senior Vice President of Communications at PETA, spoke of Phoenix's power saying "He knows what can be done. He knows he's in a good position to push. He enlists friends. And it works. He can have influence in Hollywood and it influences the rest of the world."[186]
A day after winning theAcademy Award for Best Actor, and subsequently delivering a headlining acceptance speech in which he spoke to the plight of mother cows and their babies used in animal agriculture, Phoenix helped to rescue a cow and her newborn calf from a Los Angeles slaughterhouse. They were taken toFarm Sanctuary, an animal sanctuary and advocacy organization, where they will live out the rest of their lives.[187]The same month, he starred inGuardians of Life, the first of twelve short films by the environmental organizationMobilize Earththat highlighted the most pressing issues facing humanity and the natural world. Funds raised by the project went toAmazon WatchandExtinction Rebellion.[188]Dávid Szőke and Sándor Kiss inFilm Internationalwere highly critical of this move, arguing that "what is rather mind-boggling is that the discourse centers less on the issue of the calf and its mother or the exploitation of our natural world, and more on Phoenix in the leading role as the savior of our planet, raising questions about the narrative’s alignment with his environmental activism."[189]
Two animal species have been named after him. In 2011, atrilobitespecies was namedGladiatoria phoenixfor his iconic role in the 2000 filmGladiator, and in 2020, a spider species endemic to Iran was namedLoureedia phoenixi(also known as the Joker spider) due to its color pattern matching the DC Comics characterJoker, for his role in the 2019 filmJoker.[190][191][192]
In 2020, Phoenix collaborated withJusticeLAto create a public service announcement #SuingToSaveLives about the health of people in L.A. County jails amid theCOVID-19 pandemic.[193][194]
In October 2023, Phoenix signed an open letter by artists to PresidentJoe Bidencalling for a ceasefire during theIsraeli bombardment of Gaza.[195]The letter reads: "We believe all life is sacred, no matter faith or ethnicity and we condemn the killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians."[196]
After reestablishing himself as an actor in the mid-1990s, Phoenix moved back toLos Angeles.[150]He is known for his disdain ofcelebrity culture, rarely granting interviews, and being reticent about discussing his private life.[110][151]In 2018, he described himself as asecular Jewwho did not affiliate with any organized religion; one of his "core values" is the idea of forgiveness.[197]He has also claimed that his mother believes in Jesus, though his parents were not religious. While portraying Jesus in the 2018 movieMary Magdalene, he expressed that the role changed his perspective on the nature of forgiveness.[198]
In early April 2005, Phoenix checked himself into rehab to be treated for alcoholism.[199]Twelve years later, he revealed that he did not need anintervention: "I really just thought of myself as ahedonist. I was an actor in L.A. I wanted to have a good time. But I wasn't engaging with the world or myself in the way I wanted to". On January 26, 2006, while driving down a winding canyon road in Hollywood, Phoenix veered off the road and flipped his car.[200]The crash was reportedly caused by brake failure. Shaken and confused, he heard someone tapping on his window and telling him to "just relax". Unable to see the man, Phoenix replied, "I'm fine. I am relaxed." The man replied, "No, you're not." The man then stopped Phoenix from lighting a cigarette while gasoline was leaking into the car cabin. Phoenix realized that the man was German filmmakerWerner Herzog. While Herzog helped Phoenix out of the wreckage by breaking the back window of the car, bystanders called an ambulance. Phoenix later approached Herzog to express his gratitude.[201][202]
In 2012, Phoenix labeled theAcademy Awards"bullshit". He later gave an interview apologizing for his comments, and acknowledged that the awards provided an important platform for many deserving filmmakers.[203]He elaborated on the topic while onJimmy Kimmel Live!in 2015, explaining that he was uncomfortable receiving accolades for his work, considering the filmmaking process a collaborative one.[204]
A longtime vegan, Phoenix findsanimal agriculture"absurd and barbaric". He explained his reasoning behind hisveganism: "To me, it just seems obvious—I don't want to cause pain to another living empathetic creature. I don't want to take its babies away from it, I don't want to force it to be indoors and fattened up just to be slaughtered. Certainly, also, the effect that it has on our environment is devastating. So, for me, it's my life and has always been my life, and it's really one of the most important things to me."[205]
Phoenix is on the board of directors forThe Lunchbox Fund, a non-profit organization which provides daily meals to students of township schools inSoweto, South Africa, founded by Page-Green.[206]
From 1995 to 1998, Phoenix dated hisInventing the Abbottsco-starLiv Tyler. The two remain close friends, with Tyler considering Phoenix and his sisters as her family.[207]He was romantically involved with South African modelTopaz Page-Greenfrom 2001 to 2005.[208]From 2013 to 2015 he was in a relationship with artistAllie Teilz.[209]
In 2012, Phoenix metHerco-starRooney Mara. The two remained friends and began a romantic relationship four years later, during the making ofMary Magdalene.[8][210]They were engaged to be married in 2019, but the ceremony never took place.[211]In August 2020, the couple had a son.[212]In June 2024, they welcomed their second child.[213]They reside in theHollywood Hills. Phoenix has described his family life as simple. He enjoys meditating, watching documentaries, reading scripts, and taking karate classes. He has ablack beltin karate.[150][214]In September 2024, Joaquin Phoenix formalized his marriage with Rooney during Talk Easy podcast.[215]

He frequently appeared in the live alternative stand-up series he had organized withJaneane GarofalocalledEating It, which used the rock barLuna Loungein New York'sLower East Sideas its venue, from the 1990s until the building was razed in 2005.[27]
His first one-man show,Jerusalem Syndrome, had an extendedoff-Broadwayrun in 2000 and was released in book form in 2001. In 2009, he began workshopping another one-man show,Scorching the Earth. According to Maron (inScorching The Earth), these two shows "bookend" his relationship with his second wife, comicMishna Wolff, which ended in a bitter divorce.[28][29]
In May 2008, he toured withEugene MirmanandAndy KindlerinStand Uppity: Comedy That Makes You Feel Better About Yourself and Superior to Others.In January 2009, a collaboration withSam Seder, which had begun in September 2007 as a weekly hour-long video webcast becameBreakroom Live with Maron & Seder, produced by Air America.[30]Until its cancellation in July 2009, the show was webcast live weekdays at 3 p.m. Eastern, with episodes archived for later viewing. In its final incarnation, the show was informal, taking place in the actual break room of Air America Media, with the cafeteria vending machines just off-camera. This meant occasional distractions when Air America staff and management alike would occasionally come in for food and drink. Maron and Seder held court in an online "post-show chat" with viewers, in an even less formal continuation of each webcast, after the credits had rolled.
Maron's stand-up act is marked by his commitment to self-revelation and cultural analysis. He is particularly known for relentless on-stage exploration of his own relationships with family, girlfriends, and other stand-up comedians whom he has known and befriended over his years in the business.[31]In October 2013, Maron released his first hour-long special through Netflix,Marc Maron: Thinky Pain.[32]Maron would follow this with another special,More Later, which was released in December 2015 throughEpix.[33]

His 2023 specialFrom Bleak to Darkwas namedNew Yorkmagazine's "No. 1 Best Comedy Special of 2023."[35]
From almost the first day of theliberal talk radionetworkAir America's broadcasts in 2004, Maron co-hostedMorning Sedition, a three-hour early-morningradio showwithMark Rileythat aired weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern time.[36]The show was unique in the Air America lineup in its heavy reliance on both live and pre-produced sketch comedy, utilizing the talents of staff writers as well as the on-air hosts. The format was aleft-leaningnear-satire of typical morning "Buddy" radio programs, including recurring characters, interviews and listener call-in segments, and it attracted a loyal fan base.[37]
As 2005 came to an end, it became known that Maron's contract would not be renewed on its December 1, 2005, end date because of problems with then Air America executive Danny Goldberg. Goldberg reportedly did not "get" the comedy or agree with the satiric and often angry tone set by Maron and other writers (Jim EarlandKent Jones) for a morning drive-time show. On November 28, 2005, it was officially announced that Maron's contract had not been renewed. His lastMorning Seditionbroadcast was on December 16, 2005, and the show was discontinued shortly thereafter.[36]
On February 28, 2006, Maron began hosting a nighttime radio program withJim Earlas a sidekick forKTLK Progressive Talk 1150AMin Los Angeles calledThe Marc Maron Showfrom 10:00 pm until midnight PST. The program was frequently delayed (sometimes for over an hour) owing to KTLK's contractual agreement to broadcast local sports events that would often go into overtime.The Marc Maron Showwas never nationally syndicated by Air America despite reported contractual clauses promising such. The show was streamed online live, but the show was not publicized, and the existence of the stream was not well promoted.[citation needed]
On July 5, it was announced that Maron's final episode would be on July 14. A few days before that date, Maron bluntly discussed his long struggle with Air America Radio's executives on-air. In 2008, Marc andSam Sederexpanded their prior collaboration on a weekly hour-long video webcast (streamed at The Sam Seder Show website) into a daily show (and "post-show chat") produced by Air America Media[38]calledMaron v. Seder.[39]The show becameBreakroom Live with Maron & Sederstarting in 2009 and could be viewed on Air America Media's website.[40]On July 15, 2009, after less than one year, Air America Media canceledBreakroom Live. According to the show's hosts, the cancellation was for financial reasons.[41]Ironically, the day before the cancellation, the show got some of the first real publicity it had ever received when MaximumFun.org posted its podcast of an interview with Maron onThe Sound of Young America.[42]
On the finalBreakroom Livewebcast, Maron said that this marked the third time since 2005 he'd been told by an executive at the network that his services would not be required in the immediate future. Co-host Sam Seder pointed out that this would be the end of hisfourthshow at Air America since the troubled network's inception.[43]
Due to a precarious state in his comedic career, on September 1, 2009, Maron began a twice-weeklypodcastcalledWTF with Marc Maronin what Maron would later describe in a 2015 interview as a "Hail Mary pass"; his first-ever guest was fellow stand-upJeff Ross.[44][45]In a free-form discussion, Maron and his guests touch on topics like the arc of the interviewees' careers, their shared past experiences, and stories from the road.[38]As of 2024, Maron has released more than 1,500 episodes of the show, garnering critical acclaim and more than 600 million downloads;[46][47][48]notable guests includePresident Barack Obama,Sir Paul McCartney,Robin Williams,Jerry Seinfeld,Chris Rock,Lorne Michaels,Leonardo DiCaprio, andBrad Pitt. The show has been noted for its influence on other long-form interview podcasts that emerged after its debut.[49][50][51]In April 2021, it was announced that Maron and his producer Brendan McDonald would be the recipients of the first-ever Governors Award by the Podcast Academy for Excellence in Audio (The Ambies) for their work onWTF.[52]The success of Maron's podcast opened up numerous other avenues on film and TV as well as giving him a massive boost to audience attendance at his stand-up shows.
His only major film credit for many years was a small part credited as "angry promoter" in the 2000Cameron CrowefilmAlmost Famous, in which he is first seen fighting withNoah Taylor's character and then yelling at and chasing after the main characters as they drive away on a bus, at which point he yells, "Lock the gates!" which is now used in the intro to his podcasts.[53]He was also featured at the Luna Lounge in the 1997 mockumentaryWho's the Caboose?starringSarah SilvermanandSam Seder.[54]In 2019, Maron starred in aLynn Shelton–directed comedy film titledSword of Trust.[55]In 2020, Maron played publicist Ron Oberman oppositeJohnny Flynn'syoung David Bowie in the movieStardust.[56]

Maron, a television series created by and starring Maron for a 10-episode first season, premiered onIFCon May 3, 2013.[59]The show is loosely autobiographical, revolving around Maron's life as a twice-divorced sober comedian running a comedy podcast out of his garage but establishing many differences between the real-life Maron and the version of him on TV. As the executive producer and star ofMaron, Maron appeared in all 51 episodes of the show from 2013 to 2016, portraying a fictionalized version of himself.[60]The show ended in 2016 after four seasons onIFC.[61]Maron directed two episodes of the show, "The Joke" and "Ex-Pod."

In an interview withKCRW, Maron stated, "I have no idea why they asked me to play guitar on the track. I'm only good at one thing on the guitar. It just so happens it was exactly the thing they needed."[71]
Reviews for the solo were positive.IFC's Melissa Locker said "Marc Maron plays a mean guitar."[72]Spin's Chris Martins called the guitar solo a "shredfest" as well as "angular."[73]The Strangercalled it "a frequency-fraying guitar solo that's better than you'd expect, although it won't makeJ Mascisjealous."[74]
Maron wrote and performed on the score for his filmSword of Trust.[75]
Maron lived inAstoria, Queens, through the 1990s and most of the 2000s, but moved back to Los Angeles in late 2009.[76]Maron also speaks openly of his caring for numerous stray cats that he takes into his home. This has led him to refer to his home, on theWTFpodcast, as the "Cat Ranch".[77]After his cat Boomer went missing, Maron began incorporating the catchphrase "Boomer lives!" to the end of each podcast. Since then, he has one addition to the "Cat Ranch" by the name of Buster Kitten. LaFonda died in December 2019. After she passed, Maron briefly replaced "Boomer lives!" with "LaFonda lives!" for a few episodes of his podcast. Monkey died in August 2020.

Maron has been married twice, to Kimberly Reiss andMishna Wolff, a former stand-up comedian. Both relationships have figured prominently in his act. During numerous appearances at theEdinburgh Fringefestival in 2007, Maron riffed on his then-recent separation and divorce from Wolff.
On the October 14, 2013, episode of his podcast, Maron announced that he had broken up with his former fiancée, Jessica Sanchez.[81]He then had a five-month relationship withMoon Zappa.[82]
