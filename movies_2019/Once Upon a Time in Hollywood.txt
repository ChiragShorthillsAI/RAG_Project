Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.,doing business asColumbia Pictures, is an Americanfilmproductionanddistributioncompany that is the flagship unit of theSony Pictures Motion Picture Group,[2]a division ofSony Entertainment'sSony Pictures, which is one of the"Big Five" film studiosand a subsidiary of the multinational conglomerateSony Group Corporation.[3]
On June 19, 1918, brothersJackandHarry Cohnand their business partnerJoe Brandtfounded the studio asCohn-Brandt-Cohn (CBC) Film Sales Corporation.[4]It adopted the Columbia Pictures name on January 10, 1924 (operating as Columbia Pictures Corporation until December 23, 1968), went public two years later, and eventually began to use the image ofColumbia, the female personification of the United States, as its logo.
In its early years, Columbia was a minor player in Hollywood, but began to grow in the late 1920s, spurred by a successful association with directorFrank Capra. With Capra and others such as the most successful two reel comedy series,The Three Stooges, Columbia became one of the primary homes of thescrewball comedy. In the 1930s, Columbia's major contract stars wereJean ArthurandCary Grant. In the 1940s,Rita Hayworthbecame the studio's premier star and propelled their fortunes into the late 1950s.Rosalind Russell,Glenn FordandWilliam Holdenalso became major stars at the studio.
It is one of the leading film studios in the world, and was one of the so-called "Little Three" among the eight major film studios ofHollywood'sGolden Age.[5]Today, it has become the world's third largest major film studio.
The company was also primarily responsible for distributingDisney'sSilly Symphonyfilm series as well as theMickey Mousecartoon series from 1929 to 1932. The studio is presently headquartered at theIrving ThalbergBuilding on the formerMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(currently known as theSony Pictures Studios) lot inCulver City, California, since 1990.
Columbia Pictures is a member of theMotion Picture Association(MPA), under Sony Pictures Entertainment,[6]and is currently one of the five live-action labels of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, alongsideTriStar Pictures,Screen Gems,Sony Pictures Classics, and3000 Pictures. Columbia's most commercially successful franchises includeSpider-Man,Jumanji,Bad Boys,Men in Black,The Karate Kid,Robert Langdon, andGhostbusters, and the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwideisSpider-Man: No Way Home, which grossed $1.92 billion worldwide.
The studio was founded on June 19, 1918, as Cohn-Brandt-Cohn (CBC) Film Sales by brothersJackandHarry Cohnand Jack's best friendJoe Brandt, and released its first feature filmMore to Be Pitied Than Scornedon August 20, 1922. The film, with a budget of $20,000, was a success, bringing in $130,000 in revenue for the company.[7]Brandt was president of CBC Film Sales, handling sales, marketing and distribution from New York along with Jack Cohn, while Harry Cohn ran production in Hollywood. The studio's early productions were low-budget short subjects:Screen Snapshots, theHallroom Boys(the vaudeville duo ofEdward FlanaganandNeely Edwards), and theCharlie Chaplin-imitatorBilly West.[8]The start-up CBC leased space in aPoverty Rowstudio on Hollywood's famously low-rentGower Street. Among Hollywood's elite, the studio's small-time reputation led some to joke that "CBC" stood for "Corned Beef and Cabbage".[4]
CBC was reorganized asColumbia Pictures Corporationby brothersHarryandJack Cohnand best friendJoe Brandton January 10, 1924.[9]Harry Cohn became president in 1932 and remained head of production as well, thus concentrating enormous power in his hands. He would run Columbia for a total of 34 years, one of the longest tenures of any studio chief (Warner Bros.'Jack L. Warnerwas head of productionorCEO longer but did not become CEO until 1956). Even in an industry rife with nepotism, Columbia was particularly notorious for having a number of Harry and Jack's relatives in high positions. HumoristRobert Benchleycalled it the Pine Tree Studio, "because it has so many Cohns".[10]
Brandt eventually tired of dealing with the Cohn brothers, and in 1932 sold his one-third stake to Jack and Harry Cohn, who took over from him as president.
Columbia's product line consisted mostly of moderately budgeted features and short subjects including comedies, sports films, various serials, and cartoons. Columbia gradually moved into the production of higher-budget fare, eventually joining the second tier of Hollywood studios along withUnited ArtistsandUniversal. Like United Artists and Universal, Columbia was a horizontally integrated company. It controlled production and distribution; it did not own any theaters.
Helping Columbia's climb was the arrival of an ambitious director,Frank Capra. Between 1927 and 1939, Capra constantly pushed Cohn for better material and bigger budgets. A string of hits he directed in the early and mid 1930s solidified Columbia's status as a major studio. In particular,It Happened One Night, which nearly swept the 1934 Oscars, put Columbia on the map. Until then, Columbia's business had depended on theater owners willing to take its films, since it did not have a theater network of its own. Other Capra-directed hits followed, including the original version ofLost Horizon(1937), withRonald Colman, andMr. Smith Goes to Washington(1939), which madeJames Stewarta major star.[citation needed]
In 1933, Columbia hiredRobert Kallochto be its chief fashion and women's costume designer. He was the first contract costume designer hired by the studio,[11]and he established the studio's wardrobe department.[12]Kalloch's employment, in turn, convinced leading actresses that Columbia Pictures intended to invest in their careers.[13]
In 1938, the addition ofB. B. Kahaneas vice president would produceCharles Vidor'sThose High Grey Walls(1939), andThe Lady in Question(1940), the first joint film ofRita HayworthandGlenn Ford. Kahane would later become the President ofAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciencesin 1959, until his death a year later.
Columbia could not afford to keep a huge roster of contract stars, so Jack Cohn usually borrowed them from other studios. AtMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the industry's most prestigious studio, Columbia was nicknamed "Siberia", asLouis B. Mayerwould use the loan-out to Columbia as a way to punish his less-obedient signings. In the 1930s, Columbia signedJean Arthurto a long-term contract, and afterThe Whole Town's Talking(1935), Arthur became a major comedy star.Ann Sothern's career was launched when Columbia signed her to a contract in 1936.Cary Grantsigned a contract in 1937 and soon after it was altered to a non-exclusive contract shared withRKO.
Many theaters relied onwesternsto attract big weekend audiences, and Columbia always recognized this market. Its first cowboy star wasBuck Jones, who signed with Columbia in 1930 for a fraction of his former big-studio salary. Over the next two decades Columbia released scores of outdoor adventures with Jones,Tim McCoy,Ken Maynard,Jack Luden, Bob Allen (Robert (Tex) Allen),Russell Hayden,Tex Ritter,Ken Curtis, andGene Autry. Columbia's most popular cowboy wasCharles Starrett, who signed with Columbia in 1935 and starred in 131 western features over 17 years.[citation needed]
At Harry Cohn's insistence, the studio signedthe Three Stoogesin 1934. Rejected byMGM(which kept straight-manTed Healybut let the Stooges go),[14]the Stooges made 190 shorts for Columbia between 1934 and 1957. Columbia's short-subject department employed many famous comedians, includingBuster Keaton,Charley Chase,Harry Langdon,Andy Clyde, andHugh Herbert. Almost 400 of Columbia's 529 two-reel comedies were released to television between 1958 and 1961; to date, all of the Stooges, Keaton,Charley Chase,Shemp Howard,Joe Besser, andJoe DeRitasubjects have been released to home video.[15]
Columbia incorporated animation into its studio in 1929, distributingKrazy Katcartoons, taking over fromParamount. The following year, Columbia took over distribution of theMickey Mouseseries from Celebrity Productions until 1932. In 1933, The Mintz studio was re-established under theScreen Gemsbrand; Columbia's leading cartoon series wereKrazy Kat,Scrappy,The Fox and the Crow, and (very briefly)Li'l Abner.[16]Screen Gems was the last major cartoon studio to produce black-and-white cartoons, producing them until 1946. That same year, Screen Gems shut down but had completed enough cartoons for the studio to release until 1949. In 1948, Columbia agreed to release animated shorts fromUnited Productions of America; these new shorts were more sophisticated than Columbia's older cartoons, and many won critical praise and industry awards. In 1957, two years before the UPA deal was terminated, Columbia distributed theHanna-Barberacartoons, includingLoopy De Loopfrom 1959 to 1965, which was Columbia's final theatrical cartoon series. In 1967, the Hanna-Barbera deal expired and was not renewed.
According to Bob Thomas' bookKing Cohn, studio chief Harry Cohn always placed a high priority on serials. Beginning in 1937, Columbia entered the lucrative serial market and kept making these weekly episodic adventures until 1956, after other studios had discontinued them. The most famous Columbia serials are based on comic-strip or radio characters:Mandrake the Magician(1939),The Shadow(1940),Terry and the Pirates(1940),Captain Midnight(1942),The Phantom(1943),Batman(1943), and the especially successfulSuperman(1948), among many others.
Columbia also produced musical shorts, sports reels (usually narrated by sportscasterBill Stern), and travelogues. Its "Screen Snapshots" series, showing behind-the-scenes footage of Hollywood stars, was a Columbia perennial that the studio had been releasing since the silent-movie days; producer-directorRalph Staubkept this series going through 1958.
In the 1940s, propelled in part by the surge in audiences for their films duringWorld War II, the studio also benefited from the popularity of its biggest star,Rita Hayworth. Columbia maintained a long list of contractees well into the 1950s;Glenn Ford,Penny Singleton,William Holden,Judy Holliday,The Three Stooges,Ann Miller,Evelyn Keyes,Ann Doran,Jack Lemmon,Cleo Moore,Barbara Hale,Adele Jergens,Larry Parks,Arthur Lake,Lucille Ball,Kerwin MathewsandKim Novak.
Harry Cohn monitored the budgets of his films, and the studio got the maximum use out of costly sets, costumes, and props by reusing them in other films. Many of Columbia's low-budget"B" picturesand short subjects have an expensive look, thanks to Columbia's efficient recycling policy. Cohn was reluctant to spend lavish sums on even his most important pictures, and it was not until 1943 that he agreed to use three-stripTechnicolorin a live-action feature. Columbia was the last major studio to employ the expensive color process. Columbia's first Technicolor feature was the westernThe Desperadoes, starringRandolph ScottandGlenn Ford. Cohn quickly used Technicolor again forCover Girl, a Hayworth vehicle that instantly was a smash hit, released in 1944, and for the fanciful biography ofFrédéric Chopin,A Song to Remember, withCornel Wilde, released in 1945. Another biopic, 1946'sThe Jolson StorywithLarry ParksandEvelyn Keyes, was started in black-and-white, but when Cohn saw how well the project was proceeding, he scrapped the footage and insisted on filming in Technicolor.
In 1948, theUnited States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.anti-trustdecision forced Hollywood motion picture companies to divest themselves of the theater chains that they owned. Since Columbia did not own any theaters, it was now on equal terms with the largest studios. The studio soon replacedRKOon the list of the "Big Five" studios.
In 1946, Columbia dropped theScreen Gemsbrand from its cartoon line, but retained the Screen Gems name for various ancillary activities, including a 16 mm film-rental agency and a TV-commercial production company. On November 8, 1948, Columbia adopted theScreen Gems name for its television production subsidiarywhen the studio acquired Pioneer Telefilms, a television commercial company founded by Jack Cohn's son, Ralph.[17]Pioneer had been founded in 1947, and was later reorganized as Screen Gems.[17]The studio opened its doors for business in New York on April 15, 1949.[17]By 1951, Screen Gems became a full-fledged television studio and became a major producer ofsitcomsfor TV, beginning withFather Knows Bestand followed byThe Donna Reed Show,The Partridge Family,Bewitched,I Dream of Jeannie, andThe Monkees.
On July 1, 1956, studio veteran Irving Briskin stepped down as manager of Columbia Pictures and formed his own production company Briskin Productions, Inc. to release series through Screen Gems and supervise all of its productions.[18]On December 10, Screen Gems expanded intotelevision syndicationby acquiring Hygo Television Films (a.k.a. "Serials Inc.") and its affiliated company United Television Films, Inc. Hygo Television Films was founded in 1951 by Jerome Hyams, who also acquired United Television Films in 1955 that was founded by Archie Mayers.[19]
In 1957, two years before its parent company Columbia dropped UPA, Screen Gems entered a distribution deal withHanna-Barbera Productions, which produced classic animated series such asThe Flintstones,The Quick Draw McGraw Show,The Huckleberry Hound Show,The Yogi Bear Show,Jonny Quest,The JetsonsandTop Catamong others. Screen Gems distributed the company's shows until 1967, when Hanna-Barbera was sold toTaft Broadcasting. In 1960, the animation studio became a publicly traded company under the name Screen Gems, Inc., when Columbia spun off an 18% stake.
By 1950, Columbia had discontinued most of its popularseries films(Boston Blackie,Blondie,The Lone Wolf,The Crime Doctor,Rusty, etc.) OnlyJungle Jim, launched by producerSam Katzmanin 1949, kept going through 1955. Katzman contributed greatly to Columbia's success by producing dozens of topical feature films, includingcrime dramas,science-fictionstories, androck'n'rollmusicals. Columbia kept making serials until 1956 and two-reel comedies until 1957, after other studios had abandoned these mediums.
As the larger studios declined in the 1950s, Columbia's position improved. This was largely because it did not suffer from the massive loss of income that the other major studios suffered from the loss of their theaters (well over 90 percent, in some cases). Columbia continued to produce 40-plus pictures a year, offering productions that often broke ground and kept audiences coming to theaters. Some of its significant films from this era include the studio's adaptation of the controversialJames JonesnovelFrom Here to Eternity(1953),On the Waterfront(1954), andThe Bridge on the River Kwai(1957) withWilliam HoldenandAlec Guinness, all of which won theBest Picture Oscar. Another significant film of the studio was the free adaptation ofGeorge Orwell'sdystopian novelNineteen Eighty-Four(1956).
Columbia also released the productions of the English studioWarwick Films(by producersIrving AllenandAlbert R. Broccoli), as well as many films by producerCarl Foreman, who resided in England. Columbia distributed some films made byHammer, which was also based in England.
In December 1956, Jack Cohn, co-founder and executive vice-president, died.[20]In 1958, Columbia established its own record label,Colpix Records, initially run by Jonie Taps, who headed Columbia's music department, and laterPaul WexlerandLester Sill. Colpix was active until 1966 when Columbia entered into a joint agreement withRCA Victorand discontinued Colpix in favor of its new label,Colgems Records.
Shortly after closing their short subjects department, Columbia presidentHarry Cohndied of a heart attack in February 1958. His nephew Ralph Cohn died in 1959, ending almost four decades of family management.[21]
The new management was headed by Abe Schneider, who had joined the company as an office boy out of high school and become a director in 1929, rising through the financial side of the business.[22]In 1963, Columbia acquired music publisherAldon Music.[23]
By the late 1960s, Columbia had an ambiguous identity, offering old-fashioned fare such asA Man for All SeasonsandOliver!along with the more contemporaryEasy RiderandThe Monkees. After turning down releasingAlbert R. Broccoli'sEon ProductionsJames Bondfilms, Columbia hired Broccoli's former partnerIrving Allento produce theMatt Helmseries withDean Martin. Columbia also produced aJames Bondspoof,Casino Royale(1967), in conjunction withCharles K. Feldman, which held the adaptation rights forthat novel.
By 1966, the studio was suffering from box-office failures, and takeover rumors began surfacing. Columbia was surviving solely on the profits made from Screen Gems, whose holdings also included radio and television stations.[24]On December 23, 1968, Screen Gems merged with Columbia Pictures Corporation and became part of the newly formed Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. for $24.5 million.[25]Schneider was chairman of the holding company andLeo Jaffepresident.
Following the merger, in March 1969, CPI purchasedBell Recordsfor $3.5 million (mainly in CPI stock), retainingLarry Uttalas label president.
Nearly bankrupt by the early 1970s, the studio was saved via a radical overhaul: the Gower Street Studios (now called "Sunset Gower Studios") were sold and a new management team was brought in. In 1972, Columbia and Warner Bros. formed a partnership called The Burbank Studios, in which both companies shared theWarner studio lotinBurbank.
In 1971, Columbia Pictures established sheet music publisher Columbia Pictures Publications, with vice president and general managerFrank J. Hackinson, who later became the president.[26]
In 1973,Allen & Cotook a financial stake in Columbia Pictures Industries andAlan Hirschfieldwas appointed CEO,[27]succeedingLeo Jaffewho became chairman. Stanley Schneider, son of Abe Schneider (who became honorary chairman before leaving the board in 1975) was replaced as head of the Columbia Pictures studio byDavid Begelman, who reported to Hirschfield. Some years later Begelman was involved in a check-forging scandal that badly hurt the studio's image.
On May 6, 1974, Columbia retired theScreen Gemsname from television, renaming its television division to the name ofColumbia Pictures Television. The name was suggested byDavid Gerber, who was then president of Columbia's television division.[28]The same year, Columbia Pictures acquired Rastar Pictures, which included Rastar Productions, Rastar Features, and Rastar Television. Ray Stark then founded Rastar Films, the reincarnation of Rastar Pictures, which was acquired by Columbia Pictures in February 1980.[29]
Columbia Pictures also reorganized its music and record divisions.Clive Daviswas hired as a record and music consultant by Columbia Pictures in 1974 and later became temporary president ofBell Records. Davis's real goal was to revitalize Columbia Pictures' music division. With a $10 million investment by CPI, and a reorganization of the various Columbia Pictures legacy labels (Colpix,Colgems, and Bell), Davis introduced Columbia Pictures' new record division,Arista Records, in November 1974, with Davis himself owning 20% of the new venture. Columbia maintained control of the label until 1979, when it was sold toAriola Records. In addition, Columbia sold its music publishing business (Columbia-Screen Gems) toEMIin August 1976 for $15 million.[30]Both would later be reunited with Columbia Pictures under Sony ownership.
In December 1976, Columbia Pictures acquired the arcade game companyD. Gottlieb & Co.for $50 million.[31]
In 1978, Begelman was suspended for havingembezzledmoney from Columbia. Hirschfield was forced out for his refusal to reinstate him.[32][33]Begelman later resigned and was replaced byDaniel Melnickin June 1978.[34]Fay Vincentwas hired to replace Hirschfield.
Frank Pricebecame president of production in 1978. In March 1979, he would become president of Columbia Pictures, succeeding Melnick.[34]During Price's tenure he was responsible for turning out 9 of the top 10 grossing films in Columbia's history.[35]
In the fall of 1978,Kirk Kerkorian, a Vegas casino mogul who also controlledMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, acquired a 5.5% stake in Columbia Pictures.[36]He then announced on November 20, that he intended to launch a tender offer to acquire another 20% for the studio.[36]On December 14, a standstill agreement was reached with Columbia by promising not to go beyond 25% or seeking control for at least three years.[36]
On January 15, 1979, theUnited States Department of Justicefiled anantitrustsuit against Kerkorian to block him from holding a stake in Columbia while controlling MGM.[36]On February 19, 1979, Columbia Pictures Television acquired TOY Productions; the production company founded byBud Yorkinand writersSaul TurteltaubandBernie Orensteinin 1976.[37]In May, Kerkorian acquired an additional 214,000 shares in Columbia, raising his stake to 25%.[36]On August 2, the trial began; on August 14, the court ruled in favor for Kerkorian.[36]In 1979, Columbia agreed with Time-Life Video to release 20 titles onvideocassette.[38]
On September 30, 1980, Kerkorian sued Columbia for ignoring shareholders' interest and violating an agreement with him.[36]Columbia later accused him on October 2, of scheming withNelson Bunker Huntto gain control of Columbia.
In 1981, Kerkorian sold his 25% stake in Columbia back to CPI.[36]Columbia Pictures later acquired 81% ofThe Walter Reade Organization, which owned 11 theaters; it purchased the remaining 19% in 1985.
Around this time, Columbia putSteven Spielberg's proposed follow-up toClose Encounters of the Third Kind,Night Skies, intoturnaround. The project eventually became the highest-grossing film of the time,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Columbia received a share of the profits for its involvement in the development.[39]
On May 17, 1982, Columbia Pictures acquiredSpelling-Goldberg Productionsfor over $40 million.[40][41]With a healthier balance-sheet (due in large part to box office hits likeKramer vs. Kramer,Stir Crazy,The Blue Lagoon, andStripes) Columbia was bought by beverage companyThe Coca-Cola Companyon June 22, 1982, for $750 million.[42]Studio head Frank Price mixed big hits likeTootsie,Gandhi,The Karate Kid,The Big Chill, andGhostbusterswith many costly flops. To share the increasing cost of film production, Coke brought in two outside investors whose earlier efforts in Hollywood had come to nothing. In 1982, Columbia,Time Inc.'sHBOandCBSannounced, as a joint venture, "Nova Pictures"; this enterprise was to be renamedTri-Star Pictures.[43]In 1983, Price left Columbia Pictures after a dispute with Coca-Cola and went back to Universal.[44]He was replaced byGuy McElwaine.[45]
In the early 1980s, Columbia and Tri-Star Pictures set up a film partnership with Delphi Film Associates and acquired an interest in various film releases. In 1984, Delphi Film Associates III acquired an interest in the Tri-Star and Columbia film slate of 1984, which would make a $60 million offering in the financing of film production.[46]Also that year, Columbia Pictures had bought out the rights toHardbodies, which was once premiered onThe Playboy Channel.[47]
Columbia Pictures expanded its music publishing operations in the 1980s, acquiring Big 3 Publishing (the former sheet music operations of Robbins,Feist, andMiller) fromMGM/UA Communications Co.in 1983, Belwin-Mills Publishing fromSimon & Schusterin 1985, and Al Gallico Music in 1987.[48][49][50]
On June 18, 1985, Columbia's parent acquiredNorman LearandJerry Perenchio's Embassy Communications, Inc. (includingEmbassy Pictures, Embassy Television,Tandem Productions, and Embassy Home Entertainment), mostly for its library of television series such asAll in the FamilyandThe Jeffersons, for $485 million.[51]On November 16, 1985, CBS dropped out of the Tri-Star venture.[52]
Many changes occurred in 1986. Expanding its television franchise, on May 5, Columbia's parent also boughtMerv Griffin Enterprisesfor $250 million. The company was notable for:Wheel of Fortune,Jeopardy!,Dance Fever, andThe Merv Griffin Show.[53][54]Months later on August 28, the Columbia Pictures Television Group acquiredDanny Arnold's Danny Arnold Productions, Inc.. The deal included Arnold's rights to the sitcomBarney Miller(Four D Productions) among other produced series such asFish(The Mimus Corporation),A.E.S. Hudson Street(Triseme Corporation), andJoe Bash(Tetagram Ltd.). Arnold had dropped the federal and state lawsuits against the television studio, who was accusing them ofantitrustviolations, fraud, and breach offiduciary duty.[55][56][57]
Coca-Cola sold the Embassy Pictures division toDino de Laurentiis, who later folded Embassy Pictures into Dino de Laurentiis Productions, Inc. The company was renamed asDe Laurentiis Entertainment Group. Coca-Cola also sold Embassy Home Entertainment toNelson Entertainment. Coca-Cola, however, retained the Embassy Pictures name, logo, and trademark. HBO was the last partner to drop out of the Tri-Star venture and sold its shares to Columbia[58]Tri-Star later expanded into the television business with its new Tri-Star Television division.
The same year, Columbia recruited British producerDavid Puttnamto head the studio. Puttnam attempted to defy Hollywood filmmaking by making smaller films instead of big tentpole pictures. His criticism of American film production, in addition to the fact that the films he greenlit were mostly flops, left Coke and Hollywood concerned.[clarification needed]
Puttnam then discontinued multi-picture pacts with various filmmakers, includingNorman Jewison, which was permitted to expire before all of the promised product could be delivered.[59]Under Puttnam's control, he set up a $270 million package of in-house pictures and acquisitions, and the average lineup of 25 features was expected to be $10.78 million, about $4 million less of the cost at Columbia before Puttnam came on board, and a number of low-cost acquisitions such asSpike Lee's $5 million pictureSchool Daze.[60]
On October 22, 1986, Greg Coote was appointed by Columbia Pictures as key executive of the studio, to complement David Puttman's pledge on Columbia Pictures to fix its sights over its international market.[61]On December 17, 1986, the company acquired a 30% share in Roadshow, Coote & Carroll, a company Greg Coote headed, and decided that they would pick up films and miniseries to put an effort to add it up to Columbia's shares, and listed dozens of theatrical and television films and dozens of miniseries throughout the addition of the Columbia slate.[62]
On June 26, 1987, Coca-Cola sold The Walter Reade Organization toCineplex Odeon Corporation.[63]On October 14, 1987, Coca-Cola's entertainment division invested in $30 million inCastle Rock Entertainmentwith five Hollywood executives. Coke's entertainment business division owned 40% in Castle Rock, while the execs owned 60%.[64]
The volatile film business made Coke shareholders nervous, and following the critical and box-office failure ofIshtar, Coke spun off its entertainment holdings on December 21, 1987, and sold it to Tri-Star Pictures for $3.1 billion. Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. (CPE), with Coke owning 80% of the company.[65]Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names.[66]
Puttnam was ousted from the position after only one year.[67]Puttnam was succeeded byDawn Steel. Other small-scale, "boutique" entities were created:Nelson Entertainment, a joint venture with British and Canadian partners,Triumph Films, jointly owned with French studioGaumont, and which is now a low-budget label, andCastle Rock Entertainment.
On January 2, 1988, Columbia/Embassy Television and Tri-Star Television were formed into the new Columbia Pictures Television and Embassy Communications was renamed as ELP Communications to serve as a copyright holder of the Embassy television productions. In early 1988, CPE relaunchedTriumph Filmsas Triumph Releasing Corporation, which handled administrative services related to distribution of Columbia and Tri-Star's films for the North American market, while Triumph was responsible for the sales, marketing and distribution of Columbia andTri-Starfilms under the direction of each individual studio internationally, with Patrick N. Williamson serving as head of Triumph.[68]
On January 16, 1988, CPE's stock fell slightly in the market on its first day trading in theNew York Stock Exchange. Coke spun off 34.1 million of its Columbia shares to its shareholders by reducing its stake in CPE from 80% to 49%.[69]On April 13, 1988, CPE spun off Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. as a reformed company of the Tri-Star studio.[70]In April 1988, CPE sold its music publishing operations to the British company Filmtrax.[71](Filmtrax was acquired byThorn EMIin 1990.)[72]In June 1988, CPE announced the sale of Columbia Pictures Publications (consisting of the print music operations) to the investment firm Boston Ventures and was renamed CPP/Belwin.[73]CPP/Belwin was acquired byWarner Chappell Musicof Warner Bros. in 1994.[74]
On February 2, 1989, Columbia Pictures Television formed a joint-venture with Norman Lear's Act III Communications called Act III Television (now Act III Productions) to produce television series instead of managing.[75][76]
On September 28, 1989, the Columbia Pictures empire was sold to the electronics giantSony, one of severalJapanese firms then buying American properties, for the amount of $3.4 billion.[77]The sale netted Coca-Cola a profit from its investment in the studio.[78][79]Sony then hired two producers,Peter GuberandJon Peters, to serve as coheads of production when Sony also acquired the Guber-Peters Entertainment Company (the former game show production company,Barris Industries) for $200 million on September 29, 1989.[80]Guber and Peters had just signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros. in 1989, having been with the company since 1983. Warner Bros., then a subsidiary ofWarner Communications, sued Sony for $1 billion.[81]Sony completed CPE's acquisition on November 8, and the Guber-Peters acquisition was completed on the following day.
On December 1, 1989, Guber and Peters hired a longtime lawyer of GPEC, Alan J. Levine, to the post of president and COO of Columbia's newly formed company Filmed Entertainment Group (FEG).[82]FEG consisted of Columbia Pictures, Tri-Star Pictures, Triumph Releasing, Columbia Pictures Television, Columbia Pictures Television Distribution, Merv Griffin Enterprises, RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video (internationally known as RCA/Columbia Pictures International Video), Guber-Peters Entertainment Company, and ancillary and distribution companies.
In 1990, Sony ended up paying hundreds of millions of dollars, gave up a half-interest in itsColumbia House Records Clubmail-order business, and bought fromTime Warnerthe formerMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) studio lot in Culver City, which Warner Communications had acquired in its takeover ofLorimar-Telepicturesin 1989, thus ending the Burbank Studios partnership. Initially renamedColumbia Studios, Sony spent $100 million to refurbish the rechristenedSony Pictures Studioslot.
Guber and Peters set out to prove they were worth this fortune, but though there were to be some successes, there were also many costly flops. The same year,Frank Pricewas made the chairman of Columbia Pictures. His company Price Entertainment, Inc., which he founded in 1987, was merged with Columbia in March 1991. Price left Columbia on October 4, 1991, and was replaced by Warner Bros. executiveMark Cantonand reactivated Price Entertainment as Price Entertainment Company with a nonexclusive deal with SPE.[83]Peters was fired by his partner Guber in 1991, but Guber later resigned in 1994 to formMandalay Entertainmentthe following year.[84]The entire operation was reorganized and renamed Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) on August 7, 1991,[85]and at the same time, TriStar (which had officially lost its hyphen) relaunched its television division in October. In December 1991, SPE createdSony Pictures Classicsfor arthouse fare and was headed byMichael Barker,Tom Bernard, and Marcie Bloom,[86]who previously operatedUnited Artists ClassicsandOrion Classics.

Sony traded theCasino Royalerights for $10 million, as well as theSpider-Manfilming rights.[96]The superhero became Columbia's most successfulfranchise:[97]The first moviecame out in 2002, and as of 2021, there have been seven follow-up movies with US grosses in excess of $2.5 billion.[98]Between the releases of the first and second sequels in 2004 and 2007, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, giving it distribution rights to theJames Bondfranchise.

Two years later, CPT was folded into CTT as well.
In the 2000s, Sony broadened its release schedule by backingRevolution Studios, the production/distribution company headed byJoe Roth. On October 25, 2001, CTT and Columbia TriStar Television Distribution (CTTD) merged to form Columbia TriStar Domestic Television.[101]On September 16, 2002, Columbia TriStar Domestic Television was renamedSony Pictures Television.[102]Also in 2002, Columbia broke the record for biggest domestic theatrical gross, with a tally of $1.575 billion, coincidentally breaking its own record of $1.256 billion, set in 1997. The 2002 gross was primarily raised by such blockbusters asSpider-Man,Men in Black II, andXXX.[103]
The studio was also the most lucrative of 2004,[103]with over $1.338 billion in the domestic box office with films such asSpider-Man 2,50 First Dates, andThe Grudge,[104]and in 2006. Columbia's box office successes of 2006 included such blockbusters asThe Da Vinci Code,The Pursuit of Happyness,Monster House,Casino Royale, andOpen Season.

On January 10, 2024, Sony Pictures celebrated the centennial anniversary of the founding of Columbia Pictures with a new motion logo; the centennial print logo was previously revealed on November 14, 2023.[116][117]The motion logo, which was used throughout Columbia's 2024 slate, made its theatrical debut in the 2024 re-release ofSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse(2023).[118]
The Columbia Pictures logo, featuring the Torch Lady, a woman carrying a torch and wearing a drape (representingColumbia, apersonificationof the United States), has gone through five major changes.[119][120][121]It has often been compared to theStatue of Liberty, which was an inspiration to the Columbia Pictures logo.[121]
Originally in 1924, Columbia Pictures used a logo featuring a female Roman soldier holding a shield in her left hand and a stick of wheat in her right hand, which was based on actressDoris Doscher(known as the model for the statue on thePulitzer Fountain) as theStanding Liberty quarterused from 1916 to 1930, though the studio's version was given longer hair.[122]The logo changed in 1928 with a new woman wearing a drapedflagand torch. The woman wore aheaddress, thestolaand carried thepallaofancient Rome, and above her were the words "A Columbia Production" ("A Columbia Picture" or "Columbia Pictures Corporation") written in an arch. The illustration was based upon the actressEvelyn Venable, known for providing the voice of theBlue FairyinWalt Disney'sPinocchio.
An alternative logo in tandem with the 1924 and 1928 versions that used the slogan "Gems of the Screen"; itself a takeoff on the song "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean", later inspired the renaming of the Charles Mintz Studio intoScreen Gems.[citation needed]
In 1936, the logo was changed into the well known classic look: the Torch Lady now stood on a pedestal, wore no headdress, and the text "Columbia" appeared in chiseled letters behind her. A new form of animation was used on the logo as well, with a torch that radiates light instead of flickers.Pittsburghnative Jane Chester Bartholomew, whomHarry Cohndiscovered working as an extra at Columbia, portrayed the Torch Lady in the logo. There were several variations to the logo over the years—significantly, a color version was done in 1943 forThe Desperadoes.[121]Two years earlier, the flag became just a drape with no markings.[119][120]The latter change came after a federal law was passed making it illegal to wear an American flag as clothing. In the 1950s, the woman's robe was redrawn and shaded with a plunging neckline and an exposed slipper-clad foot. 1976'sTaxi Driverwas one of the last films released before the "Torch Lady" was revamped.
From 1955 to 1963, Columbia used the woman from the 1936 logo under the Screen Gems banner, officially billing itself as part of "the Hollywood studios of Columbia Pictures", as spoken at the end of some Screen Gems series.
From 1976 to 1993,[119]Columbia Pictures used two logos. The first, from 1976 to 1981 (or from 1975 for promotional material until 1982 for international territories) used just a sunburst representing the beams from the torch, although the woman appears briefly in the opening logo. The score accompanying the first logo was composed bySuzanne Ciani. The studio hired visual effects pioneerRobert Abelto animate the first logo.[123]The image was created with over fifty light exposures that included streak and special filter passes. The woman returned in 1981, but in a much smoother form described as resembling aCoke bottle.[119]During the studio's run with Coca-Cola, a golden version of the Torch Lady was used for the Columbia Pictures Television logo with the byline "A unit of the Coca-Cola Company" from 1982 to 1987 until it was replaced with the 1981 version and the byline was removed after Coke sold Columbia to Sony. The slogans for the 1976 and 1981 logos were "Let us entertain you" and "Movies That Matter", respectively.
From 1982 to 1985, Columbia used the 1981 logo for Triumph Films, with the woman under theArc De Triomphein the logo. The 1981 logo along with the 1936 and 1976 versions would be later used in 21st century Columbia releases, generally to match the year a given film is set in.
In 1992, the longest-running, and perhaps best known, iteration of the logo was created; the television division was the first to use it. Films began to use the new logo the year after, when Scott Mednick and the Mednick Group were hired by Peter Guber to create logos for all the entertainment properties then owned by Sony Pictures.[124]Mednick hired New Orleans artistMichael Deas,[125]to digitally repaint the logo and return the woman to her "classic" look.[126]An urban legend is that actressAnnette Beningwas the model for the current logo. Bening's face was later superimposed onto the Torch Lady in the opening intro ofWhat Planet Are You From?(2000) as an inside joke. Michael Deas hired Jennifer Joseph, a 28-year-old graphics artist forThe Times-Picayune, as a model for the logo.[127]Due to time constraints, she agreed to help out on her lunch break. It was the first and only time she ever modeled. Joseph had recently discovered she was pregnant at the time.[128]Deas also hiredThe Times-Picayunephotographer Kathy Anderson to photograph the reference photography.[129]The animation was created by Synthespian Studios in 1993 by Jeff Kleiser andDiana Walczak, who used 2D elements from the painting and converted it to 3D.[130]The studio being part of Sony would not be referenced on-screen until 1996. VHS promos featured the current logo with a stylized "75" behind the Torch Lady, commemorating the studio's 75th anniversary in 1999 with the slogan, "Lighting Up Screens Around the World". In 2012, the current logo was displayed as a painting at theOgden Museum of Southern Artin New Orleans. Deas gave an interview toWWL-TV: "I never thought it would make it to the silver screen and I never thought it would still be up 20 years later, and I certainly never thought it would be in a museum, so it's kind of gratifying."[131]On November 14, 2023, Sony unveiled a special centennial logo ahead the studios’ 100th anniversary, consisting of the current Torch Lady within a stylized “100” and later posted an animation that showcases the older logos in the same vein as theSpider-Versefilms on January 10, 2024, the 100th anniversary of the founding of Columbia Pictures. This logo was used on Columbia's 2024 releases.[132]
The current logo was also used forScreen Gems Networkand Columbia Showcase theatre, both now defunct programming blocks that featured syndicated airings of Sony Pictures-owned shows and films, respectively.

Olyphant was born inHonolulu,Hawaii, but moved toModesto, Californiaat the age of two.[3]His parents are Katherine (néeGideon) and John Vernon Bevan Olyphant, who worked as vice president of production atGallo Winery.[4][5][6][7][8]He has an older brother, Andrew, and a younger brother, Matthew.[9]His parents divorced when he was a teenager; both remarried.[10][11][12]He is of English, German, Scottish, Dutch, Irish, and one-eighthRussian-Jewishancestry.[13][14]
Olyphant is a descendant of theVanderbilt familyof New York. His paternal fourth great-grandfather was family patriarchCornelius Vanderbilt.[15]The surnameOlyphantis of Scottish origin.[3]Another paternal fourth great-grandfather, Dr. David Olyphant, was born in Scotland and served as director-general of the Southern hospitals during theAmerican Revolutionary War.[16]His third great-grandfather,David Olyphant, and great-great-grandfather,Robert Morrison Olyphant, were both prominent businessmen.[17][18][19]
Olyphant attended Modesto'sFred C. Beyer High School.[20]Growing up, he was "embarrassed" by the idea of acting, but enjoyed art and drawing.[21][22]He swam competitively throughout his childhood and was a finalist at the 1986Nationals, in the200m Individual Medley.[23][24]He was then recruited to theUniversity of Southern CaliforniabyUSC Trojansswimming coachPeter Daland.[25][26]When Olyphant first visited the campus as part of a recruitment trip, he hoped to study architecture but was told it would be unmanageable with his training schedule.[21][27][28]
Instead, he opted to earn aBachelor of Fine Arts.[3]However, Olyphant left university one elective shy of a degree; he returned to finish the degree 30 years later, taking an online course during theCOVID-19 pandemic.[29]In 1990, he planned to finish his degree and apply for amaster's degree in fine artsand half-heartedly considered a career incommercial art.[22][30]While working as a swimming coach atIrvine Novaquatics,[31][32]Olyphant decided to move to New York to explore other options.[27]He initially performedstand-up comedy: "I'd dabbled [before] and then there was a six-month period where I did it with a certain commitment. Then I'd occasionally go back."[22][30][33][34]Ultimately, he decided to become an actor. In his final year of college, he had taken an acting class as an elective atUC Irvineand found it "really enjoyable".[3][35]He completed a two-year acting program at New York'sWilliam Esper Studioand began auditioning for roles.[36][37][38]
Olyphant's first paid acting job was in a 1995WBtelevision pilot based on77 Sunset Strip.Phyllis Huffmancast him in the role but he did not have an opportunity to meet the show's producer,Clint Eastwood, who quit days before filming began.[39][40]Later that year, he made his professionalOff Broadwaydebut in thePlaywrights Horizons' production ofThe Monogamist[41][42]and received theTheatre World Award for Outstanding Debut Performance.[43]He starred in the world premiere ofThe SantaLand Diaries(1996) at theAtlantic Theater Company, a one-man play based onDavid Sedaris' essay about working as aMacy'sdepartment store Christmas elf.[44]Ben Brantley ofThe New York Timesfelt the "charming" Olyphant did "a wonderful job" when imitating other characters but had "a harder time finding a convincing style for the running narrative".[45]Howard Kissell ofThe New York Daily Newsremarked that he delivered "all the drollery with a perfect deadpan and a twinkle"[46]while David Patrick Stearns ofUSA Todaydescribed him as "an excellent young actor who successfully projects the world-weariness of a young 20-something who slowly evolves into somebody who just might believe in Christmas."[47]
Olyphant made his feature film debut inThe First Wives Club(1996) as an eager young director who attempts to cast Elise Elliot (Goldie Hawn) – who thinks she will be playing the leading lady – in the role of the elderly mother.[48]Airing on the same day of that film's release, he made his television debut in the pilot of theCBSspy seriesMr. & Mrs. Smith.[49][50]In 1997, Olyphant made a guest appearance as Officer Brett Farraday in three episodes of theABCpolice dramaHigh Incident[51]and returned to New York's Playwrights Horizons to play a supporting role inPlunge.[52]He also had minor roles in the romantic comedyA Life Less Ordinary[53]and the CBS television filmEllen Foster.[54]Olyphant's most high-profile role of 1997 was as a film student later revealed as one of the killers in the successful horror filmScream 2, bringing "a degree of wild-eyed flair to the role," according toHitFix's Chris Eggertsen.[55][56]He later described the role as "a gift. I had virtually nothing on my resume at that point. I'm sure some of it was made up."[56]
Olyphant returned to television in 1998 for a guest starring role in an episode of theHBOsitcomSex and the City, playing a love interest forCarrie Bradshaw.Sarah Jessica Parkerlater said the episode, "Valley of the Twenty Something Guys", was her favorite of the series.[57]Also that year, he had supporting roles in the HBO war filmWhen Trumpets Fade[58]and the independent ensemble drama1999.[59][60]Two little-seen films were released in 1999: the dramaAdvice from a Caterpillar, in which Olyphant played the bisexual love interest ofCynthia Nixon's character,[61][62]and the offbeat ensemble comedyNo Vacancy, in which he starred withChristina Ricci.[63]Olyphant received positive notices for portraying a drug dealer in the cult comedyGo(1999).[8][37][64]Janet Maslin ofThe New York Timesnoted that the role was "played with offbeat flair"[65][66]while Todd McCarthy ofVarietydescribed it as a "deftly etched" performance.[67]He was set to star in the fantasy filmPractical Magic, but he was replaced byAidan Quinn.[68][69]
After Olyphant's performance inGo, the film's producerMickey Liddelloffered him his choice of parts in his next projectThe Broken Hearts Club(2000), a romantic comedy about a group of gay friends living in West Hollywood.[70][71][72]The Village Voice's Dennis Lim commented that his leading performance was better than the film deserved: "Olyphant is charismatic enough for his worst lines not to stick."[73]However, Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chroniclefelt he played the part "like a straight actor gaying it up".[74]Olyphant played a detective in the successful action filmGone in 60 Seconds(2000) and joked in an interview about the challenges of playing "second fiddle to a car";[48][75]his performance reminded theWashington Post's Stephen Hunter of a youngBill Paxton.[76]
Olyphant was offered a starring role for a character calledDominic Torettoin another car film calledRedline– that would later be retitledThe Fast and the Furious. According to Sony producerNeal H. Moritz, "The studio said, 'If you can get Timothy Olyphant to play that role we will greenlight the movie.'" Olyphant declined the role, which went toVin Diesel. The film went on to be a massive success withnine sequelsto date.[77]Olyphant later discussed passing on a lot of roles earlier in his career. In 2011, when asked byThe Hollywood Reporterwhat was the most absurd project he had ever been pitched, he replied, "I've passed on absurd projects and they have become enormous, enormous hits spawning numerous sequels, and I'm not in them."[78]In 2018, he reflected on passing on the role of Toretto inThe Fast and the Furious, thinking it would be "stupid" and would bomb at the box office.[79]
Olyphant also had supporting roles in the musical comedyRock Star,[40]the crime dramaAuggie Rose,[80][81]and the romantic comedyHead Over Heels(all 2001). He starred in the short filmDoppelganger(2001)[82]and appeared in an episode of theSci-Fi Channelhorror seriesNight Visions(2002).[83]
The independent dramaCoastlinesmade its debut at the 2002SXSW Festival, but failed to find a distributor until 2006.[84][85]Olyphant starred oppositeJosh Brolinas an ex-con who returns to his Florida hometown to collect a $200,000 debt. Kevin Crust of theLos Angeles Timeswrote that he "possesses the kind of thousand-yard stare that suggests something deeper going on,"[86]while Owen Gleiberman ofEntertainment Weeklyremarked that "Olyphant, in the sort of role thatPaul Newmanused to swagger through, has a star's easy command."[87]However, Todd McCarthy ofVarietyfelt his performance "sort of floats along".[88]
Olyphant's most high-profile role of 2003 was in the Vin Diesel-starring action filmA Man Apart. Desson Howe of theWashington Postremarked that Olyphant "gets a kudo or two for [having] the good sense to realize he's playing one of the movie's many one-dimensional characters, so he might as well have insane fun".[89]Similarly, Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chroniclenoted that "the most lively character in "A Man Apart" turns out [to be] a middling drug dealer played to the hilt by Timothy Olyphant."[90]He appeared in thefilm adaptationofStephen King's horror novelDreamcatcheras one of four friends attacked by parasitic aliens.[91][92][93]The film was poorly reviewed, with David Rooney ofVarietyremarking: "OnlyLeeand Olyphant come close to hitting the right note of tongue-in-cheek humor that might have made all this palatable. Unfortunately, they're the first to go."[94]Also in 2003, he appeared in the independent ensemble dramaThe Safety of Objects.[70][95][96]
Olyphant received widespread praise for his 2004 performance as a porn film producer in the comedyThe Girl Next Door.[97][98][99]He was initially reluctant to audition for the part, feeling it was too similar to some of his previous roles but, "as my manager dutifully reminded me, not many people saw those movies."[75]Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chronicledescribed the character of Kelly as "a leering, magnetic, frightening, glad-handing, easily-amused, hyper-sensitive, utterly deceitful, maddeningly likable wild man. When Olyphant is on screen, there's the feeling that things might go anywhere."[100]A.O. Scott ofThe New York Timesremarked that the part was played with "a throwaway inventiveness"[101]while Kenneth Turan of theLos Angeles Timesfelt it was played "with wonderful comic zest".[102]David Edelstein ofSlateenjoyed his "spaced-out volatility. Olyphant's Kelly is a brilliant synthesis of poses."[103]Joe Leydon ofVarietysaid he "strikes an impressively deft balance of hearty amiability and understated menace in his scene-stealing turn".[104]
In a 2015 interview, Olyphant reflected on the early stages of his film career, and not getting the leading roles that would have possibly led to major fame: "I got great opportunities right off the bat. And at the same time I either passed or failed to get things that would have made things ridiculously quick. I passed on enormous opportunities only to end up playing the supporting role in the next film. And then I'd think to myself, "What the fuck am I doing? Why did I do that?" But sometimes I feel like I got away with some things, because I've been able to work for a long time and I haven't had to deal with any kind of fame issues."[105]
Olyphant came to the attention of a wider audience when he was cast as SheriffSeth Bullockin HBO's acclaimed westernDeadwood, which aired for three seasons from 2004 to 2006.[75]While he had previously been typecast "as a talkative,Jack Nicholson–styled, funny bad boy," in the words ofVulture'sMatt Zoller Seitz,[106][107]Deadwoodgave him the opportunity to play a righteous, brooding lawman.[108][109][110][111]The show's creator,David Milch, said of the casting choice: "Bullock's uprightness is an alternative to going medieval on people. You can see that same fire and that possibility in Tim, even at his most genial ... I'm not sure which poet talked about 'thoughts too deep for words,' but he brings that idea alive ... Tim is a guy that doesn't let himself be known easily."[64][112][113]
While Bullock was initially introduced asDeadwood's protagonist, Emily VanDerWerff ofThe A.V. Clubnoted that the character ofAl Swearengencame to "dominate the show ... This is not to slight Timothy Olyphant. He's a fine actor, and his portrayal of Bullock is frequently very, very good. Bullock is still unquestionably one of the most important characters on the show but the character of a Wild West lawman, no matter how revisionist it was in its portrayal of that lawman as someone who seemed barely in control at all times, just ended up not having as much to do in a blatantly revisionist Western about how chaos gives way to civilization."[114]Matt Feeney ofSlatedescribed Bullock as "laconic, feral, hot-tempered and a little vain", and said the character was "not so much played as embodied by Olyphant".[115]Alan Sepinwall ofHitFixfound his performance "fierce and commanding"[116]while Jeremy Egner ofThe New York Timessaid that he showed "a capacity for explosive, nuanced performance barely suggested by earlier roles".[64]The cast were nominated for the 2006Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.[53]
Years later, Olyphant remarked thatDeadwood"almost has done more for me since we wrapped than while it was on. I continue to draw from it, to steal from it. I'm much better at my job now because of the things I learned while doing it. David Milch is one of the greatest writers, storytellers, directors, creative forces I've ever been around."[117]He has been somewhat critical of his own performance: "Frankly, the show is much better than my performance ...Ianwas like a little kid, playing with the props and playing with the language and he never lost the sense of fun of it all. I wasn't operating at that same level."[118][119]
Also in 2006, he made a guest appearance in an episode of theNBCcomedyMy Name Is Earl.[120]In 2007, Olyphant starred in the romantic comedyCatch and Release. He knew co-starJennifer Garnerfrom their days as struggling actors in New York, and was excited for the opportunity to play a romantic lead.[7][53][121]Lael Loewenstein ofVarietyfelt "Olyphant clearly has a bright future"[122]while Desson Thomson of theWashington Postdescribed him as "the strongest performer here" but that he was "entirely misplaced, an estimable actor caught in a thankless, frilly role".[123]Scott Tobias ofThe A.V. Clubremarked: "Olyphant's trademark volatility makes him a livelier romantic lead than the usual stuffed shirt."[124]Similarly, Stephanie Zacharek ofSalonfound him "effective here precisely because he seems a little sharp and dangerous. He's not your typical cuddly romantic lead."[125]
Olyphant's first post-Deadwoodroles were the action moviesLive Free or Die HardandHitman(both 2007). (Coastlineswas first screened during the Sundance Film Festival in 2002[126]whileCatch and Releasewas filmed in 2005.[127]) He had bought a house in the weeks beforeDeadwood's cancellation[128][129]and he later admitted his job choices during this period were for "purely financial reasons".[21]InLive Free or Die Hard, he played a villainous cybersecurity expert.[53][110][130]Both he andBruce Willishave said his role was underwritten in the script, and he enjoyed working with Willis to develop the character.[131][132][133]Peter Travers ofRolling Stonedeclared him "a master at smiling menace",[134]while Mick LaSalle ofThe San Francisco Chroniclefound him "perfectly ice cold".[135]However,Manohla DargisofThe New York Timesremarked: "Mr. Olyphant has many charms, but annihilating menace is not one of them."[136]He next starred inHitman, a video game adaptation, as the assassinAgent 47.[7][137][138]He was hired to replace Vin Diesel six weeks before filming began[139][140]and reluctantly agreed to shave his head.[132][141]The film was commercially successful, grossing over $100 million,[142]but received negative reviews. Todd McCarthy ofVarietydescribed Olyphant as "an actor capable of portraying subtle ambiguities and thought, which suggests he ought to branch out to play something other than baddies".[143]Nick Schager ofSlant Magazinewas disappointed to see the actor "reduced to glowering and posing with pistols"[144]while Manohla Dargis ofThe New York Timesfelt he was "strangely, at times ridiculously, miscast".[145]In 2008, he had a supporting role as alieutenant colonelin theIraq WardramaStop-Loss,[53][146]played a pompous newscaster in the little-seen comedyMeet Bill,[147]voiced the character Cowboy in the video gameTurok[148]and made a guest appearance on the first season of the ABC sitcomSamantha Who?withChristina Applegate.[149][150]
Olyphant had a new outlook when choosing his 2009 projects, influenced by his experience withHitman: "It motivated me to take a little more responsibility with what I was doing ... I was very fond of the director and a lot of the people that worked on the film but there was definitely a part of me that was like, "What am I doing here?'"[64][151][152]He starred as a morphine addict in the little-seen independent heist comedyHigh Life,[153][154][155]with Derek Elley ofVarietypraising his "terrific" performance.[156][157]He had a starring role in the thrillerA Perfect Getawayas a possible serial killer of fellow holidaymakers in Hawaii. Manohla Dargis ofThe New York Timesenjoyed "the regrettably underemployed" actor's performance,[158]Ty Burr of theBoston Globefound him "delightfully confident"[159]while Lisa Schwarzbaum ofEntertainment Weeklynoted he "has a heckuva good time telegraphing macho mania".[160]He was nominated for theToronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor.[161]He returned to the stage for one night to appear inStanding on Ceremony: The Gay Marriage Plays, benefiting theHuman Rights Campaign.[162][163]Also in 2009, he appeared in 11 episodes of theFXlegal thrillerDamages, as a morally ambiguous love interest forRose Byrne's character.[164][165]Byrne later said he was her favoriteDamagesguest star,[166][167]while FX presidentJohn Landgrafsent him the pilot script for another FX project,Lawman(later renamedJustified).[113][117]In 2010, he starred as the town sheriff in the horror filmThe Crazies.[151][168]Peter Bradshaw ofThe Guardianwas impressed by the "saturnine screen presence of Timothy Olyphant – that formidable actor who deserves a lead role to match his potential."[169]The Hollywood Reporter's Michael Rechtshaffen found him "convincing"[170]while Claudia Puig ofUSA Todayenjoyed the "smart, stoic and sympathetic" performance.[171]He also appeared in the independent comedyElektra Luxx(2010).[172][173]
Olyphant starred in FX's modern-day western series,Justified, as Deputy U.S. MarshalRaylan Givens, who is reassigned to his native Eastern Kentucky following a "Justified," but questionable, quick-draw shooting of a criminal in Miami. There, he encounters many outlaw figures from his childhood, including his father and Boyd Crowder, with whom he dug coal as a teenager.[174]Olyphant was initially drawn to "the ease and the charm and the sort of old-fashionedness" of the character[152]but has said he does not consider him a "good guy".[64][174][175][176]The character of Raylan Givens was created by novelistElmore Leonard, appearing in his short story "Fire in the Hole" (2001) and the novelsPronto(1993) andRiding the Rap(1995). Leonard was an executive producer ofJustifiedand befriended Olyphant;[177][178][179]his final novel,Raylan(2012), was inspired by the television show.[180]
Raylan Givens has been described by many television critics as the "defining role" of Olyphant's career.[64][181][182]Brian Lowry ofVarietysaid it was "an unabashed star turn": "There are surely worse ways to be pigeonholed than playing tough, laconic lawmen, and Timothy Olyphant is carving himself a formidable niche in those confines ... It's an enormously appealing performance."[183]Tim Goodman of theSan Francisco Chroniclepraised "an incredibly riveting performance": "Olyphant's steely gaze, Zen interior and matinee looks called to mind a younger Clint Eastwood."[184]Daniel Fienberg ofHitFixdescribed him as "a tremendously compelling actor. It's not that he thrives only on minimalism, but he gets a lot out of a little. His performance is about potential energy, or potential violence. And Olyphant does "intense and coiled" to perfection."[185]Matthew Gilbert ofThe Boston Globesaid: "It's hard to imagine any other actor in the part, as Olyphant milks Raylan's smooth, laconic cowboy style for as much wry humor as he can. He is riveting without a lot of noise — both his body language and his conversation are pared down, and yet his presence is always resonant."[186]Although Olyphant was nominated for aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Seriesin 2011,[187]he and the show were often perceived to have been "snubbed" by Emmy voters.[188][189][190][191]Matt Zoller Seitz ofVulturesuggested this was because it was "the kind of performance that almost nobody recognizes as 'acting.' It's an old-fashioned movie hero performance in which much of the emotional action is internal and articulated with great subtlety."[192]Similarly, Robert Bianco ofUSA Todaycommented that his "masterfully complete immersion in the role seems to have masked the talent expended playing it".[193]
Olyphant also served as a co-executive producer onJustified, working withGraham Yostand the writing team on some of the show's storylines and coming to the set on his days off to work with guest stars.[64][152][194][113]He has described producing as "the greatest thing about this job".[175]Yost has said of his producer credit: "Often on shows that really doesn't mean much. On this show it actually doesn't reflect the depth of his involvement, which would be an even bigger credit. Tim is the biggest reminder for everyone that we're in the Elmore Leonard world. And that it needs to be funny and dark and twisted, and it needs to speak with all of those voices at the same time."[64]Justifiedwas awarded aPeabody Awardin 2011.[195]
Olyphant made occasional guest appearances on comedy television shows duringJustified's six-season run. He played a paper salesman in two episodes of the NBC comedyThe Office(2010), afterMindy Kaling, a writer, producer and actress on the show, pushed for him to make a guest appearance.[196][197][198]In 2012, he played a character billed as White Sushi Chef in an episode of the FX sitcomThe League(2012)[199]and voiced a character in an episode of the FX animated seriesArcher.[200][201]In 2013, he appeared as a love interest on theFoxcomedyThe Mindy Project. The guest appearance came about after he told Kaling that he wanted to appear on the show[202][203]and he later said he would have been happy to play his middle-aged skateboarder character for "years".[33][204][205]
Olyphant also worked on numerous films in between seasons ofJustified. He voiced the Spirit of the West in the animated filmRango(2011).[206][207]The character was a parody ofClint Eastwood'sMan with No Name[208]and Olyphant was cast after directorGore Verbinskioverheard him speaking on television: "I just sort of doubled back and looked through the door and was like, "That's our guy" ... Timothy has such a great quality to his voice."[209][210][211]Olyphant appeared as a mentor toAlex Pettyfer's character in the science-fiction thrillerI Am Number Four(2011).[206]Justin Chang ofVarietysaid he "brings some of his usual edge"[212]but Betsy Sharkey of theLos Angeles Timesfelt he was "an untapped resource".[213]Also in 2011, he voiced a character called Sergeant First Class "Grinch" in the video game,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. In 2013, he appeared asJeff Garlin's father in the independent comedyDealin' with Idiots[214][215]and took part in a one-offLACMA Live Readof the black comedyRaising Arizona(1987); he playedNicolas Cage's character whileAmy PoehlerplayedHolly Hunter's character.[216][217]In 2014, Olyphant starred withTina Feyin the ensemble comedy-dramaThis Is Where I Leave You. Their characters were teenage sweethearts until an accident left him with a mild brain injury. The film received mixed reviews,[218]with David Edelstein ofVulturecommenting: "Over the course of his career, Olyphant has given life to head-slappingly bad material, and he does it again by simply underplaying."[219]
Olyphant had a recurring guest role as a fictionalized version of himself in the Fox comedyThe Grinder(2015–2016). His performance received positive critical notices,[220][221][222][223]withUSA Today's Robert Bianco declaring it an "Emmy-deserving performance".[224]The role won him theCritics' Choice Television Award for Best Guest Performer in a Comedy Series.[225]
In early 2016, Olyphant starred in the world premiere ofKenneth Lonergan's comedyHold On to Me Darlingat the off-BroadwayAtlantic Theater Company. His character, Strings McCrane, is a self-absorbed country singer and actor who returns home toTennesseefollowing his mother's death.[226][227]Ben Brantley of theNew York Timesfound him "entertainingly irritating" in a performance that "avoids the obvious route of histrionic posing"; "The startling, bona fide sorrow that Mr. Olyphant brings to [the final scene] truly illuminates everything that has come before."[228]Frank Rizzo ofVarietyfelt his performance was "a stunner, striking just the right notes of guilelessness, obliviousness and narcissism to make Strings one of the most appealing messes in a long time".[229]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterfelt the role "seems tailor-made for his laid-back swagger and sly humor ... Olyphant's natural charm ensures that Strings' unapologetic self-absorption remains more human than monstrous."[230]He also played Henry, ex-husband of Sandy (Jennifer Aniston), in the universally-panned ensembleromantic comedyMother's Day(2016);[231]he  appeared inOliver Stone'sSnowden(2016) as aCIA agentwho befriendswhistleblowerEdward Snowdenjust prior to Snowden's fleeing to Russia, after publicly leaking classified US government information.[232]

Netflix renewed the series for a second season in March 2017[233][234]and for a third, ultimately final season in May 2018.[235]Dark Was the Night, an independent drama in which he starred withMarisa Tomei, was filmed in 2015 and premiered at the 2018Galway Film Fleadh.[236]
