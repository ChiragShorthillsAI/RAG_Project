Secret Serviceagent Mike Banning undergoes training at a military facility inVirginia, owned by his formerArmy Rangercommanding officerWade Jennings, now CEO ofprivate military companySalient Global. Banning is recommended for the position ofSecret Service directorbyU.S. presidentAllan Trumbull, to replace retiring director David Gentry, but hides the fact that he suffers frommigrainesandinsomniaand takes painkillers to cope with chronic back pain from previous combat injuries.
While Trumbull is on a private fishing trip at Queen's Lake inWilliamsburg, a swarm of armeddronesattack and kills his protection detail, with only Banning surviving and saving him. Both are incapacitated, but Banning recovers while Trumbull is left in a coma.FBIagent Helen Thompson is presented with falsified evidence implicating Banning in the attack, leading to his arrest. En route to a detention facility, Banning's transport is ambushed but he escapes after killing the attackers and unmasking them asmercenariesfrom Salient Global with whom he partook in a training exercise. Realizing that Jennings has betrayed and framed him, Banning calls his wife Leah from a nearby gas station, letting her know he is alive and determined to expose the real perpetrator. The call alerts Thompson to his location, forcing him to steal a militia man's 18-wheeler truck while pursued by many police officers. Banning escapes after crashing the truck and eventually makes his way to his estranged father, Clay, who's been living off-grid in a cabin in the backwoods ofWhite Hall, West Virginia.
At theWhite House,Vice PresidentMartin Kirby, nowacting president, tells the press that Banning is responsible for the assassination attempt with support from theRussian government. Banning and his father see Salient mercenaries approaching the house, and Clay detonates multiple explosives around the perimeter, killing the would-be attackers as he and Banning escape. They split up; Clay goes to Banning's house and saves Leah and Lynne from a kidnapping attempt by Jenning's mercenaries. Finding the bodies of Jennings' gunmen lined up against Clay's cabin, Thompson deduces that Banning was being set up after all. Trumbull awakens from his coma and Kirby is revealed to be Jennings' secret co-conspirator, planning to retaliate for Trumbull's "attempted assassination" against Russia. Thompson and another agent, Ramirez, confront Jennings on an airfield, but he kills them both.
Banning reaches the hospital and turns himself in. Trumbull orders his release when he realizes that the Salient mercenaries are attempting to kill him and only Banning can keep him alive. Banning leads him to safety with help from Gentry and other loyal agents as Jennings' mercenaries increase the hospital'sICU's oxygen and nitrogen supply to unstable levels, causing an explosion that levels the hospital. Banning hides Trumbull and Gentry as Jennings' men pursue them. In the ensuing gun battle, Jennings and his men kill most of Trumbull's security detail, but Banning thwarts a flanking attempt and forces the mercenaries to retreat after they are delayed long enough to allow U.S. federal law enforcement officers to arrive. Jennings and his remaining men are gathering on the rooftop to escape in a helicopter but Banning destroys it with agrenade launcher. Although Jennings manages to survive the explosion, Banning fatally wounds him in a knife fight.
Banning isexoneratedwhile Trumbull and Gentry arrest Kirby fortreasonand corruption, revealing that Jennings had kept detailed records of Kirby's involvement as an insurance policy, which were uncovered by Thompson. Clay decides to live with Banning and his family. Feeling guilty over his failure to protect Trumbull and concealing his ailments, Banning offers his resignation, but Trumbull forgives him and offers Banning the promotion to Director, which he proudly accepts.

Millennium Media(formerlyNu ImageandMillennium Films) is an American independent film production and financing company that was founded byAvi Lerner, Trevor Short, Danny Dimbort and Danny Lerner in 1992, and is one of Hollywood's[1]longest running independent film companies.[2]Millennium creates, produces, finances, and sells[3]films worldwide. The company producesaction films, most of which are filmed primarily inSouth AfricaandBulgaria(by 2005, it acquiredNu Boyana Film Studios),[4]among other locations.
In the mid-1980s,The Cannon Group, Inc.began expanding its operation into Africa, taking advantage of cheap locations and labor in countries such asZimbabweandSouth Africa.Avi Lerneropened Nu Metro Entertainment, a film production company based inJohannesburgto accommodate production demands in the countries.[5]During this time, Lerner executive produced many films, such asAmerican Ninja 2: The ConfrontationandRiver of Deathfor Cannon as well asHowling IV: The Original NightmareforHarry Alan Towers.
After pressure from anti-apartheid forces, Cannon closed its African operations in 1988,[6]Lerner created a new company, Nu Image, to produce original, low budget films alongside his brother Danny Lerner and otherCannonemployees Trevor Short, Danny Dimbort andBoaz Davidson.[5]
From 1992, Nu Image began producing multiple films a year, mainly in the action genre. Many of its films wentdirect-to-video, however some, such asShark Attackdebuted ontelevision. Many stars, writers and directors fromThe Cannon Group, Inc.appeared in films for Nu Image, includingDavid Bradley,Michael Dudikoff,Sam FirstenbergandBilly Drago. They also built a new generation of action talent such asBryan Genesse[7]andJoe Lara.[8]
However, their efforts to break into the mainstream withmockbusterssuch asFreefallstarringEric Roberts,Jeff FaheyandPamela Gidley, created to capitalise on the success ofSylvester Stallone'sCliffhangerfailed to make much of an impact.Freefallended up goingdirect-to-video.[9]
After the successes ofcreature featuressuch asAnacondaandDeep Blue Seareleased in the late 1990s, Nu Image produced a spate of low budget franchises to capitalise on the trend including;Tobe Hooper'sCrocodile,Shark Attack,Spiders,Killer Rats,OctopusandRaging Sharksand various sequels were produced from 1999 to 2005. While not critically successful, the films were extremely successful on television and home media.
In 1999, Nu Image formed a subsidiary label, Millennium Films, for higher-budget productions. From the mid-2000s, the main Nu Image company gradually began producing fewer films, with Millennium Films releasing more with a greater level of financing than previously.
In 2005, it purchasedNu Boyana Film Studiosin Bulgaria.[10]
In March 2007, Nu Image acquired a controlling 52% stake in independent film and home video companyFirst Look Studios. As a result, Nu Image and Millennium Films were given an additional outlet for home video and theatrical distribution.[11]
One of the first films to be produced by Millennium Films was the remakeThe Wicker ManstarringNicolas Cage.[12]The film was a critical and commercial failure.[13][14]They continued on with a focus onsequelsandremakesof notable properties such asDay of the Dead[15]andRambo.[16]After the commercial success ofRambo,[17][18]Millennium Films entered into a multi-year deal withLionsgateto produce several big-budgeted films, the first of which wasConan the Barbarian.[19]The deal would be extended over the years with successful box-office hits (The Mechanic[20]) andbox office bombs(The Legend of Hercules[21]). Another notable success wasOlympus Has FallenstarringGerard Butler.[22]
In November 2010, First Look filed for bankruptcy. Nu Image formed Millennium Entertainment, LLC to assume the assets of First Look.[23]
Millennium Entertainment was sold in August 2014. The company's library and distribution assets had been sold to a consortium consisting of its current management and Virgo Investment Group. The new owners renamed the companyAlchemyin January 2015, finally cutting ties to its former sister company Millennium Films, which remained under the control ofAvi Lerner.[24]Alchemy filed forChapter 7 Bankruptcyon June 30, 2016.[25]
In 2017, a deal was reached withThe Recon Group, a Chinese investment firm, for them to purchase a majority stake in the Millennium Films subsidiary.[26]The deal was signed and a $20 million downpayment was secured.[27]However, this deal was later announced to be off in August 2017 due to the Chinese government clamping down on overseas business investments.[28]The same year, Millennium Films was merged into Nu Image to form Millennium Media.
In 2017, Millennium faced sexual harassment allegations alleging hostile workplace and rampant sexual harassment and gender disparity.[29]
In 2018, actor Terry Crews testified in front of Congress that he had been threatened by Avi Lerner of Millennium Media not to testify in his sexual assault case.[30]
