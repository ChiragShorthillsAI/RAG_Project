Bombshellis a 2019 Americanbiographicaldrama filmdirected byJay Roachand written byCharles Randolph. The film starsCharlize Theron,Nicole Kidman, andMargot Robbie, and is based on the accounts of the women atFox Newswho set out to expose CEORoger Ailesforsexual harassment.John Lithgow,Kate McKinnon,Connie Britton,Malcolm McDowell, andAllison Janneyappear in supporting roles.
Bombshellwas released in December 13, 2019. The film's box office resultswere seen as disappointing, but it received mostly positive reviews. It garnered praise for its acting as well as its choices of makeup and hair, which won theAcademy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, while earning some criticism of the screenplay and inaccuracies in the plot and character portrayals.
After co-moderating the2016 Republican debate,Megyn Kellyfaces numerous insults fromDonald Trump, who is angry because she asked him about his offensive comments toward women. Under pressure from the network, and after receiving death threats and unwanted paparazzi attention, Kelly eventually reconciles with Trump.
Meanwhile,Gretchen Carlsonis removed as co-anchor of the popularFox & Friendsshow, and is transferred to a less popular show. Inundated by sexist comments on and off the air, including byRoger Ailes, Carlson meets with lawyers, Nancy Smith and Neil Mullin, who explain that Carlson's contract prevents her from suing the network, but she can sue Ailes personally.
On her first day onThe O'Reilly Factor, Kayla Pospisil meets fellow female staffer Jess Carr, and the two have sex. The next day, Ailes begins sexually harassing Pospisil. Pospisil begins to tell Carr about what happened, but Carr interrupts, saying she cannot get involved.
Carlson is later fired, ostensibly for her on-air support of the federalassault weapons ban, and decides to sue Ailes. When the news breaks the next day, Ailes denies the allegations and Kelly admits to her core team Ailes sexually harassed her when she started at Fox. In the following weeks, despite a number of other women voicing their public support against Ailes, Kelly conspicuously refuses to make a comment on Carlson's accusations.
After more women accuse Ailes, Kelly starts to find other women at the network. Kelly visits Pospisil, and the two confide in each other. Kelly advises Pospisil to come forward, and after consulting with Carr, she does. Through her attorneys, Carlson later informs Ailes she has recorded conversations to support her claims, deliberately withholding them from Ailes's lawyers in order to undermine his credibility. Defeated, Ailes is fired by Fox co-creatorRupert Murdoch. Ailes settles Carlson's lawsuit for $20 million and an apology from Fox, but the settlement contains anon-disclosure agreement. Fox eventually pays the victims of sexual harassment $50 million, while paying Ailes and O'Reilly $65 million in severance.

At the time of the announcement, it was confirmed that Bron Studios was staying on and that producers were looking atFocus Features,Participant Media, andAmblin Entertainmentto help finance the film.[9]The following week,Lionsgatebegan negotiating to join the production after Focus Features and Amblin Entertainment passed on the project.[10]By the end of the month, Lionsgate was reported to be closing a deal to distribute the film.[11]In December 2018, it was reported thatTheodore Shapirowould compose the film's score and thatBarry Ackroydwould serve as the film's cinematographer.[12][13]The film was given the working titleFair and Balanced, before being announced asBombshellin August 2019.[14]Kelly later stated that she had no involvement with the film.[15]

Bombshellgrossed $31.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $29.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $61.4 million.[3][4]
In its limited opening weekend the film made $312,100 from four theaters for a per-venue average of $78,025, the fifth best of 2019.[36]The film went wide at 1,480 theaters the following weekend and, despite being projected to gross around $10 million, finished sixth with $5.1 million. The audience was 58% female, with 60% being between 18 and 34 years old.[37]The following weekend the film made $4.7 million (a total of $8.3 million over the five-day Christmas frame), falling to ninth.[38]The film's box office results were seen as a disappointment, withThe Hillsaying that the presence of other projects about Ailes, such as the documentaryDivide and Conquer: The Story of Roger Ailesand the Showtime seriesThe Loudest Voice, had lowered the demand for a film on the subject.[39]Forbesalso noted that audiences likely do not want to "shell out movie theater money and time to watch a film about women being treated terribly by powerful men... especially (generally speaking) women".[40]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 68% based on 348 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Bombshellbenefits from a terrific cast and a worthy subject, but its impact is muffled by a frustrating inability to go deeper than the sensationalistic surface."[41]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on reviews from 46 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[42]Audiences polled byPostTrakgave the film an average 4 out of 5 stars, with 70% saying they would definitely recommend it.[37]
Variety'sOwen Gleibermangave the film a positive review and wrote: "Bombshellis a scalding and powerful movie about what selling, in America, has become. The film is about selling sex, selling a candidate, selling yourself, selling the truth. And about how at Fox News all those things came together."[43]Todd McCarthyofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "The actors throw themselves into their roles with terrific zeal, enlivened by the often blunt dialogue and the issues at stake."[44]Kevin MaherofThe Timesgave the film 4/5 stars, describing it as "a timely satirical takedown that finds black humour and absurdist comedy in the subject of workplace sexual harassment while never losing sight of its devastating repercussions."[45]Ann Hornaday ofThe Washington Postgave the film 3/4 stars, calling it "an absorbing, well-crafted chronicle of the sexual harassment accusations that forced Fox News founding CEO Roger Ailes to resign in disgrace."[46]
Moira Macdonald ofThe Seattle Timesgave the film 2/4 stars, writing that it "went wrong"; much of it due to Charles Randolph's "cutesy screenplay ... which unfolds at a cartoony pace more suitable to a dark comedy."[47]Simran Hans ofThe Observergave the film 2/5 stars, writing: "What happened to these women is appalling; that the film takes such pains to sand down the politics of its central characters to make them more sympathetic undermines its entire thesis. Kelly'sracistattitudes are smoothed over, while Carlson'shomophobiais conveniently erased." Hans went on to argue that the film would have been more complete had it engaged with the "tension" between what Hans claimed were its protagonists' dual roles as perpetuators of sexism themselves, owing to their status as conservative icons as well as women harmed by a deeply sexist organization; and that by presenting the protagonists simply as sympathetic characters the film failed to make sufficient criticism of these women and their role as cogs in an organization which, in her view, espouses rightwing ideology.[48]Linda Holmes ofNPRwrote: "It has a few strong moments, mostly courtesy of Robbie, but it's both underwhelming and overworked, inelegantly structured and missing something fundamental at the core."[49]Joe MorgensternofThe Wall Street Journalsaid that the film was "a movie with a compelling story to tell turns into a blunt-forcepolemicthat can't stop hammering its message home."[50]
In January 2020, Kelly posted a 30-minute video on herYouTubechannel of a roundtable discussion, including her, Huddy, Bakhtiar, Brunt and former Fox News producer Julie Zann and their reactions and opinions after viewing a screening of the film. The panel confirmed many details depicted, including having to do the "spin" to show off their bodies to Ailes in private; Zann tearfully noted that reality was "worse than that" and the filmmakers "let Roger off easy".[51][52][15]Kelly took particular issue with the scene where Robbie's character blames Kelly for not speaking up, calling the scenevictim blamingand noting that the scene was "written by a man"; however, she also noted that the scene belongs in the film as a reminder to herself that she could have done more to help other victims.[51]She also felt the film "took liberties" with her story and specifically denied that she told Murdoch the question she was going to askDonald Trumpin advance of the debate or that Ailes liked the question. "The notion that Roger liked the Donald Trump 'woman' question because it created controversy and a TV moment was not true. Roger did not like the question — at all — and was very angry at me for asking it. At one point [he] actually said to me, 'No more female empowerment stuff!'."[53][51]
At the92nd Academy Awards, it earned three nominations:Best Actress(Theron),Best Supporting Actress(Robbie), andBest Makeup and Hairstyling, winning the latter. The film also received two nominations at the77th Golden Globe Awards(for Theron and Robbie), four at the26th Screen Actors Guild Awards(Theron, Robbie, and Kidman, as well asOutstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture) and three at the73rd British Academy Film Awards(Theron, Robbie, andBest Makeup and Hair).
