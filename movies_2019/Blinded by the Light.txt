Pictures.[11]Blinded by the Lightreceived positive reviews from critics, and also received nominations for Best Film and Best Actor (for Kalra) at the2019 SIFF Awards.
In 1987, Javed Khan and his family –Pakistani migrantparents Malik and Noor and sisters Yasmeen and Shazia – live inLuton, England, during thepremiership of Margaret Thatcher. Javed likes contemporaryrock music, which Malik disapproves of. Javed writes poetry and lyrics for his best friend Matt's band, but Matt criticises Javed's work for being depressing.
Javed feels out of place at his newsixth-form college, where he is one of twoSouth Asianstudents; the other, Roops, is a fan of "The Boss". In Ms Clay's writing class, Javed develops a crush on a student activist named Eliza and becomes interested in writing as a career. Javed talks to Ms Clay after class about his poetry and diaries. During lunch, Roops approaches him and gives him two Bruce Springsteencassette tapes, calling Springsteen "the direct line to all that is true in this shitty world." Javed faces constant racism from his peers and neighbours, and Malik forbids him to socialise, insisting he "follow the Jews" in his college because of their success as a people.
Javed is denied any opportunity to write for the school paper.Vauxhall Motorslays off much of their workforce, including Malik who had worked there for sixteen years. His mother takes on extra sewing work to pay the bills. Frustrated by racism and Malik's inability to understand him, Javed discards his poems on the night of thegreat storm of 1987. After listening to the Springsteen tapes, the lyrics speak to him, and he recovers his poems. At college, Javed excitedly tells Roops that Springsteen knows exactly how he feels. Inspired to continue writing, he shares his poetry with Ms Clay. A neighbour, Mr Evans, recovers one of Javed's poems that decries theNational Frontas 'scum'. As aSecond World Warex-serviceman, Mr Evans sympathizes with Javed's feelings and calls the poem brilliant, but Javed's parents are less appreciative.
Javed submits a piece about Springsteen to the newspaper, which is accepted. Malik is worried about finding the money for Yasmeen's wedding. Javed takes a Saturday job with Matt's father, also a Springsteen fan, on his market stall. Matt's father helps Javed impress Eliza byserenadingher with a Springsteen song. In the process, Javed upsets Matt by seeming to side with his father as he taunts Matt about his poor musical taste and his band.
Javed asks out Eliza and steeling his nerves with Springsteen songs, the two enjoy a night out and kiss. Javed is inspired to write his own poems about Eliza, which she loves. Ms Clay enjoys his poems and article and arranges an unpaid internship for Javed at theHerald. Malik and his wife have to sell her dowry jewellery presumably to cover his lost wages. Malik does not help his wife with the sewing even though he insists Javed and his sisters help. Javed points this out when his dad objects to him taking the unpaid work experience and his dad responds by saying his biggest mistake was moving to Britain.
Javed learns of growing tensions between the Muslim community and the National Front, who have organized a march and hung a pig's head at the localMosque. Eliza invites Javed to dinner with her conservative and racist parents who imply that she is only with him out of rebellion. Javed later mentions this and says he does not care if she is with him for that reason.
At theHerald, Javed gets paid after an article he wrote about racism is chosen for the front page and decides to use the money to buy tickets for a Springsteen concert. On the morning of his sister's wedding, while Javed runs to the shops to buy tickets, his family arrives separately at the venue and National Front members assault Malik. Upset that Javed withheld money from the family and had dishonoured Malik and the wedding, Malik tells Javed to surrender the tickets, but Javed says the tickets are his and they fight. Malik says Javed will go to a university in Luton and Javed states that Luton does not have a university and that he will go to theUniversity of Manchesterinstead. At this, Malik rips up the tickets. Having had enough of his father, Javed pushes and stuns Malik by telling him he does not want to be his son as he wants to be more than that.
At school, Eliza chastises Javed for abandoning his family on his sister's wedding day, and then for using his family as an excuse for no longer seeing her. In class, Ms Clay tells Javed that his Springsteen essay won him attendance to a lecture atMonmouth CollegeinNew Jersey, near where Springsteen grew up. Javed initially declines, knowing his father will not allow him to go, but later changes his mind when he sees racist graffiti on their home. Malik says America is a bad place and tells Javed that if he leaves, he will not be allowed to return.
Javed and Roops enjoy an inspiring trip to the States. Back home, with Javed staying with Roops, Noor tells Malik to reconcile with Javed and reminds him that he left his own family and country at a young age and that she and Malik will ultimately lose Javed should Malik refuse. When Javed is asked to read his essay at a school event, Eliza recruits Javed's family to show up in support. Instead of reading his original essay, Javed talks about being "Blinded by the Light" of Springsteen and his own dreams and being willing to abandon his friends and family along the way. He recognizes his father's struggles and the way his community has shaped him, saying he must "build a bridge to my ambitions, but not a wall between my family and me." Everyone is moved. Javed reconciles with Eliza and thanks her for inviting his family. Malik reconciles with Javed and tells him that he has read Springsteen's lyrics and admires the themes of working hard and respecting one's family. Before going to Manchester, Javed sells his Springsteen memorabilia to reclaim his mother's jewellery. As Javed leaves for university, he and Malik listen to Springsteen together.
Springsteen allowed twelve of his songs to be used in the soundtrack and it features several Springsteen rarities, including the first performance of "The River", from theNo Nukesconcerts atMadison Square Gardenin 1979 and an acoustic rendition of "The Promised Land" that Springsteen performed in 2014 at Washington, D.C.'sNational Mall. The soundtrack also showcases a number of Springsteen's classics such as "Badlands", "Hungry Heart" and a 1975 acoustic recording of "Thunder Road" performed atThe Roxy Theatre.
The soundtrack contains a previously unreleased Springsteen song "I'll Stand by You", which was originally written for inclusion inHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.[12]
Blinded by the Lightgrossed $19.6 million worldwide.[2]
In Canada and the United States, the film was released alongsideWhere'd You Go, Bernadette,47 Meters Down: UncagedandGood Boys, and was projected to gross around $4 million from 2,307 cinemas in its opening weekend.[13]It made $1.4 million on its first day, and went on to debut to $4.5 million, finishing ninth. Rival studios argued that Warner Bros. should have begun with a limited release to build audience interest, and that the film's August date was too close to that ofYesterday, a film that also depicts a youngBritish Asianmale inspired by a classic popular music act.[14]
Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 259 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's consensus reads: "Like a life-affirming rock anthem,Blinded by the Lighthits familiar chords with confidence and flair, building to a conclusion that leaves audiences cheering for an encore."[15]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted averagescore of 71 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[16]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an average 4.5 out of 5 stars.[14]
Johnny Oleksinski ofThe New York Postcalls it "the feel-good movie of the year".[17]Jordan Ruimy ofThe Playlistcalls it "one of the most joyous and exhilarating movies you will see this year".[18]Leah Greenblatt ofEntertainment Weeklycalls it an ode to "the power of music".[19]Anthony Ray Bench ofFilm Threatcalls it "a feel-good movie that tackles a bunch of tough topics, from politics, race, family traditions, social frustrations, and romance" yet "never feels preachy or overly cheesy."[20]Adam Chitwood ofCollidercalls it "a rapturously joyous, heartfelt, and genuinely insightful film not just about The Boss, but about the personal nature and power of music."[21]
Owen Gleiberman ofVarietycalls it "the sort of unguarded drama they used tomakein the '80s — a coming-of-age tale of unabashed earnestness — but it's also a delirious and romanticrock 'n' rollparable" that is "a more incandescent ode to the life force ofpop musicthan any film ever adapted from the work ofNick Hornby."[22]Bedatri Datta Choudhury ofVague Visagessays that, while "Springsteen takes theAmerican dreamand helps everyone navigate through its dismantling," Chadha "makes it speak to an entirely different country and a whole new generation."[23]
At the 2019 SIFF Awards in theSeattle International Film Festival,Blinded by the Lightreceived nominations for Best Film (for director Gurinder Chadha) and Best Actor (for Viveik Kalra).[24]In July 2019, Ethan Anderson of/FilmlistedBlinded by the Lightas the eighth best film of 2019 so far.[25]A critics' survey byIndieWirelistedBlinded by the Lightas one of the eight best films of Summer 2019.[26]

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]
Warner Bros. owns some shared universes. Some of them are based on books and comics, including some of the highest grossing IP's in the movie industry.

Gurinder Kaur Chadha,OBE(born 10 January 1960)[1]is aKenyan-born British film director ofIndianorigin. Most of her films explore the lives of Indians living in England. The common theme in her work showcases the trials of Indian women residing in the UK and how they must reconcile their converging traditional and modern cultures. Many of her films address social and emotional issues, especially ones faced by immigrants caught between two worlds.
Much of her work also consists of adaptations from book to film, but with a different flair. She is best known for the filmsBhaji on the Beach(1993),Bend It Like Beckham(2002),Bride and Prejudice(2004),Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging(2008),It's a Wonderful Afterlife(2010) andViceroy's House(2017). Her latest features are the biographical musical comedy-dramaBlinded by the Light(2019) and the television showBeecham House.
Gurinder Chadha was born inNairobi,Kenya, then a British colony. Her Punjabi Sikh Khatri  family was part of theIndian diaspora in East Africa.[2]Bhajan, her father (who died in 1999), and her mother were both born in Kenya, and remained there until the political turbulence leading up to independence prompted the family to relocate. Her family held "united citizenship" under theBritish Nationality Act 1948which granted them rights of entry and settlement in Britain. Her father moved first and was joined by the family the following year[3]moving toSouthall, West London, when she was two years of age, where she attended Clifton Primary School.[4]Chadha's father faced prejudice because of his appearance as a Sikh Indian, wearing a turban and having a beard. Her father had worked as a clerical officer in Barclays Bank in Kenya but was unable to secure the same position due to his appearance.[3]Eventually, the family opened a shop to support the family.[5]
Many of her future films would draw on her personal experience of being Indian and English at the same time, and how she dealt with the duality of her identity. Upon completion of her documentary,I'm British but...Chadha insisted the premiere be held at the Southall Community Center to honour her home community.[3]She would not wear traditional Indian clothing, and refused to cook for her family. In her mind, having all the women in the kitchen cooking while the men sat and ate was oppressive, although it is a living part of Indian culture. Therefore, she sat at the table with the men and was "extremely outspoken."[6]After graduating from theUniversity of East Angliawhere she studied politics and developmental economics before radio journalism, Chadha attended theLondon College of Printingin 1984/85 and studied as a post-graduate. When she decided she wanted to go to the University of East Anglia to do development studies, her teachers suggested a secretarial course, or a lesser university.[7]
After beginning her media career in radio in the mid-1980s, Chadha became aBBCtelevision news reporter. She directed award-winning documentaries for theBritish Film Institute, BBC andChannel Four, and in 1989 released the documentaryI'm British but...forChannel 4, which followed the lives of youngBritish Asians. In 1990, Chadha established aproduction company, Umbi Films having no formal film training. Her first film was the 11-minuteNice Arrangement(1991) about a British Asian wedding. It was selected for the Cannes Film Festival Critic's section in 1991.[8]
Chadha mentions the influence that the filmPurab aur Pachhimhad on her work, in an interview withRobert K. ElderforThe Film That Changed My Life.[9]
There's a wonderful kind of yearning quality about what is culture and the perils of living in the West and the dangers of what could happen.[10]
Her affinity for stories about families was also attributed to her love forIt's a Wonderful Life.
She was empowered by BritishBhangra musicwhich combines Punjabi folk rhythms, electronic instrumentation, Bombay film styles, and Western disco;I'm British, but...uses this type of music as a metaphor for syncretic nature of British Asian identity.[3]
Her documentaryActing our Age (1992), set out to understand what it was like being Asian and elderly in Britain. During production she gave film crew to the elderly participants and allowed them to create their own film in order to challenge perception and layer spectator images.[3]
Her first feature,Bhaji on the Beach(1994), won numerous international awards including aBAFTANomination for 'Best British Film of 1994' and theEvening Standard British Film Awardfor 'Best Newcomer to British Cinema'. Chadha first received wide recognition for the film in 1993. It was the first full-length feature film made by a British Asian woman.[8]The film concerns a day in the lives of Indian women, across different generations, and how they change in order to converge their cultural background with modern UK living. Chadha utilizes subtlety and nuances in dialogue and fashion in order to relay the fact that these women come from a very specific culture. For example, one character wears a leather jacket over her Indian garb, showing how she is fusing her two cultures.Prejudicecomes from both outside and inside the British-Indian community; white men treat the immigrants as garbage, while the older generation of Indian women judge the modern woman is challenged by the progressive views of the younger women, as they try to break free from the "oppression" that Chadha fought hard to break free from herself.[11]Her 1994 interview withAli Kazimiin Rungh Magazine focusses on many of the main themes in Bhaji on the Beach.[12]
Issues of domestic abuse and male superiority are also showcased in the film, as one character and her young son are chased by her abusive husband and his family. Another character, who is expected to be a doctor by her parents and the local Indian community, becomes pregnant by a black classmate, which is a taboo in the community. The film was low budget, but received critical success for its take on racial stereotypes, immigration, and gender roles. Several major projects followed includingBend It Like Beckham(2002) andBride and Prejudice(2004).
In 1995, she directedRich Deceiver, a two-part drama for the BBC, watched by 11 million viewers.
Her award-winning films have earned over $300 million at the international box office.[13]
What's Cooking?was the Opening Night Film of the 2000Sundance Film Festival, and was the first British script to be invited to the Sundance Institute's Writer's Lab.[14]The film was voted joint audience award winner in the New York Film Critics' 2000 season (tied withBilly Elliot), and Chadha won the award for Best British Director in the London Film Critics' Circle Awards.
Bend it Like Beckhamwas the highest grossing British-financed, British-distributed film, ever in the UK box-office (prior to the success ofSlumdog Millionaire). The film was a critical and commercial success internationally, topping the box-office charts in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and South Africa, and winning audience favourite film awards at theLocarno,SydneyandTorontofilm festivals. The film received aGolden Globe Nomination for Best Picture (Musical or Comedy), aBAFTA Nomination for Best British Film, aEuropean Film Academy Nomination for Best Film, and aWriters Guild of America Nomination for Best Original Screenplay. LikeBhaji on the Beach,Bend it Like Beckhamfeatures a strong Indian-British woman, Jess, who tries to realize her dreams while maneuvering through her duties as a daughter of traditional Indian parents. Although marketed to the United States as a "chick flick", it is regarded in Britain as an important post-feminist film that fits perfectly into the British progressive frame of 2002. Prime Minister Blair even wrote a congratulatory letter to Chadha, saying, "We loved it, loved it, because this is my Britain." Chadha herself meant for the film to be a "girl power" movie, which features both a white woman and an Indian-British woman fighting for their shared dream of playing professional soccer. It addressed issues of prejudice against race and sexuality, however, allowing the film to transcend the "chick flick" moniker.[15]Topics of interracial coupling and lesbian stereotyping add meaning to the "girl power movie." In 2015, Chada mounted the stage musical version ofBend it Like Beckhamin London's West End to 5-Star Reviews & critics' awards.[13]
Bride and Prejudice, a film which marriesJane Austenwith Indian and Western musicals, was the first film ever to open at Number One in the UK and India on the same day. It attempted to fuse Bollywood, Hollywood, and a "British sensibility" into one film. For each character and scene of the original novel, Chadha adds an Indian twist. For example, the original diversity of class between the two leads in the original book are changed into a diversity of race, having the female lead as an Indian and the male lead a white man. The film was not meant to be an actual Bollywood movie, however. Much of the film is Westernized for a Western audience. There are both Bollywood numbers and Western musical numbers inspired by the likes of "Grease" and "West Side Story".[16]
She wrote the screenplay forThe Mistress of Spices(2005), based uponthe novel of the same namebyChitra Banerjee Divakaruni, with Berges, who directed the film.
In 2005, Chadha appeared on the BBC showYour London, in which she told the story of aSikhprince who lived inLondonin the 19th century. In 2006, she took part in the BBC genealogy seriesWho Do You Think You Are?in which she traced her Sikh family roots back to Kenya and before that to India'sPunjab.
Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging– based on theinternational bestseller, was released worldwide byParamount Picturesin 2008/2009.It's a Wonderful Afterlifepremiered at the Sundance Film Festival before releasing internationally in 2010.
Chadha has received several Honorary Doctorates from British universities and was awarded an O.B.E. in the 2006Queen's Birthday HonoursList on 17 June 2006 for her services to the British film industry.

With regard to her religious beliefs, Chadha told theBBCin an October 2014 interview:
For most of my life I've been saying no to that question. But, call it age or whatever, I do believe in something now. I don't think it's a white man with a big beard, but I do think that there are forces around us that we don't necessarily understand. I do believe in fate. That's a very Indian thing, but I do believe that everything happens for a reason and what goes around comes around. I suppose what I'm saying is that I believe in karma. If you're a good person and you do good things and don't think negative thoughts about other people, you actually lead a much better life.[32]

In 1987, Javed Khan and his family –Pakistani migrantparents Malik and Noor and sisters Yasmeen and Shazia – live inLuton, England, during thepremiership of Margaret Thatcher. Javed likes contemporaryrock music, which Malik disapproves of. Javed writes poetry and lyrics for his best friend Matt's band, but Matt criticises Javed's work for being depressing.
Javed feels out of place at his newsixth-form college, where he is one of twoSouth Asianstudents; the other, Roops, is a fan of "The Boss". In Ms Clay's writing class, Javed develops a crush on a student activist named Eliza and becomes interested in writing as a career. Javed talks to Ms Clay after class about his poetry and diaries. During lunch, Roops approaches him and gives him two Bruce Springsteencassette tapes, calling Springsteen "the direct line to all that is true in this shitty world." Javed faces constant racism from his peers and neighbours, and Malik forbids him to socialise, insisting he "follow the Jews" in his college because of their success as a people.
Javed is denied any opportunity to write for the school paper.Vauxhall Motorslays off much of their workforce, including Malik who had worked there for sixteen years. His mother takes on extra sewing work to pay the bills. Frustrated by racism and Malik's inability to understand him, Javed discards his poems on the night of thegreat storm of 1987. After listening to the Springsteen tapes, the lyrics speak to him, and he recovers his poems. At college, Javed excitedly tells Roops that Springsteen knows exactly how he feels. Inspired to continue writing, he shares his poetry with Ms Clay. A neighbour, Mr Evans, recovers one of Javed's poems that decries theNational Frontas 'scum'. As aSecond World Warex-serviceman, Mr Evans sympathizes with Javed's feelings and calls the poem brilliant, but Javed's parents are less appreciative.
Javed submits a piece about Springsteen to the newspaper, which is accepted. Malik is worried about finding the money for Yasmeen's wedding. Javed takes a Saturday job with Matt's father, also a Springsteen fan, on his market stall. Matt's father helps Javed impress Eliza byserenadingher with a Springsteen song. In the process, Javed upsets Matt by seeming to side with his father as he taunts Matt about his poor musical taste and his band.
Javed asks out Eliza and steeling his nerves with Springsteen songs, the two enjoy a night out and kiss. Javed is inspired to write his own poems about Eliza, which she loves. Ms Clay enjoys his poems and article and arranges an unpaid internship for Javed at theHerald. Malik and his wife have to sell her dowry jewellery presumably to cover his lost wages. Malik does not help his wife with the sewing even though he insists Javed and his sisters help. Javed points this out when his dad objects to him taking the unpaid work experience and his dad responds by saying his biggest mistake was moving to Britain.
Javed learns of growing tensions between the Muslim community and the National Front, who have organized a march and hung a pig's head at the localMosque. Eliza invites Javed to dinner with her conservative and racist parents who imply that she is only with him out of rebellion. Javed later mentions this and says he does not care if she is with him for that reason.
At theHerald, Javed gets paid after an article he wrote about racism is chosen for the front page and decides to use the money to buy tickets for a Springsteen concert. On the morning of his sister's wedding, while Javed runs to the shops to buy tickets, his family arrives separately at the venue and National Front members assault Malik. Upset that Javed withheld money from the family and had dishonoured Malik and the wedding, Malik tells Javed to surrender the tickets, but Javed says the tickets are his and they fight. Malik says Javed will go to a university in Luton and Javed states that Luton does not have a university and that he will go to theUniversity of Manchesterinstead. At this, Malik rips up the tickets. Having had enough of his father, Javed pushes and stuns Malik by telling him he does not want to be his son as he wants to be more than that.
At school, Eliza chastises Javed for abandoning his family on his sister's wedding day, and then for using his family as an excuse for no longer seeing her. In class, Ms Clay tells Javed that his Springsteen essay won him attendance to a lecture atMonmouth CollegeinNew Jersey, near where Springsteen grew up. Javed initially declines, knowing his father will not allow him to go, but later changes his mind when he sees racist graffiti on their home. Malik says America is a bad place and tells Javed that if he leaves, he will not be allowed to return.
Javed and Roops enjoy an inspiring trip to the States. Back home, with Javed staying with Roops, Noor tells Malik to reconcile with Javed and reminds him that he left his own family and country at a young age and that she and Malik will ultimately lose Javed should Malik refuse. When Javed is asked to read his essay at a school event, Eliza recruits Javed's family to show up in support. Instead of reading his original essay, Javed talks about being "Blinded by the Light" of Springsteen and his own dreams and being willing to abandon his friends and family along the way. He recognizes his father's struggles and the way his community has shaped him, saying he must "build a bridge to my ambitions, but not a wall between my family and me." Everyone is moved. Javed reconciles with Eliza and thanks her for inviting his family. Malik reconciles with Javed and tells him that he has read Springsteen's lyrics and admires the themes of working hard and respecting one's family. Before going to Manchester, Javed sells his Springsteen memorabilia to reclaim his mother's jewellery. As Javed leaves for university, he and Malik listen to Springsteen together.
Springsteen allowed twelve of his songs to be used in the soundtrack and it features several Springsteen rarities, including the first performance of "The River", from theNo Nukesconcerts atMadison Square Gardenin 1979 and an acoustic rendition of "The Promised Land" that Springsteen performed in 2014 at Washington, D.C.'sNational Mall. The soundtrack also showcases a number of Springsteen's classics such as "Badlands", "Hungry Heart" and a 1975 acoustic recording of "Thunder Road" performed atThe Roxy Theatre.
The soundtrack contains a previously unreleased Springsteen song "I'll Stand by You", which was originally written for inclusion inHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.[12]

Owen Gleiberman ofVarietycalls it "the sort of unguarded drama they used tomakein the '80s — a coming-of-age tale of unabashed earnestness — but it's also a delirious and romanticrock 'n' rollparable" that is "a more incandescent ode to the life force ofpop musicthan any film ever adapted from the work ofNick Hornby."[22]Bedatri Datta Choudhury ofVague Visagessays that, while "Springsteen takes theAmerican dreamand helps everyone navigate through its dismantling," Chadha "makes it speak to an entirely different country and a whole new generation."[23]
