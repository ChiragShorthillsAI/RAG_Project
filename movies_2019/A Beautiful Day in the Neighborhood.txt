A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhoodis a 2019 Americanbiographicaldrama filmon the TV presenterFred Rogers, directed byMarielle Hellerand written byMicah Fitzerman-BlueandNoah Harpster, inspired by the 1998 article "Can You Say... Hero?" byTom Junod, published inEsquire. It starsTom Hanks,Matthew Rhys,Susan Kelechi Watson, andChris Cooper. It depicts Lloyd Vogel (Rhys), a troubled journalist forEsquirewho is assigned to profile television icon Fred Rogers (Hanks).
The film premiered at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 7, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 22, 2019, bySony Pictures Releasing. It grossed $68 million worldwide. Critics praised Hanks and Rhys's performances, Heller's direction, and its heart-warming messages. It was chosen byTimemagazineas one of the ten best films of the year.[4]For his performance, Hanks was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at theAcademy Awards, as well as theGolden Globes,Critics' Choice,Screen Actors Guild Awards, andBAFTA Awards, among others.
Esquiremagazinejournalist Lloyd Vogel is known for his cynical writing. Lloyd is reluctant to attend his sister Lorraine's third wedding because his estranged father Jerry will be there. However, he attends with his wife, Andrea, and their newborn son, Gavin. When Jerry makes an inappropriate remark about Lloyd's deceased mother Lila—whom he cheated on and abandoned when she was dying of cancer twenty years earlier—Lloyd becomes enraged and punches his father, starting a chaotic brawl.
When Lloyd's editor, Ellen, assigns him to interview Fred Rogers for a 400-word article about heroes, Lloyd feels the assignment is beneath him. However, he is informed that none of the other heroes on the list were willing to be interviewed. AtWQEDstudio in Pittsburgh, Rogers is dismissive of his own fame and shows concern for Lloyd's nose injury. With coaxing, Lloyd relates some issues he has with his father, including his father's apology and attempt at reconciliation, which Lloyd has rebuffed. Rogers tells Lloyd how he deals with anger, including striking the keys of a piano.
Lloyd believes that Fred Rogers' friendly persona is an act and is determined to expose it. Lloyd watches several episodes of Rogers' show but cannot find anything to support his theory. When Rogers visits New York, Lloyd interviews him again. Rogers seems to dodge Lloyd's questions and instead reminisces about raising his two sons. When Rogers asks about Lloyd's childhood stuffed rabbit and his father, Lloyd abruptly ends the interview. Meanwhile, Jerry and his wife Dorothy arrive at Lloyd's house while he is talking with Andrea. Jerry and Lloyd have a tense conversation about Jerry's absence during Lila's cancer progression and his self-development since then. As Lloyd relates how his mother suffered in her last moments with only him and his sister present, Jerry suffers a heart attack and is transported to the hospital.  Lloyd decides to seek counsel from Rogers, ostensibly to work on a project for Andrea, though she objects him to him traveling to Pittsburgh. Lloyd is exhausted upon arriving at the hospital. He envisions himself as Mr. Rogers' guest and that Mr. Rogers is asking him about hospitals and Lloyd replies that he is exhausted. In a surreal dream, Lloyd Vogel is wearing rabbit ears and has shrunk to the size of Daniel Striped Tiger and King Friday XIII. Rogers and Andrea (as Lady Aberlin) tower over him. In another dream, Lloyd encounters Lila, who recognizes his anger at forgetting her. She assures him that she does not need him to remember her.
After Lloyd is injured in a fight with Jerry, Rogers and his wife, Joanne, take Lloyd to their home to recuperate. While there, Rogers encourages Lloyd to think about the people who loved him and to forgive Jerry. Rogers also tells Lloyd that he is not alone and that he is loved. Lloyd visits Jerry and Dorothy at their home, where he learns that Jerry is dying of cardiac stenosis. Lloyd realizes that Jerry's attempt to reconnect was because he knew he was dying. Lloyd forgives Jerry, promising to be a better father, and writes an article about Rogers' impact on his life. Dorothy believes that Jerry's illness may have contributed to his decision to reconnect with his family. Lorraine and her husband Todd visit Jerry with their friend Rogers. Before Rogers leaves, he asks Jerry to pray with him. Shortly after the visit, Jerry dies. Lloyd's 10,000-word article, "Can You Say... Hero?" is published asEsquire's cover story. The film ends with Mr. Rogers filming the post-show routine of his program, briefly flubbing a take. After production wraps for the day, Mr. Rogers begins playing the piano afterwards, stopping to strike keys in frustration, before playing again peacefully.

Steve Pond ofTheWrapwrote: "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhoodfinds a gentle state of grace and shows the courage and smarts to stay in that zone, never rushing things or playing for drama... But just as Mr. Rogers used his show to talk about big issues with children in a tone that was softer and more halting than you'd expect given the subject matter, so does Heller stick to understatement in a way that threatens to become dull or sappy but never does."[39]Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardianwrote: "It's a given that Hanks will nab at least a best supporting actor nomination but it would be all too easy to forget his co-star. The cynic-becomes-a-believer arc is age old but it unfolds here without cliche thanks to an emotionally intelligent script from Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue, but mainly because of a marvelous, prickly turn from Rhys."[40]
Armond Whiteof theNational Reviewwas more critical: "Heller and screenwriters Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster don't show enough faith in Rogers' remedies—and not enough interest in their religious origins. In short, the movie seems wary of faith (it briefly mentions that Rogers was an ordained minister) and settles for secular sentimentality to account for his sensibility and behavior. This not only weakens the film, but it also hobbles Hanks's characterization."[41]

TriStar Pictures, Inc.(spelled asTri-Staruntil 1991) is an Americanfilm studioandproduction companythat is a member of theSony Pictures Motion Picture Group,[1]part of the multinational conglomerateSony Group Corporation. It is a corporate sibling of fellow Sony studio,Columbia Pictures.
TriStar Pictures was established on March 2, 1982, founded by Victor Kaufman as Nova Pictures, changed a year later to Tri-Star to avoid confusion with thePBSseriesNova.[3]Its most notable releases includeTerminator 2: Judgment Day,Basic Instinct,Rambo: First Blood Part IIand Hollywood’s first everGodzilla.
Originally a joint venture between Columbia Pictures,CBS, andHBO, whose individual video units handled video, broadcast, and pay cable rights to its products,[4]the company scored a number of box-office hits with modestly budgeted fare in the 1980s, as well as fortuitous distribution deals with theProducers Sales Organization,[5]Carolco Pictures[6]and theTaft Entertainment Group.[7]It also expanded ambitiously throughout the decade with the acquisition ofLoews Theatresand the formation ofits own television arm. Among the various hits TriStar scored on its own during the decade wereAbout Last Night,The Muppets Take Manhattan,Real Genius,Nothing in Common,Peggy Sue Got Married,The Principal,Look Who's TalkingandSteel Magnolias.
On November 15, 1985, CBS dropped out of the joint venture, selling its stake to Columbia Pictures.[8]HBO sold its shares to the same studio in 1986 in order to formHBO Pictures.[9]On December 21, 1987, Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. followingThe Coca-Cola Company's merger of Tri-Star and Columbia to become "Columbia/Tri-Star", of which it owned 80% of its stock.[10]In January 1988, CPE's stocks somewhat fell, and Coca-Cola decreased its shares in CPE to 49%. On April 13, 1988, the name of the company reverted to Tri-Star Pictures, Inc.[11]On November 8, 1989, theSony Corporation of Japanacquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment for $3.4 billion. On August 7, 1991, under Sony Pictures Entertainment, the hyphen was officially removed from the name of the studio. TriStar became the first new Americanmajor film studiosinceRKO Pictures, which was founded in 1928.
During the 1990s, TriStar operated autonomously from Columbia. Although its products were mostly indistinguishable from that of its sister studio, it soon scored a string of hits at the box office with such films asSleepless in Seattle,Philadelphia,The Mirror Has Two Faces,Jerry Maguire,As Good as It Gets,BugsyandJumanji, and it also scored a major video hit withDanny DeVito'sMatilda.[12]However, in 1998, the company fell on hard times following the box-office disappointment of its remake of theJapanesemonster filmGodzilla, and Sony quickly responded by merging the studio with Columbia to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Pictures Group.[13]The TriStar name was subsequently used by Sony on a very limited basis until 2004, when the company decided to turn the studio into a genre label that specialized in acquisitions.[14]In 2015, Sony formedTriStar Productionsas a vehicle for film and television productions.[15]TriStar Pictures is currently being used as a vehicle for distribution of products from that new entity and other items from Sony Pictures, including titles fromSony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions.[16]
TriStar Pictures is a member of theMotion Picture Association(MPA).[17]
The concept for Tri-Star Pictures can be traced to Victor Kaufman, a senior executive ofColumbia Pictures(then a subsidiary ofthe Coca-Cola Company),[18]who convinced Columbia,HBO, andCBSto share resources and split the ever-growing costs of making movies, leading to the creation of a new joint venture on March 2, 1982. On May 16, 1983, it was given the name Tri-Star Pictures (when the new company was formed and did not have an official name, the press used the code-name "Nova", but the name could not be obtained as it was being used as the title for thePBSscience series).[3][19]Tri-Star embarked on a 12 to 18 feature film slate per year, with a combined budget of $70 to $80 million and signed producer Walter Colbenz as vice president of the Tri-Star feature film studio, and signed initial development deals with directorJohn Schlesingerand producers Jeffrey Walker and Michael Walker.[20]Tri-Star's first project to roll out wasThe Muppets Take Manhattan.[21]
On May 11, 1984, Tri-Star's first produced film was released,The NaturalstarringRobert Redford. Tri-Star's first release, however, was the film,Where the Boys Are '84; a 1984remakeof the 1960Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) picture,Where the Boys Arethat was co-distributed on behalf ofITC EntertainmentafterUniversalrejected it; the film was a commercial flop.[22]
Many of Tri-Star's productions were released on VHS byRCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video,HBO/Cannon Video, orCBS/Fox Video. In addition, HBO owned exclusive cable distribution rights to the films, with broadcast television licenses going to CBS.[4]
On May 8, 1984, Tri-Star Pictures secured North American distribution rights for the filmSupergirlfromWarner Bros., which enabled the film to be ready for distribution by Christmas 1984.[23]On May 15, 1984, the studio hit big through its association withCarolco Pictures, with the release ofRambo: First Blood Part II, which eventually became a smash hit for the studio the following year.[6][24]The company also partnered withProducers Sales Organizationto handle theatrical distribution of the PSO titles,[5]while both Tri-Star and Columbia struck a deal for film financing with Delphi Film Associates.[25]
CBS dropped out of the Tri-Star venture in November 1985.[8]HBO also dropped out of the venture and sold half of its shares to Columbia Pictures following a month.[9][26]Despite the changes in majority ownership, Tri-Star continued ambition-laden expansion plans. Chief among these plans was an expansion of their successful relationship with Carolco; a new extension of their pre-existing deal included Tri-Star gaining theatrical distribution rights to various Carolco projects, includingRambo IIIandAir America;Carolco retained all foreign, cable, television and videocassette rights.[27]Taft/Barish Productions, a joint venture ofTaft BroadcastingandKeith Barish Productions, signed a $200 million domestic distribution deal with Tri-Star (much like Carolco, Taft/Barish retained non-theatrical and ancillary distribution rights). Of the four films to emerge from this pact, onlyThe Running Manwould become a major success.[7]
Another avenue of expansion was acquiring the storiedLoews Theaterschain of cineplexes in October 1986 for $300 million, after a deal to purchaseUnited Artists TheatersfromTele-Communications, Inc.did not come to fruition. At the time, Loews had 260 theaters in six states.[28][29][30]
1987 was another ambitious year for Tri-Star; plans were in place to take Tri-Star from a relatively new, untested film company into a major film studio. Components of these plans included the formation ofTriStar Television, and joining forces withStephen J. CannellProductions andWitt/Thomas/HarrisProductions to create a television distribution company known as TeleVentures; they also proposed forming their own home video label, Tri-Star Video, taking over from the trio of distributors (RCA/Columbia, CBS/Fox and HBO/Cannon).[31][32]A full-on international distribution arm was also in the planning stages.[33]Another distribution deal was signed by Tri-Star andHemdale Film Corporationin September 1987, but only one film,High Tide, would result from that deal.[34]
However, Tri-Star's ambitions were curtailed by yet more change in ownership.The Coca-Cola Companyboosted its stake in Tri-Star to 29.3% that September.[35]That December, following several high-profile flops (includingIshtar), Coca-Cola began a plan to get out of the media industry; Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc., and Coca-Cola sold its entertainment business to Tri-Star for $3.1 billion. Coca-Cola would then gradually reduce their holdings in the new company to 49%. Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names; a new Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. entity was created in April 1988.[10][11]
As a result, Tri-Star's television division was consolidated into a single operating entity withColumbia/EmbassyTelevision and Coca-Cola Television to form a new incarnation ofColumbia Pictures Television.Merv Griffin Enterpriseswould continue to operate separately.[36][37]Similarly, Tri-Star's nascent video division was absorbed into RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video.[38]
In 1989, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. was acquired by Japanese conglomerateSony Corporation, which merged Columbia and Tri-Star, but continued to use the separate labels. On July 11, 1990, Tri-Star Pictures dissolved and sold its venture in TeleVentures to Stephen J. Cannell Productions and TeleVentures became Cannell Distribution Co. Most of the series and the Tri-Star film packages that were distributed by TeleVentures were transferred to Columbia Pictures Television Distribution.[39]Sony Pictures Entertainment later revived TriStar Television as a television production banner in 1991 (by way of acquiring rights to shows fromNew World Television) and merged with its sister television studioColumbia Pictures Television(CPT) to formColumbia TriStar Television(CTT) on February 21, 1994.[40][41]Both studios continued to operate separately under the CTT umbrella until TriStar Television folded in 1999 and CPT folded in 2001.
In addition to its own slate, TriStar Pictures was the theatrical distributor for many films produced byCarolco Pictures(the rights to only one of its films,Cliffhanger, has been retained by TriStar). TriStar Pictures also theatrically distributed someFilmDistrictfilms. In 1992, TriStar Pictures, along withJapan Satellite Broadcastingsigned an agreement withThe IndieProd Companyto distribute movies produced by IndieProd in order to fill the void left by Carolco, whose deal with TriStar Pictures was on the verge of expiring amid financial troubles.[42]
Around summer 1998, SPE merged Columbia and TriStar to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group, but just like Columbia Pictures Entertainment, both divisions continued producing and distributing films under their own names. Some of the movies slated to be released by TriStar Pictures, includingStepmomwould go to Sony's flagship labelColumbia Picturesfollowing the merger.[13]
TriStar was relaunched on May 13, 2004, as a marketing and acquisitions unit that had a "particular emphasis on genre films".[14]Screen Gems' executive vice president Valerie Van Galder was tapped to run the revived studio after being dormant.[43]However, the release of its 2013 filmElysiumrepresented the label's first big-budget release sinceThe Mask of Zorroin 1998.
The same year, former20th Century Foxco-chairmanTom Rothmanjoined Sony Pictures and createdTriStar Productionsas a joint venture with existing Sony Pictures executives. The new TriStar would develop, finance and produce up to four films per year, as well as television programming and acquisitions, starting on September 1.[15][44][45]Sony's TriStarPicturesunit is currently being retained for "other product, including titles fromSony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions", and is distributing product from TriStar Productions.[16]
TriStar's logo features the winged horsePegasus(either stationary or flying across the screen). The idea came from executive Victor Kaufman and his family's interest in riding horses. The original logo was created with the assistance ofSydney Pollack, who was an adviser at Tri-Star. The horse in the original filmed logo was the same one used in Pollack's filmThe Electric Horseman.[46]
