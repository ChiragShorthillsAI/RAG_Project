The film starsEd Skrein,Patrick Wilson,Luke Evans,Aaron Eckhart,Nick Jonas,Mandy Moore,Dennis Quaid,Tadanobu Asano,Darren Criss, andWoody Harrelson.
The film was a passion project of Emmerich's, and he had trouble getting financial support for the film before finally raising sufficient funds and officially announcing the project in 2017. Much of the cast joined in 2018, and filming began in Hawaii. Some filming also took place inMontreal. With a production budget of $100million, it is to date one of the most expensiveindependent filmsof all time.
Midwaywas theatrically released byLionsgateandSummit Entertainmentin the United States on November8, 2019 and received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised the visuals but criticized the screenplay. The film was abox-office bomb, grossing only $126 million worldwide against the $100 million budget.[5]
In December 1937, Lieutenant CommanderEdwin T. Layton, an American naval attaché intelligence officer, is warned during a state function in Tokyo between theUnited States Navy,Royal Navy, andImperial Japanese Navyby AdmiralIsoroku Yamamotothat, because 80% of Japan's oil is imported, if the US were to threaten their oil supply then the Japanese would have no choice but to wage war.
On December 7, 1941, duringWorld War II, following the US's decision to cut off Japan's oil supply, the Japanese launch asurprise attack on Pearl Harbor, forcing the US to enter the war. Admiral Yamamoto, with the support of Rear AdmiralTamon Yamaguchi, proposes an audacious plan to invadeMidway Islandusing the four available Japanese carriers of the "Kido Butai" but the Japanese Army overrules them. In February, naval aviator LieutenantRichard "Dick" Bestand the Air Group of the carrierUSSEnterpriselaunches raids against theMarshall Islands. In April, after Lieutenant ColonelJimmy Doolittle'sraid on Tokyo, Yamamoto, Yamaguchi, and Vice AdmiralChuichi Nagumoare permitted to carry out their plan to attack Midway.
In May, following theBattle of the Coral Sea, Layton, along withJoseph Rochefortand his cryptography team, usesignals intelligenceto intercept Japanese messages about an operation against an objective identified only as "AF". Layton and his team believe that "AF" is Midway Atoll, while Washington believes it to be a target in the South Pacific. The newly appointed commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, AdmiralChester W. Nimitz, remains skeptical. To prove their theory, Layton instructs Midway to send an unencrypted message stating they are suffering from a water shortage. The Japanese pick up this signal and send an intercepted message about water shortages on "AF," confirming "AF" to be Midway. Hoping to mount his surprise attack, Nimitz orders theaircraft carriersUSSHornetandEnterpriseto be recalled from the Coral Sea and demands that the damagedUSSYorktownbe repaired in 72 hours for combat operations. AdmiralWilliam Halsey Jris placed on shore leave due toshinglesand is temporarily replaced by AdmiralRaymond A. Spruance.
On June 4, the Japanese launch an air raid on Midway. Initial attempts by US land-based aircraft to strike the Japanese fleet carriers fail, although Nagumo is shaken when a crashing American bomber narrowly misses the bridge of theJapanese aircraft carrierAkagiin an apparent ramming attempt. The submarineUSSNautilustries to attack the fleet and is chased off by theJapanese destroyerArashi. American squadrons attack the Japanese fleet without success, and a surviving crew memberGeorge H. Gay Jr.in the water as the persistent attacks disrupt the fleet from launching their counterstrike. Upon spotting theArashifrom the air,Wade McCluskycorrectly figures out the destroyer is rushing back to the fleet and leads his planes to follow its course. Arriving to find the JapaneseCombat Air Patrolat low level due to the previous attacks, the dive bombers reduce the Japanese aircraft carriersKaga,SōryūandAkagito burning wrecks. Nagumo is persuaded to transfer his flag while Yamaguchi, aboard the sole remaining carrier,Hiryu, launches a strike that succeeds in cripplingYorktownbutEnterpriseandHornetsuccessfully cripple theHiryuin response. Admiral Yamaguchi chooses togo down with his commandalong with the Captain, asHiryuisscuttled.
Yamamoto orders a general withdrawal. At Pearl Harbor, Rochefort intercepts the Japanese order to withdraw and passes it to Layton, who informs Nimitz. Best is discharged from the Navy for his lung problems, incurred due to the use of faulty breathing apparatus during the battle and returns home to his wife and daughter.
On May 23, 2017, it was reported thatRoland Emmerichwould be directing the World WarII filmMidway.[6]Due to its potential lofty budget (with estimates putting its needed cost at $125million), Emmerich had trouble getting the film greenlit. When no major studio would bankroll the project, he cut down on potential battle sequences and turned to individuals for the funds, resulting in $76million; he then got an additional $24million in equity, mostly from Chinese investors, resulting in the film's $100million budget. It is one of the most costlyindependent filmsever made.[3]Emmerich had previously attempted to mount the film atSony Picturesin the 1990s, withWilliam Goldmanbecoming interested in the project. However, as with the final rendition, executives balked at the proposed $100million budget ($152million by 2019 inflation), and Emmerich moved on to directThe Patriot.[7]

The site's critics consensus reads: "Midwayrevisits a well-known story with modern special effects and a more balanced point of view, but its screenplay isn't quite ready for battle."[30]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 28 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[31]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an average 4 out of 5 stars, with 58% saying they would definitely recommend it.[23]
Barry Hertz ofThe Globe and Mailgave the film a score of 2/4 stars, describing it as "a Second World War epic that runs a comparatively paltry 138 minutes yet feels about five times as long", concluding that the film was "a choppy bore, its main source of intrigue centred around whatever New Jersey-ese accent British actor Ed Skrein is attempting as dive bomber Richard Best."[32]Michael O'Sullivan ofThe Washington Postgave the film a score of 2.5/4 stars, saying that it "tells a story that's vividly and viscerally rendered, with all the entertainment value of a big, old-fashioned war movie", but added: "the kiss-kiss never really registers with quite the same impact as the bang-bang."[33]Wendy Ide ofThe Observergave the film a score of 2/5 stars, writing: "Every tired war movie cliche is unearthed in a film that brings nothing new but will no doubt please fans of men in uniform yelling at explosions."[34]
Paul Byrnes ofThe Sydney Morning Heraldgave the film a score of 3/5 stars, describing it as "one of [Roland Emmerich's] better films", but added: "There are a number of earlier versions to pick from, including John Ford's original 18-minute Oscar-winning documentary. We didn't need a new one, unless he had something new to say or a new way to say it. To both questions, the answer is no."[35]Owen GleibermanofVarietywrote: "The film's drama is B-movie basic. But the destructive colliding metal-on-metal inferno of what war is what makesMidwaya picture worth seeing."[36]Kenneth Turan of theLos Angeles Timesdescribed the film as being "so square, so old-school and old-fashioned, it almost feels avant-garde", adding: "It aims to celebrate heroism, sacrifice, determination and grit, and if you don't like that it really does not care."[37]
While the film takes some artistic license, Emmerich and Tooke were both adamant about being historically accurate, andMidwayreceived praise from some combat veterans and historians for being a more accurate portrayal of events thanMidway(1976) andPearl Harbor(2001).Naval History and Heritage Commanddirector and retired Navy Rear Admiral Sam Cox said: "Despite some of the 'Hollywood' aspects, this is still the most realistic movie about naval combat ever made."[38]
Several seemingly "Hollywood-ized" events depicted in the film, such asBruno Gaidosprinting into a parked plane to shoot down a crippled plane attempting to crash into theEnterprise, then getting promoted on the spot, occurred as shown, though according toUSA Today, "Gaido hid after shooting the plane down, afraid he was going to get in trouble for leaving his battle station.  "They had to hunt him down and bring him to Halsey", said retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Samuel J. Cox, director of theNaval History and Heritage Command.[39]
