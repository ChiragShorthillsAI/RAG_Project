Dark Watersis a 2019 Americanlegal thrillerfilm directed byTodd Haynesand written by Mario Correa andMatthew Michael Carnahan. The story dramatizesRobert Bilott's case against the chemical manufacturing corporationDuPontafter they contaminated a town with unregulated chemicals. It starsMark Ruffaloas Bilott, along withAnne Hathaway,Tim Robbins,Bill Camp,Victor Garber,Mare Winningham,William Jackson Harper, andBill Pullman.
The film is based on the 2016New York Times Magazinearticle "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare" byNathaniel Rich.[2][3]An account of the investigation and case was first publicized in the bookStain-Resistant, Nonstick, Waterproof and Lethal: The Hidden Dangers ofC8(2007) by Callie Lyons, a Mid-Ohio Valley journalist who covered the controversy as it was unfolding.[4]Parts of the pollution and coverup story were also reported by Mariah Blake, whose 2015 article "Welcome to Beautiful Parkersburg, West Virginia" was a National Magazine Award finalist,[5]andSharon Lerner, whose series "Bad Chemistry" ran inThe Intercept.[6][7]Bilott wrote his own memoir,Exposure(2019),[8]detailing his 20-year legal battle against DuPont.[9]
Focus FeaturesgaveDark Watersalimited theatrical releaseon November 22, 2019, before releasing itwideon December 6. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed $23 million.
In 1998,Robert Bilottis a corporate defense lawyer fromCincinnatiworking for the law firmTaft Stettinius & Hollister. Farmer Wilbur Tennant, who knows Bilott's  grandmother, asks him to investigate the numerous deaths of dairy cattle at his farm inParkersburg, West Virginia. Tennant connects the deaths to the chemical manufacturing corporationDuPontand gives Robert a large case of videotapes related to the case.
Robert visits the Tennants' farm, where he learns that 190 cows have died after exhibiting unusual medical conditions, such as bloated organs, blackened teeth, and tumors. DuPont attorney Phil Donnelly says he is not aware of Tennant's concerns, but will help in any way he can. Bilott files a small suit to gain information throughlegal discoveryof the chemicals dumped at a nearby landfill. When he finds nothing useful in theEPAreport, he realizes the chemicals might be unregulated.
Bilott confronts Donnelly at an industry event, leading to an angry exchange. In response to his request to broaden discovery, DuPont sends hundreds of boxes. Bilott finds numerous references to something called "PFOA", but has difficulty learning about it. He learns that PFOA isperfluorooctanoic acid, which DuPont uses to manufactureTeflon, a substance widely used in American homes for nonstick frying pans and carpet flooring. The company has been running tests of the effect of PFOA for decades, finding that it causes cancer and congenital disabilities, but kept the findings private. Dupont dumped several tons of toxic sludge in a landfill uphill from Tennant's farm. PFOA and similar compounds areforever chemicals, chemicals that never leave the bloodstream andslowly accumulate.
The local community shuns Tennant for suing their most significant employer. Bilott encourages him to accept DuPont's settlement, but he refuses, wanting justice, and reveals that both he and his wife have cancer. Bilott sends a summary and supporting documentation of the DuPont issues to the EPA andUnited States Department of Justice, among others. The EPA fines DuPont $16.5 million.
Bilott is unsatisfied, as he realizes the residents of Parkersburg will continue to suffer the effects of the PFOA and more will likely die from disease. He seeks an agreement for DuPont to pay formedical monitoringfor all residents of Parkersburg in one largeclass-action lawsuit. However, DuPont sends a deceptive letter notifying residents of the presence of PFOA, thus starting thestatute of limitationsrunning, giving any further legal action only 12 months to begin.
Since PFOA is unregulated, Robert's team argues that the corporation is liable, as the amount in contaminated waters was 6 times higher than the 1 part per billion deemed safe by DuPont's internal documents. In court, DuPont claims that theWest Virginia Department of Environmental Protectionhas recently found that 150 parts per billion are safe (contradicting DuPont's scientific findings since the 1970s).
The locals protest, and the story becomes national news. DuPont agrees to settle for benefits valued at over $300 million. It is agreed inmediationthat the company will carry out medical monitoring only if it is proven that PFOA caused the ailments, and an independent science panel is set up. To gather data, Robert's team tells locals they can get their settlement money after they donate blood samples for testing. Nearly 70,000 people donate to the study.
Seven years pass with no results from the science panel. Tennant dies, and Bilott suffers financially following several pay cuts, since the case is not providing revenue. His marriage and health are strained.
Finally, the science panel contacts Bilott and tells him that they linked PFOA exposure to an increased incidence of two types of cancer and four other diseases in Parkersburg. His celebration is short-lived, however, as DuPont decides to withdraw from the mediated agreement. Bilott defiantly decides to sue the company separately for each Parkersburg resident with an illness that would have been covered by the medical monitoring (which currently includes over 3,500 individuals), and juries award his first three clients multi-million dollar settlements. In response, DuPont settles the remaining cases for $671 million.
Cameo appearancesare made by the real-life Rob Bilott, his wife, Sarah, and their sons, Teddy, Charlie, and Tony, as well as Darlene and Joe Kiger, Jim Tennant, and Crystal Wheeler and Amy Brode (Wilbur Tennant's daughters). William "Bucky" Bailey, whose mother Sue worked on the Teflon line in a Dupont facility and has the PFOA-induced "one nostril and eye defect" discussed in the film as having been found in DuPont's own (previously hidden) 1981 pregnancy study, appears as himself in the film.
On September 21, 2018, it was announced thatTodd Hayneswould direct the film, then titledDry Run, from a rewrite by Mario Correa of a script whose first draft was penned byMatthew Michael Carnahan,[10]and that it would be produced byParticipant Mediaalong withMark Ruffalo.[11]In November, Ruffalo was officially set to star in the film.[12]
In January 2019,Anne Hathaway,Tim Robbins,Bill Camp,Victor Garber,Mare Winningham,William Jackson Harper, andBill Pullmanjoined the cast of the film, withChristine VachonandPamela Kofflerproducing under theirKiller Filmsbanner.[13]Principal photographybegan on January 14 inCincinnati,Ohio.[13][14]
The film premiered at theWalter Reade Theateron November 12, 2019.[15]It began itslimited releasein the United States on November 22, beforegoing wideon December 6.[16]In Canada, the film was released onNetflixon April 1, 2022, and it became the number one movie on Netflix Canada the next day.
Dark Watershas grossed more than $11.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $11.9 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of over $23.1 million.[1]
Its opening weekend, the film made $102,656 from four theaters, a per-venue average of $25,651.[16]It expanded to 94 theaters the following weekend, making $630,000.[17]The film went wide its third weekend of release, making $4.1 million from 2,012 theaters, and then made $1.9 million its fourth weekend.[18][19]
On the filmreview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 89% of 236 critics' reviews of the film are positive, with an average rating of 7.3/10; the site's "critics consensus" reads: "Dark Waterspowerfully relays a real-life tale of infuriating malfeasance, honoring the victims and laying blame squarely at the feet of the perpetrators."[20]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted averagescore of 73 out of 100, based on reviews from 38 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[21]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an average of 3.5 out of 5 stars, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it to a friend.[18]
TheDowDuPontbreakup earlier in the year spun off a new DuPont company that continued to lose value throughout the second half of 2019 as investors grew concerned about the potential liabilities related to the old DuPont's fluoropolymer products. WhenDark Waterswas released on November 12, DuPont's stock price dropped a further 7.15 points, from 72.18 to 65.03. While the portfolio is now a part ofChemours, and the companies settled the public health lawsuits referenced in the film, Chemours sued DuPont, alleging that the former parent company saddled it with onerous liabilities when it failed to prepare financial projections in good faith. Chemours estimated that it would need to pay over $200 million to address environmental damages in North Carolina caused by anotherPFASmanufacturing facility in that region. (The prior settlement in both West Virginia and Ohio cost $671 million, which was split between the two companies.)[22]
DuPont CEO Marc Doyle, executives, and investors argued in internal statements that much of the movie was not based in fact and DuPont was misconstrued to fit the role of the enemy. According to Doyle, limited public statements were made because "in a situation like this, it just doesn't do you much good to fight it out in the public eye. That would just drive more and more attention to it." Executive chairman Ed Breen would not comment on whether DuPont would take legal action in response to the movie, but he did tell investors, "Obviously, we have a lot of legal folks [that] have been looking at this."[23]Many of the executives with whom this movie draws fault still work, or recently worked, at DuPont.
3Msaw little to no change in its stock price the day of the film's release, but it was already experiencing a "difficult year" from "potential liabilities due to possible litigation over previous production of PFAS."[24]The company's stock price closed at 256.01 on January 28, 2018, and by December 1, 2019, it had fallen to 168.27.[25]
Many outlets felt the film was snubbed by the92nd Academy Awardsand77th Golden Globe Awards, as it did not receive any nominations at either ceremony.[26][27][28]

Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Participant Media, LLCwas an American independentfilmand television production company founded in 2004 byJeffrey Skoll, dedicated to entertainment intended to spur social change.[1]The company financed and co-produced film and television content, as well asdigital entertainmentthrough its subsidiary SoulPancake, which the company acquired in 2016.[2]
The company was originally named Participant Productions and went on to become a well-known independent financier. The company's name descriptively politicizes[3]its basis on currentlytopicalsubjects presented to induce awareness of problematic social aspects.[4][5][6]
The company produced, financed, or co-produced 135 films and five television series. Its films have been nominated for 73 Academy Awards, and have won 18, including Best Picture forGreen BookandSpotlight.[7][8][9][10]
Participant, which earnedB Corpcertification in 2017,[11]was the largest company that exclusively produces and financessocial impact entertainment.[12]
On April16, 2024, Skoll announced that the company would be ceasing operations after two decades, with nearly all of its staff being dismissed and development of new content shutting down entirely.[13]
The company was founded in January 2004 asParticipant ProductionsbyJeffrey Skoll, the "second employee" ofeBay,[14][8]with $100 million in cash from his  personal funds.[4]Its goal was to produce projects that would be both commercially viable and socially relevant.[15]
Skoll was the company's first chief executive officer, but stepped down in August 2006.[4]The firm's initial plans were to produce four to six films per year, each with a budget of $40 million.[5][15]It focused on films in six areas –  the environment, health care, human rights, institutional responsibility, peace and tolerance, and social and economic justice.[4]It evaluated projects by running them past its creative executives first, only then assessing their cost and commercial viability, and  analyzing their social relevance last.[4][16]Once the decision was made to go ahead with production, the company askednon-profit organizationsto build campaigns around the release.[4][5]In some cases, the studio has spent years creating positive word-of-mouth with advocacy groups, which are often encouraged to use the film to push their own agendas.[17]
The new company quickly announced an ambitious slate of productions. Its first film was thedrama filmAmerican Gun(2005), withequity partnerIFC Films.[5][6]Two weeks later, the company announced aco-productiondeal withWarner Bros.on two films – thegeopoliticalthriller filmSyriana(2005) and the drama filmClass Action(later re-titledNorth Country)(2005).[6][18]Participant Productions contributed half the budget of each film.[6]Its fourth production, a documentary film, was announced in November 2004. TitledThe World According to Sesame Street(2005), the film examined the impact of the children's television showSesame Streeton world culture, focusing onKosovo,Bangladesh,South AfricaandEl Salvador.[19][20]At the same time, the company began to implement anenvironmentally friendlystrategy:Syrianawas the company's firstcarbon-neutralproduction, and the company createdcarbon offsetsfor the documentary filmAn Inconvenient Truth(2006).[21]
In 2005, the company suffered its first stumble. It again agreed to co-finance a picture with Warner Bros.,Vadim Perelman's second feature,Truce.[22]Although Perelman claimed he had "never been moved by a script to such an extent",[22]the film never went into production.[23]North Countrydid poorly at the box office despite recent Academy Award-winnerCharlize Theronin the lead.[7]The World According to Sesame Streetnever found a distributor for theatrical release, and eventually only aired onPBStelevision,Sesame Street's broadcast home.[7]
The company announced in March 2005 that it would executive produce the Warner Bros. drama filmGood Night, and Good Luck.[24]At theCannes Film Festivalin May, the company bought the right to distribute the forthcoming drama filmFast Food Nation(2006)  directed byRichard Linklaterin North America in return for an equity stake.[25][26]A month later, it bought distribution rights to the documentaryMurderballin return for an equity stake.[27]It also executive produced and co-financedAl Gore'sglobal-warmingdocumentary,An Inconvenient Truth.[20][28][29][30]
As heavier production scheduling grew, the company added staff. Ricky Strauss was named the first president in March 2005, with oversight ofproduction,marketingand business development.[31]Attorney and former non-profit chief executive Meredith Blake was hired in June as its Senior Vice President of Corporate and Community Affairs,[32]to oversee development of awareness and outreach campaigns around the social issues raised in the company's films in cooperation with non-profit organizations, corporations, andearned media.[32]Diane Weyermann, director of theSundance Institute's Documentary Film Program, joined the company in October 2005 as Executive Vice President of Documentary Production.[33]
The company's non-film-production efforts continued to grow. The company provided an undisclosed amount of financing in February 2005 to film distributorEmerging Picturesto finance that company's national network ofdigitally equipped cinemas(with Emerging Pictures distributing Participant's films).[34]The company also began its first socially relevant outreach project, helping to finance screenings of thebiographical filmGandhi(1982) in thePalestinian territoriesfor the first time as well as in the countries ofIsrael,Jordan,LebanonandSyria.[35]In support of its upcoming film,An Inconvenient Truth,the studio negotiated a deal for distributorParamount Classicsto donate five percent of its U.S. domestic theatrical gross box-office receipts (with a guarantee of $500,000) to theAlliance for Climate Protection.[36]
The company had a very successful 2005 awards season, with eleven Academy Award nominations and one win.[7]Good Night, and Good Luckgarnered six nominations, includingBest Art Direction,Best Cinematography,Best Director(George Clooney),Best Picture,Best Actor in a Leading Role(David Strathairn) andBest Original Screenplay.[37]Murderballwas nominated forBest Documentary Feature.[37]North Countrywas nominated forBest Actress in a Leading Role(Charlize Theron) andBest Actress in a Supporting Role(Frances McDormand).[37]Syrianawas nominated forBest Actor in a Supporting Role(George Clooney) andBest Original Screenplay.[37]But of the eleven nominations, onlyGeorge Clooneywon forBest Actor in a Supporting RoleinSyriana.[38]
In June, the company announced it would partner withNew Line Cinema(a subsidiary of Warner Bros.) to produceThe Crusaders, a drama aboutBrown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), a landmark ruling of theSupreme Court of the United Stateswhich endedracial segregationinpublic schools.[39]But the film never got beyond the development stage. In September, the company entered into an agreement to co-produce the drama filmThe Visitor(2008) withGroundswell Productions,[40]and two months later agreed to co-produce (withSony Pictures Classics) a documentary film aboutthe Abu Ghraib torture scandal,Standard Operating Procedure(2008), directed byErrol Morris.[41]
The company also took an equity position in and a co-production credit forChicago 10(2007), ananimated documentaryfilm about the 1969Chicago Sevenconspiracy trial.[42][43]
Finally, in December, the company agreed to finance and produce the documentary filmMan from Plains(2007), directed byJonathan Demme, that followed formerU.S. PresidentJimmy Carteras he promoted hispolitical-sciencebook,Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid(2006).[44]
The company also co-financed, withWarner Independent Pictures, the documentary filmDarfur Now(2007),[45]and, withUniversal Studiosand others, co-financed thebiographical filmCharlie Wilson's War(2007).[46]The film had the biggest budget of any of the company's films sinceSyriana.[7]
Three major corporate events also occurred in 2006.
The company's success continued through the 2006 awards season.An Inconvenient Truthwas nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Documentary Feature, and the song "I Need to Wake Up" (byMelissa Etheridge) nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Original Song.[51]The film and song won their respective categories in February 2007.[52][53]
Corporate growth continued in 2007. On January 8, the company hired motion-picture marketing veterans Buffy Shutt and Kathy Jones, both Executive Vice President of Marketing, to coordinate marketing of the company's films.[54]Eight days later, the company hiredTony Award- andEmmy Award-winning event producer John Schreiber as Executive Vice President of Social Action and Advocacy to enhance the company's earned media, non-profit and corporate outreach and advocacy campaigns.[55]
February saw the hire of Adrian Sexton as Executive Vice President to oversee digital and global media projects,[56]and April saw veteran production head Jonathan King join the company as Executive Vice President of Production.[57]Lynn Hirshfield was hired in May as Vice President of Business Development to launch the company's publishing division,[58]and saw Bonnie Abaunza and Liana Schwarz both Vice President of Social Action Campaign Development and Operations to assist with social outreach and advocacy campaigns in mid-June.[59]
In November, the company signed a deal with actressNatalie Portman's newly formed production company, Handsomecharlie Films, under which the two studios would co-produce socially relevant films for a two-year period. No films were produced under this agreement, however.[60]The same month, the company hired veteranShowtimeproducer John Moser to oversee development and production of original programs for television and home cable.[61]But despite the management activity and expansion, not all of the company's films did well.Chicago 10did not sell for several months after it premiered at Sundance, and only significant editing and a reduction in running time led to a distribution deal.[7]
The company also announced additional productions. In January, it said it was co-financing the drama filmThe Kite Runner(2007) withSidney Kimmel EntertainmentandDreamWorks Pictures, the latter company then owned byViacomviaParamount Pictures.[54]The Kite Runnerwas the first collaboration between both Participant and DreamWorks; the two companies would not collaborate again untilThe Helpin 2011. That spring, the company took an equity position inAngels in the Dust(2007), a documentary film about children orphaned byAIDS, and paid the filmmaker to update the film and shoot more footage.[7]
In April, it closed a deal with Warner Independent to turnRandy Shilts' biographical book,The Mayor of Castro Street(1982) into a film,[62]but the project entered development hell, as well as the feature-length documentary about the2007 Live Earthconcert later.[63]Five months later the company agreed   (withBroken Lizard) to co-produce and co-finance the company's first comedy film,Taildraggers, revolving around five pilots trying to stop oil extraction from an Alaskan preserve.[64]As of June 2009, however, the film had not been produced.[65]
Participant then signed a co-production deal with State Street Pictures to finance the biographical drama,Bobby Martinezaboutthe eponymous Latino surferin November.[66]The film entered development hell for nearly two years but hired Ric Roman Waugh to rewrite and direct in April 2009,[67]with supposed production by the beginning of 2012. By the end of 2007, the company was seen as a key player in documentary production.[68]
In March 2008, Participant Productions changed its name to Participant Media to reflect the firm's expansion into television and non-traditional entertainment media.[69]
The company continued to expand its social advocacy and outreach efforts in 2008. On January 16, 2008, it joined and made a financial contribution to a $100 millionUnited Nations-sponsored fund which would provide backing for films which combatted religious, ethnic, racial, and other stereotypes.[70]Fueling the company's expansion was the creation of a $250 million fund with Image Nation, a start-up film studio based in theUnited Arab Emirateswhich is a division of theAbu Dhabi Media Company.[71]Each company contributed roughly half of the fund's total (although some funding came from loans).[71]Participant and Image Nation agreed to produce 18 films over the next five years, which would add approximately four feature-length films per year to Participant's existing slate.[71][72]To boost its marketing efforts, the company also hired Jeffrey Sakson as Vice President of Publicity in April 2008.[73]In September 2008, Participant Media andPublicAffairs Bookssigned a deal under which PublicAffairs would publish four original paperback books designed to expand upon the social messages in Participant's films.[74]The first book to be published under the pact wasFood Inc.: A Participant Guide: How Industrial Food Is Making Us Sicker, Fatter, and Poorer—And What You Can Do About It.[74]The company also founded a new Web site,TakePart.com, to promote Participant Media's films as well as make viewers aware of the social advocacy efforts of Participant's outreach partners.[75]In 2009, the company signed a first look deal with Summit Entertainment.[76]
In March, Participant announced a co-financing deal with Tapestry Films to produceMinimum Wage, a comedy about a corrupt corporate executive sentenced to live for a year on aminimum wagesalary.[69]It was not produced. A month later, the company announced it and Groundswell Productions were co-financingThe Informant!, a comedy directed bySteven Soderberghand starringMatt Damonabout thelysine price-fixing conspiracyatArcher Daniels Midlandin the mid-1990s.[77][78]July saw Participant set up a co-financing deal with three other studios to produceThe Colony, an eco-horror film.[79]It, too, was never produced.
The 2007 awards season saw several more Academy Award nominations for the company's films. Its films had a combined sevenGolden Globe Awardnominations, although it won none.[80]Philip Seymour Hoffmanwas nominated for hissupporting actor roleinCharlie Wilson's War,Richard Jenkinswas nominated for Best Actor inThe Visitor, andAlberto Iglesiaswas nominated forbest original scoreforThe Kite Runner.[81]But the studio won no Oscars that year.[clarification needed]The success during awards season did not extend into 2008. The company had only three films released during the year (Every Little Step,Pressure Cooker, andStandard Operating Procedure), and none of them was nominated for an award from a major arts organization. However, on November 19, 2008, the Producers Guild of America gave Participant founder Jeff Skoll its Visionary Award.[82]
In 2009, it saw the company continue to aggressively produce both feature films and documentaries. In January, it announced that it would producePaul Dinello'sMr. Burnout(about aburned outteacher seeking to rekindle his love of teaching)[83]andFurry Vengeance(a comedy starringBrendan Fraserabout anOregonreal estate developer who is opposed by animals).[78][84]But onlyFurry Vengeancewas produced. That same month Participant signed a five-year production and distribution deal with Summit Entertainment. The agreement, which covered titles financed by Participant's $250 million production agreement with Imagination Media, was nonexclusive (meaning Participant could seek distribution of films by other companies) and was limited to four projects a year.[50]The agreement allowed Summit to charge a distribution fee, and to co-finance titles if it wished.[50]The pact covered home video and pay-television distribution as well.[50]Furry Vengeancewas the first picture produced under the agreement.[84]In April, the company hired screenwriter Miles Chapman to pen an untitled environmentally themed action-adventure script about the hunt for a mystical gem in the heart of Africa.[85]The script went into development hell. The same month, the company agreed to co-finance (with Krasnoff/Foster Entertainment) a biographical drama titledHistory on Trial—which was intended to document the true story ofDeborah Lipstadt, a professor ofJewish studieswho was sued byHolocaust deniersDavid Irvingforlibel.[86][87]The film was not produced, but the company did go on to makeDenial, starring Rachel Weisz, about the same subject in 2016. The company also announced a number of productions in May 2009, including:The Crazies, a remake of the1973 film of the same name;[88]Casino Jack and the United States of Money,a film about theJack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal;[89]Help Me Spread Goodness, a comedy starring and directed byBen Stillerabout a banking executive who is caught by aNigerian Internet scam(the film was not produced);[90][91]andThe Soloist, a drama starringJamie FoxxandRobert Downey, Jr.based on the true story ofNathaniel Ayers, a brilliant musician who developsschizophreniaand becomeshomeless.[78]
The company also expanded in non-film production as well. In March, Participant agreed to conduct outreach and social advocacy efforts on behalf of theLionsgate/Roadside AttractionsdocumentaryThe Coveabout dolphin slaughters by Japanese villagers in a cove near fishing grounds.[92]The firm's TakePart website also released a newiPhoneapplication, Givabit, which solicits charitable donations for Participant Media's nonprofit advocacy partners from iPhone users once a day.[75]In June, the company established a new book publishing subsidiary, headed by Vice President of Publishing Lynn Hirshfield (who changed titles within the company).[74][93]Liana Schwarz was promoted to Senior Vice President of Campaign Development and Operations.[94]
On January 28, 2010, Participant Media co-presented director Mark Lewis' documentary,Cane Toads: The Conquestat the Sundance Film Festival.[95]The film, according toDaily Varietysaid, was the "first specialty doc filmed in digital 3D."[95]A month later, Bonnie Stylides left Summit Entertainment to become Participant's Senior Vice-President of Business Affairs.[96]The studio's hit documentary,Waiting for "Superman", garnered media acclaim, and Participant inked a worldwide distribution deal withParamountshortly before its premiere at Sundance.[97]It also sold North American distribution rights for its documentary,Countdown to Zero, toMagnolia Pictures,[98]and distribution rights to its documentaryClimate of Changeto Tribeca Film (a division ofRobert De Niro's Tribeca Enterprises).[99]
The company also received a $248,000 grant from theRobert Wood Johnson Foundationto raise awareness about access to quality food and childhood obesity.[100]The studio used these funds to create a campaign linked to its promotional efforts for the documentary filmFood, Inc.and signed a deal with Active Media to help run the campaign.[100]It    signed a deal with Planet Illogica (a website collaboratively produced by artists, filmmakers, musicians, and fashion designers) to generate a social action campaign associated with its documentaryOceans(which was released byWalt Disney Pictures).[101]The "Save My Oceans Tour" involved concerts, art installations, and screenings ofOceanson college campuses.[102]
On April 13, Noah Manduke (former president of the consulting firm Durable Good and president of the marketing firmSiegel + Gale) was named chief strategy officer of the Jeff Skoll Group.[103]Skoll created the Skoll Group to oversee his various enterprises, including Participant Media, and Manduke began working with Skoll and Participant Media's top management to begin a strategic planning process and strengthen collaboration between Participant and Skoll's other organizations and companies.[103]The following month, studio executive James Berk was one of only 180 individuals invited to join theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[104]
Based on the success of itsTwilight Sagafilm series, Summit Entertainment announced on March 8, 2011, that it was making a $750 million debt refinancing with cash distribution to its investors, which included Participant Media.[105]
On June 5,The New York Timesran a major story about the studio, declaring: "Participant Media, the film industry's most visible attempt at social entrepreneurship, turned seven this year without quite sorting out whether a company that trades in movies with a message can earn its way in a business that has been tough even for those who peddle 3-D pandas and such."[106]AuthorMichael Cieplynoted thatThe Beaver, Participant's latest released, cost $20 million but had garnered just $1 million in gross box-office sales after a month in theaters –  making the film a "flop".[106]The company's biggest success to date, the newspaper noted, was 2007'sCharlie Wilson's War($66.7 million in gross domestic box office revenue).[106]Skoll was quoted as saying that he had poured "hundreds of millions to date [into the company], with much more to follow", and that the studio had yet to break even.[106]Skoll and Berk, however, noted that Participant Media performs slightly above-average when compared to similarly-sized peers.[106]The advantage came in three areas: home video sales, the company's long-term attempts to build social movements around its films, and its stake in Summit Entertainment (which allowed it to win more favorable distribution terms).[106]
TheTimessaid that audiences may be turned off by Participant's relentless focus on upsetting issues, quoting unnamed sources.[106]The company hoped that it would change this attitude about its films (and make money) with 2011'sThe Help(about racial reconciliation in the American South during the 1960s) andContagion(aSteven Soderberghpicture about the outbreak of a virulent, deadly disease).[106]Skoll also said that Participant had purchased the rights to aNew York Timesarticle about theDeepwater Horizonoil spillof 2010, and that the film would likely focus not simply on oil drilling, but on a number of critical issues, such as climate change and the ecological health of oceans.[106]
By year's end, however, there was less concern about the company's financial future. The studio's $25 million film about racial reconciliation (about a third of the production budget came from Participant),[107]The Help, cleared $100 million in late August,[108]and was just short of $200 million worldwide by late December.[109]The Helpwas the first film since 2010'sInceptionto be number one at the North American box office for three straight weekends in a row,[110]and was only unseated by another Participant Media film,Contagion.[111]The Helpwas nominated for fourAcademy Awards: The film for Best Picture,Viola Davisfor Best Actress, andJessica ChastainandOctavia Spencerfor Best Supporting Actress. Spencer won the Oscar for her role.[112]
Participant executives said on October 14, 2011 that the studio would expand its production to make seven to twelve films per year, would begin producing features and series for television, and would expand its online presence.[113]As part of this plan, in November the studio hired advertising executive Chad Boettcher to be executive vice president for social action and advocacy and20th Century Foxexecutive Gary Frenkel to be senior vice president for digital products and communities.[114]
In January 2012, Participant Media made its first investment in a non-English-language film, the forthcomingPablo Larraínmotion pictureNo(starringGael Garcia Bernal).[115]The semi-biographical film tells the story of a man who initiates an upbeat, innocuous advertising campaign that helps to unseatChileandictator GeneralAugusto Pinochetduring the 1988plebiscitethat led to theChilean transition to democracy. The same month, however, it lost its president, Ricky Strauss, who departed the studio to become head of worldwide marketing at Walt Disney Pictures.[116]
Three weeks later, on February 2, 2012, Participant Media announced that it was partnering with Summit Entertainment,Image Nation, Spanish production company Apaches Entertainment, and Colombian production company Dynamo to produce a supernatural horror film about an American oil company executive who moves his family into a house in a small city inColombia, only to find the home is haunted. The company announced that Spanish director Luis Quilez would direct from a script by Alex and David Pastor (who developed their script with funding from Participant).[117]

Pete Saunders, a survivor who was appointed to the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors and who arranged the February 4th screening, was asked to take a leave of absence shortly thereafter. Shortly after winning multiple Oscars, including Best Picture, the Vatican's newspaper praisedSpotlightfor exposing these abuses.[129][130][131]The film, however, did face controversy including some criticism from an author ofThe New York Timescalling it, "a misrepresentation of how the Church dealt with sexual abuse cases", arguing that the movie's biggest flaw was its failure to portray psychologists who had assured Church officials that abusive priests could be safely returned to ministry after undergoing therapy treatments.[132]Another criticism was that the film falsely portrayed Jack Dunn, the public relations head and a member of the board atBoston College High School, as a member of the Boston Archdiocesan cover-up (for which the dialogue itself was mythologised).[133][134]
On February 28, 2016, the company won its first Best Picture Academy Award forSpotlight. The acclaimed drama also picked up the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer).

The success ofRomaled to a cultural moment in 2019 called the "Roma Effect," which helped increase visibility and raise awareness for domestic workers in the U.S. and Mexico, where the Mexican Congress voted to pass legislation granting domestic workers access to basic labor rights, such as limited work hours and paid vacation.[150]That year, then-SenatorKamala Harrisand RepresentativePramila Jayapalintroduced the National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights into the US Congress.[151]
In collaboration with theUCLA School of Theater, Film and Television'sSkoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment, Participant published the "State of SIE" report, similar to what it had done a few years earlier with USC when it published the "Participant Index" report. These reports are rare exceptions to Participant Media usually keeping its impact strategies proprietary.
On September 8, 2019, Participant debuted its rebrand and logo at the Toronto Film Festival which coincided with the company's 15th anniversary.[1]The company's rebrand was followed by the announcement thatDavid Lindeextended his contract as CEO of the consumer-engaged brand with a multi-year deal.[152]

Via theDark Waterscampaign, Mark Ruffalo became an outspoken advocate against forever chemicals. He testified in front of Congress[153]about the harms of PFAS and met with North Carolina government officials[154]to ask for stronger action. In 2024, theUnited States Environmental Protection Agencyannounced a first-ever drinking water standard[155]to limit forever chemicals and Mark Ruffalo issued a statement saying to the communities affected by pollution: “Your voices have been heard."[156]

On April 16, 2024, founder Jeff Skoll informed Participant's staff of his decision to shut the company down. The decision was attributed to changes over time in content creation and distribution, especially difficulties in developing successful streaming business models and suspension of production on multiple projects due to the2023 Hollywood labor disputes. Sources state almost all of the company's staff would be laid off, with a holding company owning Participant's interests in its library of 140 titles. Participant will continue to be involved in certain projects in stages of completion, although it will no longer develop any new content.[13]

Linked page for 'Todd Haynes' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Haynes):
Todd Haynes(/heɪnz/; born January 2, 1961) is an American film director,  screenwriter, and producer. His films span four decades with themes examining the personalities of well-known musicians, dysfunctional and dystopian societies, and blurred gender roles.
Haynes first gained public attention with his controversial short filmSuperstar: The Karen Carpenter Story(1987), which chronicles singerKaren Carpenter's life and death using Barbie dolls as actors.[a]Superstarbecame acult classic.[1][2]His feature directorial debut,Poison(1991), a provocative exploration of AIDS-era perceptions and subversions, established him as a figure of a new transgressive cinema.Poisonwon theSundance Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize.
Haynes received further acclaim for his second feature film,Safe(1995), a symbolic portrait of a housewife who developsmultiple chemical sensitivity.Safewas later voted the best film of the 1990s byThe Village VoiceFilm Poll. His next feature,Velvet Goldmine(1998), is a tribute to the 1970sglam rockera. The film received the Special Jury Prize for Best Artistic Contribution at the1998 Cannes Film Festival.
Haynes gained acclaim and a measure of mainstream success withFar from Heaven(2002), receiving his firstAcademy Awardnomination forBest Original Screenplay. He continued to direct critically lauded films such asI'm Not There(2007),Carol(2015),Wonderstruck(2017),Dark Waters(2019), andMay December(2023), as well as the documentary filmThe Velvet Underground(2021). Haynes also directed and co-wrote theHBOmini-seriesMildred Pierce(2011), for which he received threePrimetime Emmy Awardnominations.
Haynes was born January 2, 1961, inLos Angeles, and grew up in the city'sEncinoneighborhood.[3][4]His father, Allen E. Haynes, was a cosmetics importer, and his mother, Sherry Lynne (née Semler), studied acting. Haynes is Jewish on his mother's side.[5][6]His younger sister is Gwynneth Haynes of the bandSophe Lux.[7]
Haynes developed an interest in film at an early age, and produced a short film,The Suicide(1978), while still in high school. He studied art andsemioticsatBrown University, where he directed his first short filmAssassins: A Film Concerning Rimbaud(1985), inspired by the French poetArthur Rimbaud(a personality Haynes would later reference in his filmI'm Not There). At Brown, he metChristine Vachon, who would go on to produce all of his feature films. After graduating from Brown, Haynes moved toNew York Cityand became involved in the independent film scene, launching Apparatus Productions, a non-profit organization for the support of independent film.[1]
According toCinematic/Sexual: An Interview with Todd Haynes, in response to whether his academic background affected his film-making practice, Haynes stated that his high school teacher taught him a valuable lesson: "Reality can't be a criterion for judging the success or failure of a film, or its effect on you. It was a simple, but eye-opening, way of approaching film."[8]
In 1987, while an MFA student atBard College, Haynes made a short,Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story, which chronicles the life of American pop singerKaren Carpenter, using Barbie dolls as actors.[1]The film presents Carpenter's struggle with anorexia and bulimia, featuring several close-ups ofIpecac(the nonprescription drug Carpenter was reputed to have used to make herself vomit during her illness). Carpenter's chronic weight loss was portrayed by using a "Karen" Barbie doll with the face and body whittled away with a knife, leaving the doll looking skeletonized.
Superstarfeatured extensive use of Carpenter songs, showcasing Haynes's love of popular music (which would be a recurring feature of later films). Haynes failed to obtain proper licensing to use the music, prompting a lawsuit from Karen's brotherRichardfor copyright infringement. Carpenter was reportedly also offended by Haynes's unflattering portrayal of him as a narcissistic bully, along with several broadly dropped suggestions that he was gay andin the closet. Carpenter won his lawsuit, andSuperstarwas removed from public distribution; to date, it may not be viewed publicly.[1]Bootlegged versions of the film are still circulated, and the film is sporadically made available on YouTube.[9][10]
Haynes's 1991 feature film debut,Poison, garnered him further acclaim and controversy.[1]Drawing on the writings of gay writerJean Genet, the film is a triptych ofqueer-themed narratives, each adopting a different cinematic genre: vox-pop documentary ("Hero"), 50s sci-fi horror ("Horror") and gay prisoner romantic drama ("Homo"). The film explores traditional perceptions of homosexuality as an unnatural and deviant force, and presents Genet's vision ofsado-masochisticgay relations as a subversion of heterosexual norms, culminating with a marriage ceremony between two gay male convicts.Poisonmarked Haynes's first collaboration with his longtime producerChristine Vachon.
Poisonwas partially funded with a grant from theNational Endowment for the Arts(NEA),[1]"at a time when the agency was under attack from conservative groups for using public funds to support sexually explicit works".[11]This, along with the film's sexual themes, was a source of controversy.[11][1]The film subsequently became the center of a public attack byReverend Donald Wildmon, head of theAmerican Family Association, who criticized the NEA for fundingPoisonand other works by gay and lesbian artists and filmmakers. Wildmon, who had not viewed the film before making his comments publicly,[12]condemned the film's "explicit porno scenes of homosexuals involved in anal sex", despite no such scenes appearing in the film.[13]Poisonwent on to win the 1991Sundance Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize, establishing Haynes as an emerging talent and the voice of a new transgressive generation.[1][14][15]The film writerB. Ruby RichcitedPoisonas one of the defining films of the emergingNew Queer Cinemamovement, with its focus on maverick sexuality as an anti-establishment social force.[16][17]
Haynes's next short film,Dottie Gets Spanked(1993), explored the experiences of a quiet and gentle six-year-old boy in the early 1960s who has various indirect encounters with spanking, most significantly involving his idol, a TV sitcom star named Dottie. The film was aired onPBS.[1]
Haynes's second feature film,Safe(1995), was a critically acclaimed portrait of Carol White, a San Fernando Valley housewife (played byJulianne Moore) who develops violent allergies to her middle-class suburban existence.[1]After a series of extreme allergic reactions and hospitalization, Carol diagnoses herself with acute environmental illness, and moves to aNew Agecommune in theNew Mexicodesert run by anHIV positive"guru" who preaches both that the real world is toxic and unsafe for Carol, and that she is responsible for her illness and recovery. The film ends with Carol retreating to her antiseptic, prison-like "safe room", looking at herself in the mirror and whispering "I love you" to her reflection.
The film is notable for its critical (though not entirely unsympathetic) treatment of its main character. Julie Grossman argues in her article "The Trouble With Carol" that Haynes concludes the film as a challenge to traditional Hollywood film narratives of the heroine taking charge of her life, and that Haynes sets Carol up as the victim both of a repressive male-dominated society, and also of an equally debilitatingself-helpculture that encourages patients to take sole responsibility for their illness and recovery.[18]Carol's illness, although unidentified, has been read as an analogy for the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s, as a similarly uncomfortable and largely unspoken "threat" in 1980s Reaganist America.[1][19]Safewas critically acclaimed, giving Moore her first leading role in a feature film, and gave Haynes a measure of mainstream critical recognition.[1]It was voted the best film of the 1990s by the Village Voice's Critic Poll.[20]The film historianDavid Thomsonlater described it as "one of the most arresting, original and accomplished films of the 1990s".[21]
Haynes took a radical shift in direction for his next feature,Velvet Goldmine(1998), starringChristian Bale,Ewan McGregor,Jonathan Rhys-MeyersandToni Collette. The film's title takes its name fromDavid Bowie's song "Velvet Goldmine".[22]Filmed and set mostly in England, the film was an intentionally chaotic tribute to the 1970s glam rock era, drawing heavily on the rock histories and mythologies of glam rockersDavid Bowie,Iggy PopandLou Reed. Starting withOscar Wildeas the spiritual godfather of glam rock, the film revels in the gender and identity experimentation and fashionable bisexuality of the era, and acknowledges the transformative power of glam rock as an escape and a form of self-expression for gay teenagers.[citation needed]
The film follows the character of Arthur (Bale) an English journalist once enraptured by glam rock as a 1970s teenager, who returns a decade later to hunt down his former heroes: Brian Slade (Rhys Meyers), a feather boa-wearingandrogynewith an alter ego, "Maxwell Demon", who resembles Bowie in hisZiggy Stardustincarnation, and Curt Wild (McGregor), an Iggy Pop-style rocker. The narrative playfully rewrites glam rock myths which in some cases sail unnervingly close to the truth.[citation needed]Slade flirts with bisexuality and decadence before staging his own death in a live performance and disappearing from the scene, echoing Bowie's own disavowal of glam rock in the late 1970s and his subsequent re-creation as an avowedly heterosexual pop star. The film features a love affair between Slade and Wild's characters, recalling rumors about Bowie and Reed's supposed sexual relationship. Curt Wild's character has a flashback to enforcedelectric shock treatmentas a teenager to attempt to cure his homosexuality, echoing Reed's teenage experiences as a victim of the homophobic medical profession.
Haynes was keen to use original music from the glam rock period, and (learning his lesson fromSuperstar)[citation needed]approached David Bowie before making the film for permission to use his music in the soundtrack. Bowie declined, leaving Haynes to use a combination of original songs from other artists and glam-rock inspired music written by contemporary rock bands for the film, includingSuede.[citation needed]Velvet Goldminepremiered in main competition at the1998 Cannes Film Festival, winning a special jury award for Best Artistic Contribution.[23]Despite the initial critical praise, the film received mixed reviews from critics.[citation needed]Costume designerSandy Powellreceived anAcademy Awardnomination for her costume design and won the Oscar in the same year for her work onShakespeare In Love.[24]
Haynes achieved his greatest critical and commercial success to date withFar from Heaven(2002), a 1950s-set drama inspired by the films ofDouglas Sirkabout a Connecticut housewife Cathy Whittaker (Julianne Moore) who discovers that her husband (Dennis Quaid) is secretly gay, and subsequently falls in love with Raymond, her African-American gardener (Dennis Haysbert). The film works as a mostly reverential and unironic tribute to Sirk's filmmaking, lovingly re-creating the stylizedmise-en-scene, colors, costumes, cinematography and lighting of Sirkianmelodrama. Cathy and Raymond's relationship resemblesJane WymanandRock Hudson's inter-class love affair inAll That Heaven Allows,and Cathy's relationship with Sybil, her African-American housekeeper (Viola Davis) recallsLana TurnerandJuanita Moore's friendship inImitation of Life. While staying within the cinematic language of the period, Haynes updates the sexual and racial politics, showing scenarios (an inter-racial love affair and gay relationships) that would not have been permissible in Sirk's era. Haynes also resists a Sirkian happy ending, allowing the film to finish on a melancholy note closer in tone to the "weepy" melodramas of the 1940s and 1950s cinema such asMildred Pierce.
Far from Heavendebuted at theVenice Film Festivalto widespread critical acclaim and garnered a slew of film awards, including theVolpi Cupfor Moore, and four Academy Award nominations: lead actress for Moore, Haynes's original screenplay,Elmer Bernstein's score, andEdward Lachman's cinematography.Far from Heavenlost in all four categories, but the film's success was hailed as a breakthrough for independent film achieving mainstream recognition and brought Haynes to the attention of a wider mainstream audience.[1]
In another radical shift in direction, Haynes's next filmI'm Not There(2007) returned to the mythology of popular music, portraying the life and legend ofBob Dylanthrough seven fictional characters played by six actors:Richard Gere,Cate Blanchett,Marcus Carl Franklin,Heath Ledger,Ben WhishawandChristian Bale. Haynes obtained Dylan's approval to proceed with the film, and the rights to use his music in the soundtrack, after presenting a one-page summary of the film's concept to Jeff Rosen, Dylan's long-time manager.[25]I'm Not Therepremiered at theVenice Film Festivalto critical acclaim, where Haynes won theGrand Jury Prizeand Blanchett won the Volpi Cup, eventually receiving an Academy Award nomination forBest Supporting Actress.[26][27]
Haynes's next project wasMildred Pierce, a five-hour miniseries forHBObased on the novel byJames M. Cainand the 1945 film starringJoan Crawford. The series starredKate Winsletin the title role and featuredGuy Pearce,Evan Rachel Wood,Melissa Leo,James LeGrosandHope Davis. Filming was completed in mid-2010 and the series began airing on HBO on 27 March 2011. It received 21Primetime Emmy Awardnominations, winning five, and Winslet won aGolden Globe Awardfor her performance.[28][29]
Haynes's sixth feature film,Carol, is an adaptation of the 1952 novelThe Price of SaltbyPatricia Highsmith. The cast featuresCate Blanchett,Rooney Mara,Sarah PaulsonandKyle Chandler. The film premiered in competition at the2015 Cannes Film Festival, where it won theQueer Palmand a shared Best Actress prize for Mara.[30][31]Carolreceived critical acclaim[32]and was nominated for 6 Academy Awards, 5 Golden Globe Awards, 9BAFTA Awards, and 6Independent Spirit Awards.[33][34][35][36]Geoffrey McNab ofThe Independentpraised the film praising Haynes writing "In sly and subversive fashion, Haynes is laying bare the tensions in a society that refuses to acknowledge "difference" of any sort". McNabb added, "They are both helped that in Todd Haynes, they have a director who is sensitive to every last nuance in their performances".[37]
On October 20, 2017, Haynes'sWonderstruckwas released, having premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2017. The film is an adaptation ofBrian Selznick's children's bookof the same name.WonderstruckstarsJulianne Mooreand is produced by Haynes's collaboratorChristine VachonandAmazon Studios, which is also distributing the film.[38][39]The movie describes two deaf children, one in 1927 and the other in 1977, who embark on separate quests to find themselves. When asked why he'd made a children's movie, in his October 15, 2017, NPR interview, Haynes explained, "I felt like it spoke to something indomitable about the nature of kids and the ability for kids to be confronted with challenges and the unknown and to keep muscling through those challenges."[40]The film received mixed reviews but earned praise forEdward Lachman'sblack-and-whitecinematography.
Haynes directed a film titledDark WatersforParticipant Media.[41][42]The film is based onNathaniel Rich'sNew York Times Magazinearticle “The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare,” which is about corporate defense attorneyRobert Bilottand his environmental lawsuit against the American conglomerateDuPont.[43]Mark RuffaloandAnne Hathawaystar,[44]and principal photography began in January 2019, inCincinnati.[45]The film was released on November 22, 2019.[46]
Haynes's premiered his first documentary feature,The Velvet Underground, at theCannes Film Festivalon July 7, 2021, and it went on to be released on October 15, 2021, in theaters and onApple TV+, to critical acclaim. The film rejects documentary biopic tropes, evoking a place and time through extensive use of montage. “What montage can do is always more sophisticated than we give it credit for,” Haynes says. “I wanted the audience to fill in the holes themselves and make their own discoveries and feel like these ideas are alive again, because they’re coming through you, and they’re not just being told to us like in a lecture.”[47]Haynes was nominated for theCritics' Choice Documentary Award for Best First Documentary Feature.[48]
Haynes's latest film,May December, reunites him with frequent collaborator Julianne Moore and co-starsNatalie PortmanandCharles Melton. The film, loosely based aroundMary Kay Letourneau, revolves around a married couple whose relationship is put through a test after an actress arrives to do research for a film about their past. The script was written bySamy Burch, with a story by Burch andAlex Mechanik.[49][50]The film was shot in Savannah, Georgia, and wrapped filming in December 2022.[51]The film received positive reviews[52]with Peter Debruge ofVarietywriting, "Todd Haynes unpacks America’s obsession with scandal and the impossibility of ever truly knowing what motivates others in this layered look at the actor’s process."[53]The film went on to receive nominations for fourGolden Globe AwardsincludingBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.[54]Haynes himself was nominated for theIndependent Spirit Award for Best Director.[55]
In 2023, Todd Haynes was given a Moving Image Award by theMuseum of the Moving Image(MOMI) in New York City. MOMI also curated a retrospective of his work, and published a book,Todd Haynes: Rapturous Process.[56]
Haynes said in September 2023 that he has been working on a sexually explicit film about a "love story between two men set in the 1930's", starringJoaquin Phoenix.[57]The project was cancelled shortly before production began when Phoenix abruptly quit.[58]
In 2015 he was reported to be developing a TV series based on the 2012 documentaryThe Source FamilyforHBO.[38][59]
Haynes is set to direct aPeggy Leebiopic, titledFever, based on a screenplay originally drafted byNora Ephronbefore her death in 2012, starringMichelle Williamsin the title role afterReese Witherspoonbacked out of the role to produce instead.Billie Eilishis in early talks to executive produce. The primary screenwriter is nowDoug Wright.[60]
Haynes is reportedly set to direct the HBO seriesTrust,based on Hernan Diaz'snovel of the same name,  withKate Winsletas the lead after working together onMildred Pierce.[61][62]
AllMoviewrites that "Haynes is known for making provocative films that subvert narrative structure and resound with transgressive, complexeroticism. ... Although he doesn't characterize himself as a gay filmmaker who makes gay films … Haynes' name has become synonymous with theNew Queer Cinemamovement and its work to both explore and redefine the contours of queer culture in America and beyond."[63]
Haynes's work is preoccupied withpostmodernistideas of identity and sexuality as socially constructed concepts and personal identity as a fluid and changeable state. His protagonists are invariably social outsiders whose "subversive" identity and sexuality put them at odds with the received norms of their society. In the Haynes universe, sexuality (especially "deviant" or unconventional sexuality) is a subversive and dangerous force that disrupts social norms and is often repressed brutally by dominant power structures. Haynes presents artists as the ultimate subversive force since they must necessarily stand outside of societal norms, with an artist's creative output representing the greatest opportunity for personal and social freedom. Many of his films are unconventional portraits of popular artists and musicians (Karen CarpenterinSuperstar,David BowieinVelvet GoldmineandBob DylaninI'm Not There).[citation needed]
Haynes's films often feature formal cinematic or narrative devices that challenge received notions of identity and sexuality and remind the audience of the artificiality of film as a medium. Examples include usingBarbie dollsinstead of actors inSuperstaror having multiple actors portray the protagonist inI'm Not There. Stylistically, Haynes favors formalism over naturalism, often appropriating and reinventing cinematic styles, including the documentary form inPoison,Velvet GoldmineandI'm Not There, the reinvention of theDouglas SirkmelodramainFar from Heavenand extensive referencing of 1960s art cinema inI'm Not There.[citation needed]
Haynes is gay,[64][65][66]and identifies asirreligious.[67]After living in New York City for more than a decade, Haynes moved toPortland, Oregon, in 2002.[4][68]He has been in a relationship with Bryan O'Keefe, an archival producer, since 2002.[69]
An edited book of personal interviews was published in 2014, titledTodd Haynes: Interviews.[70]

He made his directorial and screenwriting debut withBob Roberts(also 1992), amockumentaryabout a right-wingsenatorialcandidate.Todd McCarthyinVarietycommented that the film is "both a stimulating social satire and, for thinking people, a depressing commentary on the devolution of the American political system".[14]Robbins then starred alongsideMorgan FreemaninThe Shawshank Redemption(1994), which was based onStephen King'snovella.[15]
Robbins has written, produced, and directed several films with strong social content, such as the capital punishment sagaDead Man Walking(1995), starring Sarandon andSean Penn. The film earned him anOscarnomination forBest Director. According toRoger Ebertin early 1996: "With this film he leaps far beyond"Bob Roberts"and has made that rare thing, a film that is an exercise of philosophy. This is the kind of movie that spoils us for other films, because it reveals so starkly how most movies fall into conventional routine, and lull us with the reassurance that they will not look too hard, or probe too deeply, or make us think beyond the boundaries of what is comfortable".[16]
His next directorial effort wasDepression-era musicalCradle Will Rock(1999).

He was originally offered the chance to record an album in 1992 after the success of his filmBob Roberts, but he declined because he had "too much respect for the process", having seen his father work so hard as a musician, and because he felt he had nothing to say at the time.[22]

It resonated for me immediately, and it resonated for them as well, because they have seen their town get misinterpreted and represented in ridiculous ways," he toldThe Times-Picayunein 2011. "Something about this show was different for them. I appreciated that. I loved the writing and the actors. I loved the environment it's set in. I watched the whole first season in New Orleans, and got in touch withDavid Simonand said, 'If you guys need a director next year, I'd be happy to do an episode.'"[25]
