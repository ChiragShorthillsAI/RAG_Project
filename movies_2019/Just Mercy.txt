Just Mercyis a 2019 Americanbiographicallegal dramafilm co-written and directed byDestin Daniel Crettonand starringMichael B. JordanasBryan Stevenson,Jamie FoxxasWalter McMillian,Rob Morgan,Tim Blake Nelson,Rafe Spall, andBrie Larson. It explores the work of young defense attorney Bryan Stevenson who represents poor people on death row in theSouth. Featured is his work with Walter McMillian, who had been wrongfully convicted of the murder of a young woman. The film is based on Stevenson's 2014same-titled memoir, in which he explored his journey to making his life's work the defense of African American prisoners.[4]
Just Mercy, which had its world premiere at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 6, 2019, was theatrically released byWarner Bros. Pictureson December 25, 2019. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed $50.4 million. Foxx was nominated forOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Roleat the26th Screen Actors Guild Awards. Both he and Michael B. Jordan wonNAACP Image Awardsfor their respective roles.
In 1989,Harvard lawgraduateBryan Stevensontravels toAlabama, intending to help defend poor people who cannot afford proper legal representation. Teaming with Eva Ansley, he forms theEqual Justice Initiativein the state capital,Montgomery. He embarks on trying to combat social injustices in criminal law and practice, which have resulted in a high rate of African Americans convicted and incarcerated in the state and nationwide.
Stevenson goes to a state prison to meet inmates who are ondeath rowand who are seeking appeals of their convictions or sentences. Among these isWalter "Johnny D." McMillian, an African-American man who was convicted of the 1986 murder of Ronda Morrison, an 18-year-old white girl. McMillian has maintained his innocence.
When Stevenson reviews the evidence in the case, he learns that it hinges entirely on the testimony of convicted felon Ralph Myers. The convict had provided highly contradictory testimony to the prosecution in exchange for a plea deal and lighter sentence in his own pending trial.
Given these issues, Stevenson appeals to the current prosecutor, Tommy Chapman, for aid; he dismisses him without looking at his notes. Stevenson learns that, at the time of the murder, McMillian's family friend Darnell Houston was elsewhere with a witness who had subsequently falsely corroborated Myers' testimony. This evidence would cause the prosecution's case to fall apart, so Stevenson asks Houston to testify to his account. When Stevenson submits his testimony, police arrest Houston forperjury.
Although Stevenson gets the perjury charges dismissed, Houston is intimidated, so he refuses to testify in court. Shortly afterward, Stevenson is threatened by two sheriff deputies, who force him from his car at gunpoint and illegally search the car. They refuse to tell him why he was pulled over, but release him.
During this period, Stevenson had a case on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of another death row inmate,Herbert Lee Richardson; the court denied the appeal. Convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend’s niece with a bomb on her porch, Richardson had been sentenced to death by electric chair. Unable to get it overturned, Stevenson promises to be with Richardson in his final moments, and witnesses the execution.
On behalf of McMillian, Stevenson directly confronts Myers. He admits that police coerced his testimony by threatening him with a death sentence. Stevenson appeals to the local court to grant McMillian a retrial and successfully convinces Myers to recant his testimony on the stand, but the judge refuses to grant it.
Stevenson appears on60 Minutesto rally public support in favor of McMillian, and appeals the court's decision to theSupreme Court of Alabama. The Supreme Court overturns the circuit court's decision, and grants McMillian a retrial. Stevenson tries to have the charges dismissed entirely. He confronts Chapman at home and tries to convince him to join in this motion; Chapman forces him to leave.
On the day of the motion, Stevenson appeals to the judge. That day, Chapman joins him in the motion, the judge dismisses the charges, and McMillian is finally released from prison and reunited with his family.
An epilogue notes that Stevenson and Ansley continue their fight for justice. McMillian remained friends with Stevenson until his natural death in 2013. A follow-up investigation into Morrison's 1986 murder confirmed McMillian's innocence. Evidence suggested that a white man was likely responsible, but the case has never been officially solved. McMillian's former cellmate,Anthony Ray Hinton, remained on death row for 28 years. Stevenson handled his defense and was eventually able to get all the charges dropped. Hinton was released in 2015.

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]
Warner Bros. owns some shared universes. Some of them are based on books and comics, including some of the highest grossing IP's in the movie industry.

Participant Media, LLCwas an American independentfilmand television production company founded in 2004 byJeffrey Skoll, dedicated to entertainment intended to spur social change.[1]The company financed and co-produced film and television content, as well asdigital entertainmentthrough its subsidiary SoulPancake, which the company acquired in 2016.[2]
The company was originally named Participant Productions and went on to become a well-known independent financier. The company's name descriptively politicizes[3]its basis on currentlytopicalsubjects presented to induce awareness of problematic social aspects.[4][5][6]
The company produced, financed, or co-produced 135 films and five television series. Its films have been nominated for 73 Academy Awards, and have won 18, including Best Picture forGreen BookandSpotlight.[7][8][9][10]
Participant, which earnedB Corpcertification in 2017,[11]was the largest company that exclusively produces and financessocial impact entertainment.[12]
On April16, 2024, Skoll announced that the company would be ceasing operations after two decades, with nearly all of its staff being dismissed and development of new content shutting down entirely.[13]
The company was founded in January 2004 asParticipant ProductionsbyJeffrey Skoll, the "second employee" ofeBay,[14][8]with $100 million in cash from his  personal funds.[4]Its goal was to produce projects that would be both commercially viable and socially relevant.[15]
Skoll was the company's first chief executive officer, but stepped down in August 2006.[4]The firm's initial plans were to produce four to six films per year, each with a budget of $40 million.[5][15]It focused on films in six areas –  the environment, health care, human rights, institutional responsibility, peace and tolerance, and social and economic justice.[4]It evaluated projects by running them past its creative executives first, only then assessing their cost and commercial viability, and  analyzing their social relevance last.[4][16]Once the decision was made to go ahead with production, the company askednon-profit organizationsto build campaigns around the release.[4][5]In some cases, the studio has spent years creating positive word-of-mouth with advocacy groups, which are often encouraged to use the film to push their own agendas.[17]
The new company quickly announced an ambitious slate of productions. Its first film was thedrama filmAmerican Gun(2005), withequity partnerIFC Films.[5][6]Two weeks later, the company announced aco-productiondeal withWarner Bros.on two films – thegeopoliticalthriller filmSyriana(2005) and the drama filmClass Action(later re-titledNorth Country)(2005).[6][18]Participant Productions contributed half the budget of each film.[6]Its fourth production, a documentary film, was announced in November 2004. TitledThe World According to Sesame Street(2005), the film examined the impact of the children's television showSesame Streeton world culture, focusing onKosovo,Bangladesh,South AfricaandEl Salvador.[19][20]At the same time, the company began to implement anenvironmentally friendlystrategy:Syrianawas the company's firstcarbon-neutralproduction, and the company createdcarbon offsetsfor the documentary filmAn Inconvenient Truth(2006).[21]
In 2005, the company suffered its first stumble. It again agreed to co-finance a picture with Warner Bros.,Vadim Perelman's second feature,Truce.[22]Although Perelman claimed he had "never been moved by a script to such an extent",[22]the film never went into production.[23]North Countrydid poorly at the box office despite recent Academy Award-winnerCharlize Theronin the lead.[7]The World According to Sesame Streetnever found a distributor for theatrical release, and eventually only aired onPBStelevision,Sesame Street's broadcast home.[7]
The company announced in March 2005 that it would executive produce the Warner Bros. drama filmGood Night, and Good Luck.[24]At theCannes Film Festivalin May, the company bought the right to distribute the forthcoming drama filmFast Food Nation(2006)  directed byRichard Linklaterin North America in return for an equity stake.[25][26]A month later, it bought distribution rights to the documentaryMurderballin return for an equity stake.[27]It also executive produced and co-financedAl Gore'sglobal-warmingdocumentary,An Inconvenient Truth.[20][28][29][30]
As heavier production scheduling grew, the company added staff. Ricky Strauss was named the first president in March 2005, with oversight ofproduction,marketingand business development.[31]Attorney and former non-profit chief executive Meredith Blake was hired in June as its Senior Vice President of Corporate and Community Affairs,[32]to oversee development of awareness and outreach campaigns around the social issues raised in the company's films in cooperation with non-profit organizations, corporations, andearned media.[32]Diane Weyermann, director of theSundance Institute's Documentary Film Program, joined the company in October 2005 as Executive Vice President of Documentary Production.[33]
The company's non-film-production efforts continued to grow. The company provided an undisclosed amount of financing in February 2005 to film distributorEmerging Picturesto finance that company's national network ofdigitally equipped cinemas(with Emerging Pictures distributing Participant's films).[34]The company also began its first socially relevant outreach project, helping to finance screenings of thebiographical filmGandhi(1982) in thePalestinian territoriesfor the first time as well as in the countries ofIsrael,Jordan,LebanonandSyria.[35]In support of its upcoming film,An Inconvenient Truth,the studio negotiated a deal for distributorParamount Classicsto donate five percent of its U.S. domestic theatrical gross box-office receipts (with a guarantee of $500,000) to theAlliance for Climate Protection.[36]
The company had a very successful 2005 awards season, with eleven Academy Award nominations and one win.[7]Good Night, and Good Luckgarnered six nominations, includingBest Art Direction,Best Cinematography,Best Director(George Clooney),Best Picture,Best Actor in a Leading Role(David Strathairn) andBest Original Screenplay.[37]Murderballwas nominated forBest Documentary Feature.[37]North Countrywas nominated forBest Actress in a Leading Role(Charlize Theron) andBest Actress in a Supporting Role(Frances McDormand).[37]Syrianawas nominated forBest Actor in a Supporting Role(George Clooney) andBest Original Screenplay.[37]But of the eleven nominations, onlyGeorge Clooneywon forBest Actor in a Supporting RoleinSyriana.[38]
In June, the company announced it would partner withNew Line Cinema(a subsidiary of Warner Bros.) to produceThe Crusaders, a drama aboutBrown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), a landmark ruling of theSupreme Court of the United Stateswhich endedracial segregationinpublic schools.[39]But the film never got beyond the development stage. In September, the company entered into an agreement to co-produce the drama filmThe Visitor(2008) withGroundswell Productions,[40]and two months later agreed to co-produce (withSony Pictures Classics) a documentary film aboutthe Abu Ghraib torture scandal,Standard Operating Procedure(2008), directed byErrol Morris.[41]
The company also took an equity position in and a co-production credit forChicago 10(2007), ananimated documentaryfilm about the 1969Chicago Sevenconspiracy trial.[42][43]
Finally, in December, the company agreed to finance and produce the documentary filmMan from Plains(2007), directed byJonathan Demme, that followed formerU.S. PresidentJimmy Carteras he promoted hispolitical-sciencebook,Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid(2006).[44]
The company also co-financed, withWarner Independent Pictures, the documentary filmDarfur Now(2007),[45]and, withUniversal Studiosand others, co-financed thebiographical filmCharlie Wilson's War(2007).[46]The film had the biggest budget of any of the company's films sinceSyriana.[7]
Three major corporate events also occurred in 2006.
The company's success continued through the 2006 awards season.An Inconvenient Truthwas nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Documentary Feature, and the song "I Need to Wake Up" (byMelissa Etheridge) nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Original Song.[51]The film and song won their respective categories in February 2007.[52][53]
Corporate growth continued in 2007. On January 8, the company hired motion-picture marketing veterans Buffy Shutt and Kathy Jones, both Executive Vice President of Marketing, to coordinate marketing of the company's films.[54]Eight days later, the company hiredTony Award- andEmmy Award-winning event producer John Schreiber as Executive Vice President of Social Action and Advocacy to enhance the company's earned media, non-profit and corporate outreach and advocacy campaigns.[55]
February saw the hire of Adrian Sexton as Executive Vice President to oversee digital and global media projects,[56]and April saw veteran production head Jonathan King join the company as Executive Vice President of Production.[57]Lynn Hirshfield was hired in May as Vice President of Business Development to launch the company's publishing division,[58]and saw Bonnie Abaunza and Liana Schwarz both Vice President of Social Action Campaign Development and Operations to assist with social outreach and advocacy campaigns in mid-June.[59]
In November, the company signed a deal with actressNatalie Portman's newly formed production company, Handsomecharlie Films, under which the two studios would co-produce socially relevant films for a two-year period. No films were produced under this agreement, however.[60]The same month, the company hired veteranShowtimeproducer John Moser to oversee development and production of original programs for television and home cable.[61]But despite the management activity and expansion, not all of the company's films did well.Chicago 10did not sell for several months after it premiered at Sundance, and only significant editing and a reduction in running time led to a distribution deal.[7]
The company also announced additional productions. In January, it said it was co-financing the drama filmThe Kite Runner(2007) withSidney Kimmel EntertainmentandDreamWorks Pictures, the latter company then owned byViacomviaParamount Pictures.[54]The Kite Runnerwas the first collaboration between both Participant and DreamWorks; the two companies would not collaborate again untilThe Helpin 2011. That spring, the company took an equity position inAngels in the Dust(2007), a documentary film about children orphaned byAIDS, and paid the filmmaker to update the film and shoot more footage.[7]
In April, it closed a deal with Warner Independent to turnRandy Shilts' biographical book,The Mayor of Castro Street(1982) into a film,[62]but the project entered development hell, as well as the feature-length documentary about the2007 Live Earthconcert later.[63]Five months later the company agreed   (withBroken Lizard) to co-produce and co-finance the company's first comedy film,Taildraggers, revolving around five pilots trying to stop oil extraction from an Alaskan preserve.[64]As of June 2009, however, the film had not been produced.[65]
Participant then signed a co-production deal with State Street Pictures to finance the biographical drama,Bobby Martinezaboutthe eponymous Latino surferin November.[66]The film entered development hell for nearly two years but hired Ric Roman Waugh to rewrite and direct in April 2009,[67]with supposed production by the beginning of 2012. By the end of 2007, the company was seen as a key player in documentary production.[68]
In March 2008, Participant Productions changed its name to Participant Media to reflect the firm's expansion into television and non-traditional entertainment media.[69]
The company continued to expand its social advocacy and outreach efforts in 2008. On January 16, 2008, it joined and made a financial contribution to a $100 millionUnited Nations-sponsored fund which would provide backing for films which combatted religious, ethnic, racial, and other stereotypes.[70]Fueling the company's expansion was the creation of a $250 million fund with Image Nation, a start-up film studio based in theUnited Arab Emirateswhich is a division of theAbu Dhabi Media Company.[71]Each company contributed roughly half of the fund's total (although some funding came from loans).[71]Participant and Image Nation agreed to produce 18 films over the next five years, which would add approximately four feature-length films per year to Participant's existing slate.[71][72]To boost its marketing efforts, the company also hired Jeffrey Sakson as Vice President of Publicity in April 2008.[73]In September 2008, Participant Media andPublicAffairs Bookssigned a deal under which PublicAffairs would publish four original paperback books designed to expand upon the social messages in Participant's films.[74]The first book to be published under the pact wasFood Inc.: A Participant Guide: How Industrial Food Is Making Us Sicker, Fatter, and Poorer—And What You Can Do About It.[74]The company also founded a new Web site,TakePart.com, to promote Participant Media's films as well as make viewers aware of the social advocacy efforts of Participant's outreach partners.[75]In 2009, the company signed a first look deal with Summit Entertainment.[76]
In March, Participant announced a co-financing deal with Tapestry Films to produceMinimum Wage, a comedy about a corrupt corporate executive sentenced to live for a year on aminimum wagesalary.[69]It was not produced. A month later, the company announced it and Groundswell Productions were co-financingThe Informant!, a comedy directed bySteven Soderberghand starringMatt Damonabout thelysine price-fixing conspiracyatArcher Daniels Midlandin the mid-1990s.[77][78]July saw Participant set up a co-financing deal with three other studios to produceThe Colony, an eco-horror film.[79]It, too, was never produced.
The 2007 awards season saw several more Academy Award nominations for the company's films. Its films had a combined sevenGolden Globe Awardnominations, although it won none.[80]Philip Seymour Hoffmanwas nominated for hissupporting actor roleinCharlie Wilson's War,Richard Jenkinswas nominated for Best Actor inThe Visitor, andAlberto Iglesiaswas nominated forbest original scoreforThe Kite Runner.[81]But the studio won no Oscars that year.[clarification needed]The success during awards season did not extend into 2008. The company had only three films released during the year (Every Little Step,Pressure Cooker, andStandard Operating Procedure), and none of them was nominated for an award from a major arts organization. However, on November 19, 2008, the Producers Guild of America gave Participant founder Jeff Skoll its Visionary Award.[82]

That same month Participant signed a five-year production and distribution deal with Summit Entertainment. The agreement, which covered titles financed by Participant's $250 million production agreement with Imagination Media, was nonexclusive (meaning Participant could seek distribution of films by other companies) and was limited to four projects a year.[50]The agreement allowed Summit to charge a distribution fee, and to co-finance titles if it wished.[50]The pact covered home video and pay-television distribution as well.[50]Furry Vengeancewas the first picture produced under the agreement.[84]In April, the company hired screenwriter Miles Chapman to pen an untitled environmentally themed action-adventure script about the hunt for a mystical gem in the heart of Africa.[85]The script went into development hell. The same month, the company agreed to co-finance (with Krasnoff/Foster Entertainment) a biographical drama titledHistory on Trial—which was intended to document the true story ofDeborah Lipstadt, a professor ofJewish studieswho was sued byHolocaust deniersDavid Irvingforlibel.[86][87]The film was not produced, but the company did go on to makeDenial, starring Rachel Weisz, about the same subject in 2016.

On January 28, 2010, Participant Media co-presented director Mark Lewis' documentary,Cane Toads: The Conquestat the Sundance Film Festival.[95]The film, according toDaily Varietysaid, was the "first specialty doc filmed in digital 3D."[95]A month later, Bonnie Stylides left Summit Entertainment to become Participant's Senior Vice-President of Business Affairs.[96]The studio's hit documentary,Waiting for "Superman", garnered media acclaim, and Participant inked a worldwide distribution deal withParamountshortly before its premiere at Sundance.[97]It also sold North American distribution rights for its documentary,Countdown to Zero, toMagnolia Pictures,[98]and distribution rights to its documentaryClimate of Changeto Tribeca Film (a division ofRobert De Niro's Tribeca Enterprises).[99]
The company also received a $248,000 grant from theRobert Wood Johnson Foundationto raise awareness about access to quality food and childhood obesity.[100]The studio used these funds to create a campaign linked to its promotional efforts for the documentary filmFood, Inc.and signed a deal with Active Media to help run the campaign.[100]It    signed a deal with Planet Illogica (a website collaboratively produced by artists, filmmakers, musicians, and fashion designers) to generate a social action campaign associated with its documentaryOceans(which was released byWalt Disney Pictures).[101]The "Save My Oceans Tour" involved concerts, art installations, and screenings ofOceanson college campuses.[102]

Based on the success of itsTwilight Sagafilm series, Summit Entertainment announced on March 8, 2011, that it was making a $750 million debt refinancing with cash distribution to its investors, which included Participant Media.[105]
On June 5,The New York Timesran a major story about the studio, declaring: "Participant Media, the film industry's most visible attempt at social entrepreneurship, turned seven this year without quite sorting out whether a company that trades in movies with a message can earn its way in a business that has been tough even for those who peddle 3-D pandas and such."[106]AuthorMichael Cieplynoted thatThe Beaver, Participant's latest released, cost $20 million but had garnered just $1 million in gross box-office sales after a month in theaters –  making the film a "flop".[106]The company's biggest success to date, the newspaper noted, was 2007'sCharlie Wilson's War($66.7 million in gross domestic box office revenue).[106]Skoll was quoted as saying that he had poured "hundreds of millions to date [into the company], with much more to follow", and that the studio had yet to break even.[106]Skoll and Berk, however, noted that Participant Media performs slightly above-average when compared to similarly-sized peers.[106]The advantage came in three areas: home video sales, the company's long-term attempts to build social movements around its films, and its stake in Summit Entertainment (which allowed it to win more favorable distribution terms).[106]
TheTimessaid that audiences may be turned off by Participant's relentless focus on upsetting issues, quoting unnamed sources.[106]The company hoped that it would change this attitude about its films (and make money) with 2011'sThe Help(about racial reconciliation in the American South during the 1960s) andContagion(aSteven Soderberghpicture about the outbreak of a virulent, deadly disease).[106]Skoll also said that Participant had purchased the rights to aNew York Timesarticle about theDeepwater Horizonoil spillof 2010, and that the film would likely focus not simply on oil drilling, but on a number of critical issues, such as climate change and the ecological health of oceans.[106]
By year's end, however, there was less concern about the company's financial future. The studio's $25 million film about racial reconciliation (about a third of the production budget came from Participant),[107]The Help, cleared $100 million in late August,[108]and was just short of $200 million worldwide by late December.[109]The Helpwas the first film since 2010'sInceptionto be number one at the North American box office for three straight weekends in a row,[110]and was only unseated by another Participant Media film,Contagion.[111]The Helpwas nominated for fourAcademy Awards: The film for Best Picture,Viola Davisfor Best Actress, andJessica ChastainandOctavia Spencerfor Best Supporting Actress. Spencer won the Oscar for her role.[112]
Participant executives said on October 14, 2011 that the studio would expand its production to make seven to twelve films per year, would begin producing features and series for television, and would expand its online presence.[113]As part of this plan, in November the studio hired advertising executive Chad Boettcher to be executive vice president for social action and advocacy and20th Century Foxexecutive Gary Frenkel to be senior vice president for digital products and communities.[114]
In January 2012, Participant Media made its first investment in a non-English-language film, the forthcomingPablo Larraínmotion pictureNo(starringGael Garcia Bernal).[115]The semi-biographical film tells the story of a man who initiates an upbeat, innocuous advertising campaign that helps to unseatChileandictator GeneralAugusto Pinochetduring the 1988plebiscitethat led to theChilean transition to democracy. The same month, however, it lost its president, Ricky Strauss, who departed the studio to become head of worldwide marketing at Walt Disney Pictures.[116]
Three weeks later, on February 2, 2012, Participant Media announced that it was partnering with Summit Entertainment,Image Nation, Spanish production company Apaches Entertainment, and Colombian production company Dynamo to produce a supernatural horror film about an American oil company executive who moves his family into a house in a small city inColombia, only to find the home is haunted.

Shortly after winning multiple Oscars, including Best Picture, the Vatican's newspaper praisedSpotlightfor exposing these abuses.[129][130][131]The film, however, did face controversy including some criticism from an author ofThe New York Timescalling it, "a misrepresentation of how the Church dealt with sexual abuse cases", arguing that the movie's biggest flaw was its failure to portray psychologists who had assured Church officials that abusive priests could be safely returned to ministry after undergoing therapy treatments.[132]Another criticism was that the film falsely portrayed Jack Dunn, the public relations head and a member of the board atBoston College High School, as a member of the Boston Archdiocesan cover-up (for which the dialogue itself was mythologised).[133][134]
