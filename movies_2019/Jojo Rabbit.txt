A number of tapes ofThe Steve Showwere rediscovered and have been published on various Merchant fan sites.[8]
Merchant was inspired to get into comedy byJohn Cleese.[1]In 2019, he said that he had never met Cleese, but that his parents had recently met him on a cruise and asked him to sign a book for Merchant; they also recorded a voicemail message on the phone in their cabin, which consisted of Cleese saying: "Hello there, Mr and Mrs Merchant, I'd be more than happy to sign your book. I was just wondering is your Stephen Merchant the same Stephen Merchant who collaborated withRicky GervaisonThe Office? Because I'm an enormous fan and please pass on my best regards." On hearing this, Merchant said, "I don't feel I need to meet him now. That's all I needed."[9]
Merchant began his career performing stand-up comedy at Bristol's Comedy Box, where, he recalled: "The first week I did really well. The second week I died on my arse. I realised that stand-up was not that easy after all."[10]He also appeared as a contestant on a 1997 episode of the TV game showBlockbusters[11]and worked for a short time as a DJ forRadio Caroline.[3]
Merchant metRicky Gervaisfor the first time in 1997 when Gervais (in the position Head of Speech at the radio stationXFM London), hired Merchant as his assistant.[12]Gervais later said that he had called Merchant for an interview because it was the firstCVhanded to him.

In the same year, Merchant was a finalist atThe Daily TelegraphOpen Mic Awards.[13]
Merchant worked for seven months at XFM 104.9. The Saturday show never had a large audience. Gervais said: "It's a tinpot radio station... It's not even the biggest radio station in the building." He created the features 'Hip Hop Hooray', 'Make Ricky Gervais Laugh' and 'Song for the Ladies'. After leaving XFM, Merchant began a production course at the BBC. As part of his coursework, he enlisted Gervais to perform in a 30-minute short film, "Seedy Boss", which became the earliest inspiration for their mock documentaryThe Office.[14]They collaborated on a sitcom pilot calledGolden Yearsfeaturing a manager suffering a mid-life crisis. It aired on Channel 4'sComedy Labseries in September 1998,[15]but the show failed to find further success.

Beginning in September 2001, Merchant and Gervais returned to XFM as co-hosts ofThe Ricky Gervais Show, another Saturday afternoon programme, which led to their fruitful relationship with producerKarl Pilkington.[12]
