Playing with Fireis a 2019 Americanfamilycomedyfilm directed byAndy Fickmanfrom a screenplay by Dan Ewen andMatt Liebermanbased on a story by Ewen. The film starsJohn Cena,Keegan-Michael Key,John Leguizamo,Brianna Hildebrand,Dennis Haysbert, andJudy Greer. It tells the story of a group ofsmokejumperswho must watch over three children who they rescued from a burning cabin until child services arrives.
The film was theatrically released byParamount Pictureson November 8, 2019, in the United States. It is the thirdWalden Mediafilm to be produced byNickelodeon MoviesafterCharlotte's WebandDora and the Lost City of Gold(the latter was also released in 2019). The film grossed $69.4 million worldwide with a budget of $29.9 million, but it was panned by critics.
Superintendent Jake Carson is the commanding officer of a group ofsmokejumpersin the remote California woodlands. Carson is capable in a crisis and takes tremendous pride in his work, diving into dangerous situations to rescue civilians alongside his team Mark Rogers, Rodrigo Torres, and "Axe".
After rescuing three children from a burning cabin, Carson is contacted by Division Commander Richards. Richards praises his work and shortlists him to be his replacement, Carson's dream job.
Rogers warns Carson they are responsible for the children's welfare (15-year-old Brynn, 10-year-old Will, and 3-year-old (later 4-year-old) Zoey) under the "Safe Haven Laws", requiring law enforcement and first responders to care for children until they are released to a parent or guardian. He leaves a voicemail for the children's mother who texts back saying that they are on their way. Carson's attempts to complete his application for division commander are undermined by the children running haywire around the station, and the arrival of his ex, local environmentalist Dr. Amy Hicks who protests the smokejumpers taking water from endangered toad habitats to fight fires. She refuses Carson's attempt to offload the children onto her.
Despite the mayhem, the rest of the smokejumpers begin to bond with the children: toddler Zoey warms up to the brutish Axe and Torres teaches Will how to navigate dangerous situations. Brynn pays lip service to Rogers' admiration of Carson, then stages an escape on the station's ATV, spilling oil and slashing tires to prevent chase. Carson catches them by off-roading on a little girl's bike, cornering the children on a dirt road.
Will prompts Brynn to admit they are orphans on the run fromfoster care, avoiding their separation. The text messages were from Brynn herself. The group camp out overnight and Carson promises to hold off callingChild Servicesuntil after Zoey's 4th birthday in two days.
The group go all out preparing Zoey's birthday, and the four smokejumpers buy presents for Brynn and Will as well. Carson then tells Will a bedtime story about ayetiwho was married to his job, had a son and then died on the job because he was distracted by having a family. Brynn and Hicks are both touched by the thinly veiled story of Carson's life. The overboard birthday party is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of both Richards and Child Services. The children flee in Richards' car, running it off the road right on a cliff. Brynn gets trapped in her seat belt. Carson parachutes down to rescue them and with Will's help, he frees Brynn before the car rolls off the cliff.
Back at the station, Hicks and the other smokejumpers bid an emotional farewell to the children. Richards tells Carson that family can be a source of support and that there is more to life than working. Inspired, Carson refuses to release the children to Child Services under the Safe Haven laws and proposes a plan to adopt all three of them.
Sometime later, Carson and Hicks getmarriedwith the smokejumpers and their adopted children in attendance.

Nickelodeon Movies Inc.[1]is an Americanfilm productioncompany based inLos Angeles, Californiaand owned byParamount Global. Originally founded in 1995, it serves as both the film production arm of the American children's networkNickelodeonand the family film distribution label ofParamount Pictures.
The division has earned numerous accolades including twoAcademy Awards, aGolden Globe Award, over 13Saturn Awardsnominations, aPeople's Choice Awardand four in-house honors via theNickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. Since its launch, over 40 feature films have been produced for theatrical release and starting in October 2021, the studio has been producing films for streaming onParamount+andNetflix.
In 1993, Nickelodeon agreed to a two-year contract with20th Century Foxto make feature films. The joint venture would mostly produce new material, though a Nickelodeon executive did not rule out the possibility of making films based onThe Ren & Stimpy Show,RugratsandDoug.[2]None of the movies were produced due to the 1994 acquisition of Paramount Pictures by Nickelodeon's parent company,Viacom, and they would distribute the movies instead. With the creative differences withJohn Kricfalusi, the creator ofRen & Stimpyand an inability to market that property in a family-friendly manner instead of a "cynical and gross humor" scuttled the film.[3][4]However, Paramount and Viacom would go forward and start development onThe Rugrats Moviea year after the acquisition.
The Nickelodeon version of theDougfilm was not made due to the acquisition of the show's production studio,Jumbo Pictures, byThe Walt Disney Companyin 1996. With this, the show moved to Disney'sABCnetwork and new seasons aired as a part of its programming blockDisney's One Saturday MorningasDisney's Doug. In 1999,Walt Disney Picturesreleased a film finale to the series,Doug's 1st Movie.
