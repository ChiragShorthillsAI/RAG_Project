Richard Jewellis a 2019 Americanbiographical dramafilm directed and produced byClint Eastwoodand written byBilly Ray. It is based on the 1997Vanity Fairarticle "American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell" byMarie Brennerand the 2019 bookThe Suspect: An Olympic Bombing, the FBI, the Media, and Richard Jewell, the Man Caught in the Middleby Kent Alexander and Kevin Salwen.[5][6][7][8][9]The film depicts the July 27, 1996,Centennial Olympic Park bombingand its aftermath, as security guardRichard Jewellfinds a bomb during the1996 Summer OlympicsinAtlanta,Georgia, and alerts authorities to evacuate, only to later be wrongly accused of having placed the device himself.Paul Walter Hauserstars as Jewell,[10]supported bySam Rockwell,Kathy Bates,Jon Hamm, andOlivia Wilde.
After its world premiere on November 20, 2019, atAFI Fest, the film was theatrically released in the United States on December 13 byWarner Bros. Pictures. It grossed $44 million against a $45 million budget and received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances (particularly those of Bates, Rockwell, and Hauser) and Eastwood's direction. However, several journalists criticized the film's portrayal of the reporter who first accused Jewell, Kathy Scruggs, specifically its depiction of her trading sex for stories.Richard Jewellwas chosen by theNational Board of Reviewas one of the ten best films of the year, and for her performance in the film Bates won theNational Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actressand was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at both theAcademy Awards[11][12]and theGolden Globes.[13]
In 1986 in Atlanta, Georgia,Richard Jewellis working as an office supply clerk at theSmall Business Administration, where he builds a rapport with attorney Watson Bryant before leaving to pursue a law enforcement career. He is hired as a sheriff's deputy, but is discharged, and by early 1996 is working as a security guard atPiedmont College. He is fired from this position after multiple complaints of acting beyond his jurisdiction and moves in with his mother, Bobi. That summer, he is able to find work as a security guard at theSummer Olympicsin Atlanta, monitoringCentennial Park.
Early in the morning on July 27, 1996, after chasing off some drunken teens during aJack Mack and the Heart Attackconcert, Jewell notices a stray backpack beneath a bench. Much to the annoyance of his coworkers, he insists proper protocol be followed, but an explosives expert discovers the backpack contains a bomb. The security team is still working to move concert attendees away from the bomb when itdetonates, and, though there are many injuries and one fatality, Jewell is heralded as a hero, as his vigilance is believed to have saved many lives.
Thedeanof Piedmont College contacts the FBI to raise suspicions about Jewell, and, after looking into him,  FBI agent Tom Shaw and his team determine that Jewell, as a white, male, "wanna-be" police officer, fits the profile of someone who might seek glory and attention by creating a dangerous situation so they can come to the rescue. Shaw is approached by journalist Kathy Scruggs ofThe Atlanta Journal, and, in exchange for the promise of sexual favors, he reveals Jewell is a suspect in the bombing. TheJournalpublishes Scruggs' story on the front page, and the media narrative about Jewell immediately shifts from laudatory to critical.
Before Jewell learns he is a suspect, Shaw lures him to the FBI office. Though initially cooperative, he becomes suspicious when asked to sign an acknowledgement that he has been read hisMiranda rightsand phones Bryant, who he had just contacted to handle a proposed book deal. Bryant, now running his own struggling law firm, agrees to represent Jewell.
After a disastrousThe Today Showinterview, and still not completely convinced of Jewell's innocence, Bryant and his secretary, Nadya, time how long it takes to travel the distance between the phone booth used to make a bomb threat shortly before the explosion and Centennial Park. Concluding it was impossible for Jewell to both make the threat and discover the bomb when he did, Bryant becomes determined to keep Jewell from getting "railroaded".
The FBI searches Jewell's home and seizes property, including his mother's Tupperware, his true crime books, and a cache of firearms. Jewell admits to Bryant that he has not paid income tax for years and was once arrested for exceeding his authority. Bryant scolds Jewell for being too collegial with the investigators, and Jewell says his ingrained respect for authority makes it difficult for him not to be deferential.
Bryant arranges apolygraphexamination, which Jewell passes. Scruggs, though initially brash and confident in her reporting, is troubled to learn the FBI have begun to look for someone who may have called in the bomb threat for Jewell, since having an accomplice would not fit the "lone bomber" profile. Bobi holds a press conference at which she pleads for the FBI to announce Jewell is no longer a suspect so they may proceed with their lives. Finally, Jewell and Bryant meet with Shaw and, after several irrelevant questions, Jewell pointedly asks if he is going to be charged. Met with silence, he leaves. Eighty-eight days after being named a "person of interest", Jewell is informed by formal letter that he is no longer under investigation.
In April 2003, Jewell, now a police officer inLuthersville, Georgia, is visited by Bryant, who tells him thatEric Rudolphhas been captured and confessed to the Centennial Olympic Park bombing.
An epilogue states that, on August 29, 2007, Jewell died at age 44 of complications fromdiabetesandheart failure. Bryant and Nadya got married, and Bobi babysits their two sons on Saturday nights.
The film was initially announced in February 2014, whenLeonardo DiCaprioandJonah Hillteamed to produce the film, with Hill set to play Jewell, and DiCaprio set to play the lawyer who helped Jewell navigate the media blitz that surrounded him.[14]Paul Greengrassbegan negotiations to direct the film, withBilly Raywriting the screenplay.[15]Other directors considered includeEzra Edelman(known for the 2016 documentaryO.J.: Made in America) andDavid O. Russell,[16][17]beforeClint Eastwoodwas officially attached in early 2019. DiCaprio and Hill did not end up acting in the film, though they remained as producers.[18]
In May 2019,Warner Bros.acquired the project from20th Century Fox, which had been acquired byThe Walt Disney Companyearlier that year.[19]In June,Sam Rockwellwas cast as the lawyer, andPaul Walter Hauseras Jewell.Kathy Bates,Olivia Wilde,Jon Hamm, andIan Gomezwere also cast.[20][21][22][23][24]Nina Ariandajoined the cast in July.[25]Filming began on June 24, 2019, inAtlanta.[26]
In an interview withEllen DeGenereson hertalk show, Eastwood explained how he continued to work on the film despite a wildfire near the studio.[27]DeGeneres described the November 10 blaze, known as the Barham Brush Fire, as a "really bad fire that came really close to the lot," adding that "air quality was so bad that everyone evacuated." Eastwood replied: "I was coming back down to do some work at a sound stage and I saw all this smoke going. And I'm getting closer and closer and its Warner Bros. and its smoke and I got almost up there and I thought, the whole studio's burning down, maybe I'll go in and see if I can retrieve something. So we went on the sound stage and started working and we forgot about it and...everybody said, 'The studio's been evacuated!' And I said, 'We're not evacuated, we're here working!'"[28]
A trailer for the film was released on October 3, 2019,[29]and the film premiered atAFI Feston November 20,[30]before being theatrically released in the United States on December 13 byWarner Bros. Pictures.[31]
Richard Jewellgrossed $22.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $22.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide box office total of $44.6 million,[3][4]against a production budget of $45 million.[2]Its performance was characterized as abox office flopby several media outlets.[32][33][34][35]
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongsideJumanji: The Next LevelandBlack Christmas, and was initially projected to gross around $10 million from 2,502 theaters over its opening weekend.[36]However, after making $1.6 million on its first day, weekend estimates were lowered to $5 million,[2]and it ended up earning $4.7 million, one of the 50 worstwide openingsever.[37]It was Eastwood's worst opening weekend sinceBronco Billyin 1980, and the second-lowest opening of his career.[38]The film finished fourth at the box office, behindJumanji: The Next Level,Frozen II, andKnives Out.[39][40]
Its second weekend, the film fell 45% to $2.6 million, finishing in seventh place at the box office,[41]and its third weekend, it made $3 million (and a total of $5.4 million over the five-day Christmas weekend), finishing tenth.[42]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 77% of 301 critics' reviews of the film are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10; the site's "critics consensus" reads: "Richard Jewellsimplifies the real-life events that inspired it—yet still proves that Clint Eastwood remains a skilled filmmaker of admirable economy."[43]OnMetacriticthe film has aweighted averagescore of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 45 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[44]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.[2]
The film came under fire for its portrayal ofThe Atlanta Journal-Constitutionreporter Kathy Scruggs, who had died of a prescription drug overdose in 2001.[45]Criticism was directed at the film for depicting her as offering to engage in sex with an FBI agent in return for confidential information.[46]The editor-in-chief of theAJCwrote in an open letter stating that this depicted incident was "entirely false and malicious".[47]Employees of the newspaper demanded the film have a prominent disclaimer that "some events were imagined for dramatic purposes and artistic license."[48][49]Critical commentators argued that the film perpetuates a sexist trope of women journalists exchanging sex for information.[50][51]
Olivia Wilde, who plays Scruggs in the film, defended her role and stated there was a sexistdouble standard, in thatJon Hamm's portrayal of the FBI agent was not held to the same scrutiny.[52]In response, it was argued that Wilde's character was based on a real person, whereas the FBI agent was an amalgamation of multiple individuals,[52]and that, while the purpose of the film was to expose and condemn thecharacter assassinationof Jewell, in the process, it committed the same act against Scruggs.[50][53]

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]
Warner Bros. owns some shared universes. Some of them are based on books and comics, including some of the highest grossing IP's in the movie industry.

Malpaso ProductionsisClint Eastwood'sproduction company.[1]It was established in 1967 asThe Malpaso Companyby Eastwood's financial adviserIrving Leonardfor the filmHang 'Em High(1968), using profits from theDollars Trilogy. Leonard served as President of the Malpaso Company until his death on December 13, 1969.
The name is derived fromMalpaso Creek(Spanish for "bad step", or "misstep"), located south ofCarmel-by-the-Sea, California. Eastwood had received U.S. Army basic training at nearbyFort Ord, where he remained as a lifeguard until discharged in 1953.[2]On December 24, 1967, Eastwood bought five parcels totaling 283 acres (115 ha) of land along Malpaso Creek from Charles Sawyer.[3]He later added more land until he owned 650 acres (260 ha). The land bordered the south bank of Malpaso Creek from the eastern side of Highway 1 to the coastal ridge. He sold it to Monterey County in 1995 for $3.08 million.[4][5]Near the coast, a trail and later a road ran from Carmel to Big Sur during the 1800s. The creek has very steep side slopes and there was only one crossing (a ford only 10 feet (3.0 m) above sea level) until the Malpaso Creek Bridge was built in 1935 as part of Highway 1.
When Eastwood agreed to take the role ofThe Man with No NameinA Fistful of Dollarsin 1964, his agent told him that it would be a "bad step" for his career. TheDollars Trilogywas surprisingly successful. After filmingWhere Eagles Darein 1968, Eastwood grew annoyed about the money he considered wasted during these big productions. He wanted more creative control over his films and decided to form his own production company. He thought the choice of "Malpaso" was appropriate.[6]
Irving Leonard, Eastwood's financial adviser, organized the company for Eastwood following the success of and using the earnings from theDollars Trilogy.[7]The first feature they produced was the  1968 filmHang 'Em High. Leonard served as President of the Malpaso Company and associate producer of Eastwood's films fromHang 'Em Highuntil his death in 1969.[8][9]
Eastwood is known for very tightshooting schedules, finishing his films on schedule and on budget, or earlier and under budget, typically in much less time than most production companies.[10]
Few film production companies such as Malpaso Productions have been involved with one studio for releasing its motion pictures.Warner Bros. Pictureshas served as the distributor of many of Clint Eastwood's produced, directed and starred films, a relationship that has lasted for nearly half a century and resulted in more than 40 features.[11]

I'm not a stunning woman. I never was aningenue; I've always just been a character actor. When I was younger it was a real problem, because I was never pretty enough for the roles that other young women were being cast in. The roles I was lucky enough to get were real stretches for me: usually a character who was older, or a little weird, or whatever. And it was hard, not just for the lack of work but because you have to face up to how people are looking at you. And you think, "Well, y'know, I'm a real person."[9]
