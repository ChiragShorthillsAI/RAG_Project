After the death of Archer Monroe, the patriarch of a powerful political family, his estate is divided among his family. The beneficiaries are his wife, Catherine; his son, William, a politician running for reelection; and his daughter, Lauren, aManhattan District Attorney. The family attorney, Harold Thewlis, hands Lauren a message from her father, telling her a secret and directing her to anunderground bunkeron the family's property.
In the bunker, Lauren finds a chained man who identifies himself as Morgan Warner. Morgan tells Lauren he was Archer's friend and business partner. One night while driving drunk, they killed a pedestrian. Archer imprisoned Morgan to prevent him from exposing the incident and ruining his career.
Over the years, Archer treated Morgan like a confessor and admitted many secrets. As proof, Morgan directs Lauren to the victim's body. Lauren also finds Archer's longtime mistress, his illegitimate son, and evidence of Archer bribing to aid his children being elected to public office. Eventually Lauren frees Morgan and directs Harold to set up an offshore bank account and charter a private jet so Morgan can disappear.
Morgan's sample of his fingerprints is identified and the result is sent to the Monroe house. Catherine is shocked by the photos and identifies him as Carson, claiming he is an evil man. Lauren learns that Carson's flight never left and Harold has been murdered. Returning to the Monroe house, Lauren finds that Carson has taken Catherine to the bunker.
Carson subdues Lauren and reveals that 30 years ago, he drugged and raped Catherine. Archer was taking Carson somewhere to kill him when they hit the pedestrian. Archer changed his mind and imprisoned Carson instead. Archer's death was actually by the poison he intended to use on Carson. Lauren fights back and, during their struggle, Carson claims Lauren is his daughter. Catherine seizes his gun and shoots him dead. Lauren and Catherine set the bunker on fire and leave.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
