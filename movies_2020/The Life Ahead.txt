Grisar ofThe Forwardwas critical in his review, calling the film "treacly," "derivative," and "clichéd" when compared with the 1977 filmMadame Rosa, its "nuanced and celebrated predecessor." He calls Loren's performance "sturdy" and Ponti’s direction "capable," but describesThe Life Aheadas a "wan exercise, free of humor or verve."[11]

Loren's father refused to marry her mother,[5]leaving her without financial support. Loren met her father three times, at age five, age seventeen and in 1976 at his deathbed, stating that she forgave him but had never forgotten his abandonment of her mother.[6][7]Loren's parents had another child together, her sisterMaria, in 1938. Scicolone did not want to formally recognise Maria as his daughter. When Loren became successful, she paid her father in order to have her sister Maria take the Scicolone last name.[8]Loren has two younger paternal half-brothers, Giuliano and Giuseppe.[9]Romilda, Sofia, and Maria lived with Loren's grandmother inPozzuoli, nearNaples.[10][11]
During theSecond World War, the harbour and munitions plant in Pozzuoli was a frequent bombing target of theAllies. During one raid, as Loren ran to the shelter, she was struck byshrapneland wounded in the chin.[12]After that, the family moved to Naples, where they were taken in by distant relatives. After the war, Loren and her family returned to Pozzuoli. Loren's grandmother Luisa opened a pub in their living room, selling homemade cherry liquor.

Loren appeared in fewer movies after becoming a mother in 1968. During the next decade, most of her roles were in Italian features. During the 1970s, she was paired withRichard Burtonin the last De Sica-directed film,The Voyage(1974), and a remake of the filmBrief Encounter(1974). The film had its premiere on US television on 12 November 1974 as part of theHallmark Hall of Fameseries on NBC. In 1976, she starred inThe Cassandra Crossing.

Loren has recorded more than two dozen songs throughout her career, including a best-selling album of comedic songs withPeter Sellers; reportedly, she had to fend off his romantic advances.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
