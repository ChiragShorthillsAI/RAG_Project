In 1961Montana, retired sheriff George Blackledge lives on a ranch with his wife Margaret, their son James, James's wife Lorna and infant son Jimmy. One afternoon, Margaret sees James's horse return without him. George later finds James's body by a creek; he had fallen off his horse and broken his neck.
In 1963, Lorna marries her new boyfriend, Donnie Weboy; she is not in love with him but needs his support with Jimmy. One afternoon, while out shopping, Margaret sees Lorna, Donnie and Jimmy getting ice cream. When Jimmy drops his, Donnie forcefully grabs Jimmy's arm. When Lorna steps in, Donnie strikes her. Margaret later goes to their house to check in on them, but a neighbor reveals that they have left town. Margaret packs her bags, planning to rescue Jimmy. George reluctantly joins her.
George and Margaret speak to a sheriff who mentions a lead inForsyth, a shop owner related to the Weboys. He tells them to look inGladstone,North Dakota. George discovers that Margaret brought his revolver with her. Outside of Gladstone, they come across Peter Dragswolf, a young Native-American. He provides them with food and warmth for the evening, and suggests that they look for Bill Weboy, Donnie's uncle.
The following morning, George and Margaret meet Bill. He speaks to Donnie's mother Blanche, who says that she wants to meet the Blackledges. At her house, she appears pleasant. However, when Lorna and Jimmy arrive, she starts to make rude comments toward the Blackledges and speaks sternly toward Lorna.
The next day, George and Margaret visit Lorna at work. They plead with her to return home to Montana with Jimmy, but Lorna is worried what Donnie will do if she tries to leave. However, she is convinced to sneak out later while the Weboys are asleep.
That night, Blanche, Donnie and Bill, along with Blanche's two other sons Marvin and Elton, break into the Blackledges' motel room. When Margaret tells Blanche that Donnie struck Lorna and Jimmy, she asks Donnie if it is true, then slaps him and then Margaret to ask how hard he hit Lorna. When she orders him to hit Margaret, George grabs his gun and points it at them.
The men overpower George, then Blanche orders Donnie to chop off George's fingers with a hatchet, which he does. When they leave, Margaret takes George to the hospital. An officer later tells them that he spoke to the Weboys, who made it seem like George attacked first, as he and Margaret planned to abduct Jimmy. The officer says that Jimmy is a Weboy now and suggests they leave town.
George and Margaret start heading back to Montana, but when he is too weak to keep going, they stop by Peter's again to rest. Margaret asks George if they can move out there to be near Jimmy. He, however, wants to give up. Margaret breaks down, devastated that they have lost both James and Jimmy.
During the night, George sneaks out, returning to the Weboys'. Finding a shotgun on the back porch, he checks and replaces the shells in the gun. George sets a fire outside as a distraction, reaches Donnie and Lorna's room, and forces Donnie down at gunpoint while Lorna leaves.
Meanwhile Margaret, upon finding George gone, rushes with Peter to find him. George knocks Donnie unconscious when he tries to alert the others. Blanche wakes as he fights Bill, and Lorna tumbles down the stairs. Blanche aims her pistol at George as he gets Jimmy back but she accidentally shoots Bill dead. He then throws Jimmy over the balcony to Lorna, who catches him as Blanche shoots him in the chest.
As Marvin and Elton run upstairs, George fights Blanche for the gun and eventually causes her to shoot both of them. Margaret and Peter find Lorna and Jimmy outside. Margaret rushes in to try and get George out, but Blanche corners them and shoots George again, this time killing him. Margaret then grabs the shotgun and kills Blanche.
Peter gets Margaret out as the Weboy house goes up in flames. They later part ways, as she drives home with Lorna and Jimmy.

Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
