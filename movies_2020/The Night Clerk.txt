Bart Bromley lives with his mom and hasAsperger syndrome. He places hidden cameras in a room at the hotel where he works as a night desk clerk and uses the live feeds and recordings to overcome his social awkwardness by imitating the speech and mannerisms of the guests. On his nightly shift, Bart watches Karen, who has recently checked in. After his shift, he buys ice cream, goes home, and continues to watch Karen.
Bart sees Karen let an unknown man into her room. After they argue, the man begins to beat her. Bart watches as a gun falls from Karen's purse, then drives to the hotel to try to rescue her. He enters via a side door, and soon afterwards Bart's co-worker Jack hears a gunshot. Jack enters Karen’s room, where he finds Karen dead and Bart sitting on the bed. While Jack calls911, Bart removes the hidden cameras, but accidentally leaves a storage card behind.
The next day, Bart is questioned by Detective Espada and claims he went home after buying ice cream, then returned to the hotel because he forgot his wallet. Espada realizes Bart is lying because if he had not had his wallet, he would not have been able to buy ice cream. Bart later re-watches the recording of Karen’s room and sees that the man she met had a tattoo of a bird on his arm.
The next day, Bart's boss reassigns him to a new hotel. On his first shift, he meets Andrea Rivera, who recognizes that he has Asperger's, flirts with him, and checks into a room. The next day, Bart finds that he is missing a storage card, which Espada finds. Bart places cameras in Andrea's room and later shares a kiss with her near the hotel's pool.
The following day, Bart gets a haircut and buys a new suit, car, and cologne. He tries to visit Andrea at the hotel, only to find her having sex with the unknown man from Karen's room, whom he recognizes from the tattoo. Bart returns home and finds police have taken all his computer and camera equipment. He tells Espada his hard drives are empty because he deleted all the recordings before police arrived. After Espada leaves, Bart retrieves a hidden hard drive that contains a copy of the recording from Karen's room.
The unknown man Bart saw with Andrea is Karen’s husband Nick, a detective who has been having an affair with Andrea and wants her to kill Bart so he cannot identify Nick to police. As Bart watches the cameras in Andrea's room, he sees Nick argue with her and start to beat her. He rushes to the hotel and enters Andrea's room as Nick leaves, then shows Andrea the hidden cameras. At his house, he shows her the recording from Karen's room and Andrea sees that Nick killed Karen. Andrea begins to cry and goes to sleep in Bart’s bed. He lies down with her and falls asleep.
The following morning, Bart finds that Andrea is gone, as is the hard drive on which he had the copy of the recording from Karen's room. He also finds that Andrea has left the gun from Karen's purse on his bed. Andrea gives Nick the hard drive with the recording of Karen's room and they start to drive out of town. The police arrive at Bart's house and find that Bart is not there, but has left the gun and the camera storage cards along with a note for Espada. Nick and Andrea are pulled over and arrested. Bart walks through a local mall and practices the conversational speech and body language he has observed in his recordings.

De Armas was born inHavana, Cuba,[1]and raised inSanta Cruz del Norte.[2]Her maternal grandparents wereSpanish migrants to Cubafrom the regions ofLeónandPalencia, both in the north of Spain.[3][4]Her father Ramón had various jobs, including a bank manager, teacher, school principal and deputy mayor of a town.[5]He previously studied philosophy at a Soviet university.[5][6]Her mother Ana worked in the human resources section of the Ministry of Education.[7][8][9]De Armas has one older brother, Javier, a US–based photographer[5][10]who, in 2020, was questioned by Cuban police due to his critical stance onDecree 349and his links to artists under government surveillance.[11]While de Armas grew up withfood rationing, fuel shortages and electricity blackouts during Cuba'sSpecial Period,[5][12]she has described her early life as happy.[7]
During her childhood and adolescence, de Armas had no Internet access and had limited knowledge of popular culture beyond Cuba.[13]She was allowed to watch "20 minutes of cartoons on Saturday and the Sunday movie matinee."[14]Her family did not own a video or DVD player, and she watched Hollywood movies in her neighbor's apartment.[15]She memorized and practiced monologues in front of a mirror,[16][17]and decided to become an actress when she was 12.[18]In 2002, aged 14, she successfully auditioned to join Havana'sNational Theatre of Cuba.[7][19]She sometimes hitchhiked to attend the "rigorous" course.[20][21]While a student, she filmed three movies.[5][8]She left the four-year drama course shortly before presenting her final thesis because Cuban graduates are forbidden from leaving the country without first completing three years of mandatory service to the community.[8][22]At age 18, with Spanish citizenship through her maternal grandparents,[3][12]she moved toMadridto pursue an acting career.[8]

After first readingElinor Lipman's novel, she tried to interest numerous studios in the material, and her unsuccessful efforts led her to begin writing the screenplay and raising funds to produce it herself. Upon its release, Ruthe Stein of theSan Francisco Chronicleobserved, "You would think that frontloadingThen She Found Mewith so much plot would make it play like asoap opera. But Hunt saves the movie from this fate in two ways. First she turns in a touchingly real performance, the best of her big-screen career. Forget thatAs Good as It Getswon her anOscar.[24]She's eons better and more realistic in this one [...] By directingThen She Found Me, Helen becomes its savior as well  [...] Hunt knows when to rein in the Divine Miss M instead of allowing her to go into fullKabukimode. [She] also coaxes pitch-perfect performances from Broderick and Firth."[25]
Hunt starred in the dramedyEvery Day(2010), as one half of a married couple pulled apart by increasing responsibilities.[26]According toLos Angeles Times, the film "comes as a reminder of [Hunt's] talent for understatement, and a wish to see more of her".[27]In the biographical dramaSoul Surfer(2011), she played the mother of the Hawaiian-born champion surferBethany Hamilton, on whose life the film was based. Her firstwide releasesince 2001'sThe Curse of the Jade Scorpion,Soul Surfermade US$47.1 million internationally.[28]
Hunt starred as sex surrogateCheryl Cohen-GreeneinThe Sessions(2012), alongsideJohn HawkesandWilliam H. Macy. The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes offull-frontal nudity, on which she further said: "Being naked was challenging, but even more than that was the vulnerability. I felt vulnerable because I was naked. I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character's life. This was a real journey that someone had gone on, and I wanted to do right by that."[29]Her performance was acclaimed by critics and earned her several award nominations, including anOscarnomination forBest Supporting Actress. Todd McCarthy ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "Hunt's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure."[30]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
