Ava Faulkner is a recovering addict and former soldier turned assassin. In France, she kidnaps her new target, an English businessman. Before she kills him, she questions him on why someone wants him dead. Unbeknownst to her, another woman electronically eavesdrops on the conversation. Afterwards, Ava flies to Boston where she visits with her estranged sister Judy and her mother Bobbi who is hospitalized foranginapain. Ava has not seen them in eight years.
Ava's handler and former Army superior, Duke, sends her to Saudi Arabia to kill a German general. Ava lures the general into a trap and injects him with a poison to make it appear he died of aheart attack. Having blown her cover due to a mispronunciation of a man in her backstory, she is interrupted by the general's security guards. A gunfight ensues, leaving all the men dead.
Ava escapes and travels toBarneville-Carteretwhere Duke apologizes for the botched operation, insisting that the bad intel was a simple mistake. He gives her time off to decompress and she returns to Boston and meets Michael, her former fiancé who is now in a relationship with her sister Judy.
InBritish Columbia, Duke meets with his superior, Simon.  Simon's daughter Camille is the woman who had earlier eavesdropped on Ava's hit. Simon believes Ava is a liability and that her questioning of targets demonstrates insufficient commitment to their operation.  After Duke leaves, Simon reaffirms the hit on Ava.  She kills her attacker and then confronts Duke who insists that it was a random attack by a drug addict. That night, Ava goes to dinner with Judy and Michael (as recommended by Ava's mother to reconcile and patch up their differences), but their conversation does not go well. Judy abruptly leaves the table when witty banter between Ava and Michael ensues. Michael and Ava are left to chat for a while until Michael leaves as well, still visibly upset at Ava for being gone the past 8 years with no contact. At 5 o'clock in the morning, Ava is startled awake by knocking at her hotel door. It's Judy telling her Michael has gone missing. Realizing he has started gambling again, Ava denies knowing where he is to Judy. The next scene shows Ava going to rescue him from agambling denrun by a woman, named Toni, to whom Michael is indebted for over $80,000. A fight ensues with Toni's guards after Ava tries to leave with Michael. Ava asks Toni to give her 36 hours to clear Michael's debt and Toni, seeing her guards injured on the floor, begrudgingly agrees.
Duke revisits Simon and reveals he knew Ava was set up. A fight ensues between the two men, resulting in Simon killing Duke. He sends a video of Duke's death to Ava. A heartbroken Ava goes to Judy's house, where she invites Michael to run away with her but he declines, revealing that Judy is pregnant. Ava heads to Toni's den where she kills some of her men before giving Toni a bag of money to pay off Michael's debt. Ava starts to strangle Toni, and is about to break her neck, but then changes her mind, letting her live while warning her to stay away from Michael for good.
Back at her hotel, Ava is attacked by Simon. They fight, with both sustaining serious injuries. Exhausted, Simon flees when the fire alarm goes off, warning Ava that he will kill her if he sees her again.  Ava pursues Simon, cornering and killing him under theZakim Bridge. Ava goes to her sister's house, warning Judy to leave the country and giving her the number and code to an offshore bank account filled with Ava's earnings. Before she leaves, Michael gives her a letter from Duke, who says that he is happy with how his life turned out. As she walks down the street, Ava is stalked by Simon's daughter, Camille.
In August 2018, the production drew criticism due toMatthew Newton, who at the time was set to direct, having been accused of multiple allegations of assault and domestic violence. In addition to the accusations, he had also pleaded guilty to assaultingBrooke Satchwell, his then girlfriend.[3]Jessica Chastain, a vocal advocate for theMeToo movement, was accused of hypocrisy for working with Newton.[4]Newton would ultimately step down from directing the film, withTate Taylorhired to replace him. Newton is credited as the film's writer.[5][6][7]

The film was released in Hungary on July 2, 2020.[17]It was released in the United States throughDirecTV Cinemaon August 27, 2020, followed byvideo on demandon September 25, 2020, byVertical Entertainment.[18][19][20]It received a DVD and Blu-ray release in Australia on September 2, 2020, byMadman Entertainment.[21][22]

OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 18% based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Avaseems to have all the components of an entertaining spy thriller, but not even this spectacular cast is enough to salvage the dull, clichéd story they're given to work with."[26]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on nine critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[27]
Guy Lodge ofVarietywrote that "the film provides an adequate showcase for its producer-star's unexpected prowess as an action hero — yet Matthew Newton's skimpy, dial-a-cliché script makes the whole enterprise feel more like a mid-range series pilot than a major star vehicle."[28]Writing forThe Hollywood ReporterBoyd van Hoeij said that "Chastain is utterly convincing in another tough-as-nails role. If audiences stick with the movie, it's largely thanks to her movie-star charisma, which almost compensates for the increasingly ridiculous plot. Malkovich and Farrell seem to understand they are A-list talent in B-movie roles, and relish the opportunity."[29]
In Hungary, the film made $31,820 from 59 theaters in its opening weekend, finishing first at the box office. The film grossed a total of $3.3 million worldwide.[2]

Common was born on March 13, 1972, at the Chicago Osteopathic Hospital in Chicago'sHyde Parkneighborhood. He is the son of educator and former principal ofJohn Hope College PreparatoryHigh School, Mahalia Ann Hines, and formerABAbasketball player turned youth counselorLonnie Lynn.[15]Lynn shares the same first name as his father, grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather.[16]He is known by his middle name, Rashid, to his family and friends.[17]Lynn's godfather is basketball playerSpencer Haywoodwho was a teammate of his father on theDenver Rockets.[16]
Lynn was raised in theCalumet Heightsneighborhood.[18][19][20][21]His father left the family because of his drug and alcohol addictions while Lynn was young.[16]When he was aged two, Lynn's father attempted to take him and his mother to Seattle where he had arranged a tryout with theSeattle SuperSonics.[16]His father was arrested when the family stopped at a motel in Wisconsin and charged with false imprisonment.[22]
Lynn's parents divorced when he was six years old, resulting in his father moving toDenver, Colorado. This left Lynn to be raised by his mother; however, his father remained active in his life, and was able to get him a job with theChicago Bullsas a teenager. Lynn attendedFlorida A&M Universityfor two years under a scholarship and majored inbusiness administration.[23]
Lynn began rapping in the late 1980s, while a student atLuther High School Southin Chicago, when he, along with two of his friends, formed C.D.R., a rap trio that opened for acts such asN.W.AandBig Daddy Kane.[24]When C.D.R dissolved by 1991, Lynn began a solo career under the stage name ofCommon Sense. After being featured in theUnsigned Hypecolumn ofThe Sourcemagazine, he debuted as a solo artist in 1992 with the single "Take It EZ", followed by the albumCan I Borrow a Dollar?.
With the 1994 release ofResurrection, Common Sense achieved a much larger degree of critical acclaim which extended beyond the Chicago music scene. The album sold relatively well and received a strong positive reaction amongalternativeandunderground hip hopfans at the time.Resurrectionwas Common Sense's last album produced almost entirely by his long-time production partner,No I.D., who would later become a mentor to a youngKanye West.
In 1996, Common Sense appeared on theRed Hot Organization's compilation CD,America Is Dying Slowly(A.I.D.S.), alongsideBiz Markie,Wu-Tang Clan, andFat Joe, among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as "a masterpiece" byThe Sourcemagazine. He would later also contribute to theRed Hot Organization'sFela Kutitribute album,Red Hot and Riotin 2002. He collaborated withDjelimady Tounkaraon a remake of Kuti's track, "Years of Tears and Sorrow".
The song "I Used to Love H.E.R." fromResurrectionignited afeudwithWest Coast rap groupWestside Connection. The lyrics of the song criticized the path hip hop music was taking, utilizing a metaphor of a woman to convey hip hop[25]and were interpreted by some as directing blame towards the popularity of West Coastgangsta rap. Westside Connection first responded with the 1995 song "Westside Slaughterhouse," with the lyrics "Used to love H.E.R., mad cause I f*cked her". "Westside Slaughterhouse" also mentioned Common Sense by name, prompting the rapper to respond with the scathingPete Rock-produced attack song "The Bitch in Yoo". Common Sense and Westside Connection continued to insult each other back and forth before finally meeting withLouis Farrakhanand setting aside their dispute. Following the popularity ofResurrection, Common Sense was sued by anOrange County-basedreggaeband with thesame name, and was forced to shorten his moniker to simply Common.[26]
Initially scheduled for an October 1996 release, Common released his third album,One Day It'll All Make Sense, in September 1997. The album took a total of two years to complete and included collaborations with artists such asLauryn Hill,De La Soul,Q-Tip,Canibus,Black Thought,Chantay Savage, andQuestlove– a future fellow member of theSoulquariansoutfit. The album, which made a point of eschewing any gangsterism (in response to questions about his musical integrity), was critically acclaimed and led to amajor labelcontract withMCA Records. In addition to releasingOne Day, Common's first child, daughter Omoye Assata Lynn, was born shortly after the release of the album.
As documented by hip-hop journalist Raquel Cepeda, in the liner notes for the album, this event had a profound spiritual and mental effect on Common and enabled him to grow musically while becoming more responsible as an artist. She writes:
Common addresses family ethics several times onOne Day..., and the album sleeve is decorated with old family photos, illustrating the rapper's childhood, as well a quote from1 Corinthians 13:11, which summarizes the path to manhood:
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.
FollowingOne Day..., Common signed a major label record deal withMCA Recordsand relocated from Chicago to New York City in 1999. He began recording almost exclusively with a loose collective of musicians and artists (dubbed the "Soulquarians" by central figureQuestlove) throughout 1999, and made a few sporadic guest appearances onThe Roots'Things Fall Apart, and theRawkus Recordscompilation,Soundbombing 2.
In 2000, his fourth album,Like Water for Chocolate, was released to mass critical acclaim.Executive producedby Questlove and featuring significant contributions byJ Dilla, (who helmed every track except – "Cold Blooded", "Geto Heaven Part II", "A Song For Assata", "Pop's Rap Part 3...All My Children" & theDJ Premier-produced track "The 6th Sense"),Like Water for Chocolatetranspired to be a considerable commercial breakthrough for Common, earning the rapper his firstgoldrecord, and greatly expanding his fanbase among critics and listeners alike.
With both artists hailing from theGreat Lakes regionof the United States (Chicago and Detroit, respectively), Common andJ Dillaestablished their chemistry early on. Both became members of theSoulquarianscollective, and collaborated on numerous projects together, even placing one song, "Thelonius", on both theSlum VillagealbumFantastic, Vol. 2, and Common'sLike Water for Chocolate. As Dilla's health began to decline from the effects ofLupus Nephritis, he relocated to Los Angeles, and asked Common to make the move with him as a roommate (Dilla would later lose his battle with the rare disease).[27]
This album saw Common exploring themes (musically and lyrically), which were uncommon for a hip-hop record, as he does on the song "Time Travelin' (A Tribute To Fela)"; a homage toNigerianmusic legend, and political activistFela Kuti. The most popular single from the album "The Light" was nominated for aGrammy Award.
In 2002, Common released his fifth album,Electric Circus. The album was highly anticipated and praised by many critics for its ambitious vision. However, it was not as commercially successful as his previous album,Like Water for Chocolate, selling under 300,000 copies. An eclectic album,Electric Circusfeatured fusions of several genres such as hip hop, pop, rock, electronic, and neo-soul. The album's style tended to divide critics; some praised its ambitious vision while others criticized it for the same reason. Most of the criticism tended to revolve around the album's experimental nature; some felt Common had strayed too far from his previous sound. This was Common's second and last album for MCA, and the label's final release prior to its absorption into Geffen Records.
Around this time, Common appeared as a guest performer on singer and fellow SoulquarianBilal'sLove for Salealbum, recording a remake of the 1977Fela Kutisong "Sorrow, Tears & Blood".[28]Bilal also featured onElectric Circus, the first of many future collaborations with Common.[29]
In early 2004, Common made an appearance on fellow Chicagoan Kanye West's multi-platinum debut album,The College Dropout(on the song "Get Em High"), and announced his signing to West's then-newfound labelGOOD Music. West had been a longtime fan of Common and the two even participated in a friendly on-air MC battle, where West took jabs at his lyrical idol for "going soft" and wearing crochet pants (as he does for his appearance in the video for theMary J. Bligesong "Dance for Me"). The pair worked together on Common's next album,Be, almost entirely produced by Kanye West, with some help from Common's longtime collaboratorJames Yancey(J Dilla) – also a favorite of West. The album was released in May 2005, and performed very well, boosted by Kanye's involvement and the singles "The Corner", and "Go".Beearned Common the second gold record of his career, with sales topping out at around 800,000 copies.The Sourcemagazine gave it a near-perfect 4.5 mic rating,XXLmagazine gave it their highest rating of "XXL", and AllHipHop gave the album 4 stars. The album was also nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2006.
Following the release ofBein 2005, several mixed-race artists from the UK hip-hop scene took exception to Common's comments about interracial relationships on the song "Real People."Yungun,Doc Brownand Rising Son recorded a track over an instrumental version of "The Corner" named "Dear Common (The Corner Dub)." Common states that he has heard of the track but never actually taken the time to listen to it, and has not retaliated in song.[30]
Common's seventh LP titledFinding Foreverwas released on July 31, 2007. For this album, he continued his work withKanye West, as well as other producers such asWill.i.am,Devo Springsteen,Derrick Hodge, andKarriem Riggins, as well as the onlyJ Dilla-produced track, "So Far To Go". The album features guest spots from artists such asDwele,Bilal,D'Angelo, and UK pop starletLily Allen. The first single from the album was "The People" b/w "The Game". West predicted thatFinding Foreverwould win the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.[31]The album was nominated for Best Rap Album, but did not win, losing to West'sGraduation; however, Common did win his second Grammy for "Southside," which won the 2008 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by Duo or Group.
On July 31, 2007, Common performed a free concert in Santa Monica, California, on the 3rd Street Promenade to promote the release ofFinding Forever. Common explained to the audience that the title "Finding Forever" represented his quest to find an eternal place in hip-hop and also his wishes to be an artist for the rest of his life. The album debuted at #1 on the nationalBillboard200charts.
In an August 2007 interview withXXL, rapperQ-Tipof the groupA Tribe Called Queststated that he and Common were forming a group called 'The Standard', and were planning to record an album to be produced by Q-Tip; however, this never came to fruition.[32]
Common was instrumental in bridging the trans-Atlantic gap by signing UK's Mr. Wong and J2K to Kanye West's Getting Out Our Dreams recording outfit. Common met the pair during his tour in the UK earlier on in the year. It is speculated that the deal is not only to bring the UK and US hip hop genres together but that to rival Syco Music's cross-Atlantic success with Leona Lewis. He also has a deal with Zune mp3 players. In 2008 Common made an estimated 12 million dollars, making him equal in earnings toEminemandAkon, tied for the 13th highest grossing Hip-Hop artist.[citation needed]
The eighth album from Chicago hip-hop artist Common was originally scheduled to be released on June 24, 2008, under the nameInvincible Summer, but he announced at aTemple Universityconcert that he would change it toUniversal Mind Control.[33]The release date was pushed back to September 30, 2008, due to Common filmingWanted. The release date was set for November 11, 2008, however, it was once again pushed back to December 9, 2008.
The album'seponymouslead single"Universal Mind Control", was officially released on July 1, 2008, via the US iTunes Store as part ofThe Announcement EP(sold asUniversal Mind Control EPin the UK). The song features Pharrell, who also produced the track.The Announcement EPincluded an additional track titled "Announcement", also featuring Pharrell. The video for the lead single was filmed in September by director Hype Williams. In 2009, Common was prominently featured throughout his GOOD Music label-mateKid Cudi's debut albumMan on the Moon: The End of Day, as a narrator and featured artist. In late 2009, it was revealed Common was nominated for twoGrammysat the52nd Annual Grammy Awards, includingBest Rap Performance by a Duo or Groupfor "Make Her Say", alongside Kid Cudi and Kanye West, as well asBest Rap AlbumforUniversal Mind Control.
American producerNo I.D., stated that he andKanye Westwould be producing Common's albumThe Dreamer/The Believer.[34]In July 2011, it was announced that No I.D. would be the album's sole producer.[35]Common made an appearance onThe Jonas Brothers' most recent album,Lines, Vines and Trying Timesas a guest rapper for the group's 2009 song, "Don't Charge Me for the Crime."[36]
On July 6, 2011, Common released his first single, titled "Ghetto Dreams", from his next album. A second single, "Blue Sky", was released on October 4, 2011. On December 20, 2011, Common released his ninth solo album, titledThe Dreamer, The Believer. Although he left GOOD Music in 2011, Common was featured on the label's first compilation album, 2012'sCruel Summer. Common released a song entitled "Sweet", fromThe Dreamer/The Believer, which included lyrics critical of rappers who sing, although this criticism was not aimed specifically at Canadian recording artistDrake.[37]Drake took offense and responded by releasing "Stay Schemin'", a song withRick RossandFrench Montana.[38]Common fans only had to wait two-and-a-half days for him to respond to Drake'sdiss track. On February 13, 2012, Common commented on the feud by saying "It's over. But it was all in the art of hip hop. He said some things to me so I had to say some things back...I wouldn't say [he started it] but I know I heard something that I felt was directed to me so I addressed it. That's all. But you know, thank God we were able to move forward from it and all is good."[39]
After a quiet 2012, Common announced he would release anextended play(EP) in January 2013, and his firstmixtapein April.[40]In February 2013, Common announced his tenth solo studio album would be released in September 2013 and will featureKanye Westand production from Kanye West andNo I.D.[40]Later on September 8, 2013, he gave an update to his projects saying the previously announced EP would be released soon, and would feature a song with new Def Jam signeeVince Staples.

The album, which Common revealed was originally going to be an EP, is set to featureVince Staples,James Fauntleroyand "some new artists from Chicago." The concept of the album was inspired by his troubled hometown of Chicago: "We came up with this concept 'nobody's smiling.' It was really a thought that came about because of all the violence in Chicago," he says. "It happens in Chicago, but it's happening around the world in many ways." He continues, "We was talking about the conditions of what's happening, when I say 'nobody's smiling.' But it's really a call to action."[42][43][44]On June 4, 2014, it was announced Common signed a recording contract withDef Jam Recordingsand No I.D.'s Artium Records.[45]It was also announcedNobody's Smilingwould be released July 22, 2014.[45]Lonnie "Pops" Lynn was to be featured on this album as well but the recording fell through as Lonnie's health declined.

Then, in January, we were oppositeAmerican Idol. They said, 'The ratings are going to suffer, so we should take you off the air for the entire run ofIdol, and bring it back in May. I put a lot of time and effort into getting it on another network, too, but it didn't work".[32]Her performance in the series earned her theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama, in addition to nominations for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Seriesand theScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
