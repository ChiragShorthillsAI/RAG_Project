Jeronicus celebrates Christmas with his family, leaving Diego and the store under the care of his apprentice Gustafson. Diego becomes distraught upon learning he will be mass-produced, thus robbing him of his uniqueness. He talks aspiring inventor Gustafson into getting back at Jeronicus by taking Diego and his book of inventions.
Without proof of Gustafson's actions to show to the police, Jangles and Things falls into financial hardship while Gustafson starts his own factory. After his wife Joanne's death, Jeronicus grows distant from his daughter Jessica, who moves away.
30 years later, Jangles and Things is a failing pawnbroker shop and Jeronicus has completely lost his creative spark. He is visited by postwoman Ms. Johnston, both sympathetic and smitten with him, who tries to lift his spirits. Jeronicus is visited by banker Mr. Delacroix who warns him to pay his debts or produce a new invention to show to the bank by Christmas or lose his shop.
Meanwhile, Jessica is shown to have a daughter named Journey who shares Jeronicus’ passion for inventing. A letter arrives for Jessica from Jeronicus, so she sends Journey to stay with him until Christmas. Upon arriving, Jeronicus seems uninterested in her, though agrees to let her stay.
Gustafson, now a famous toy tycoon, has exhausted all inventions from Jeronicus’ book. At a party, he unveils a toy of his own design that he has been trying to perfect called the Twirly Whirly, which malfunctions and attacks one of the guests. Diego convinces Gustafson to steal another invention from Jeronicus.
Jeronicus is busy working on his next toy, The Buddy 3000, which Journey discovers was conceived and designed by Jessica, and she resolves to get it to work. That night, Journey is caught in Jeronicus’ workshop by his assistant Edison. Together, they find Buddy's body in Jeronicus’ workshop, and after putting in the mechanism that Jeronicus was working on, Buddy comes to life. Jeronicus hears the commotion and enters, causing Buddy to shut down. After sending Journey to bed, he laments about his estrangement from his daughter, the loss of his wife, and the memories with them.
Journey and Edison later discover Buddy has been stolen by Gustafson. They sneak into his factory, where his unveiling of Buddy fails. Gustafson orders Buddy destroyed, though Journey and Edison retrieve it in time.
After realizing Journey and Edison have gone missing, Jeronicus goes to the factory. With help from Jeronicus and Buddy, Journey and Edison are able to escape the factory, though Buddy is severely damaged in the process. Ms. Johnston arrives to help them escape Gustafson and his guards.
Journey reveals to Jeronicus that she wrote to Jessica on his behalf, wanting to get to know him. He gets to work on fixing Buddy. to do right by Journey and Jessica, who arrives in town to retrieve Journey. Jessica confronts Jeronicus over his neglect of her, though he unveils hundreds of letters he wrote her but could not bring himself to send. After making amends, Jessica helps Jeronicus fix Buddy overnight.
Jeronicus and his family are confronted by Gustafson, Diego, and the police, and accused of stealing Buddy from him, though Journey disproves this. Jeronicus removes the life-giving component from Diego for reprogramming. As Gustafson is arrested, Jeronicus gives Gustafson the missing component for his Twirly he wrapped to give him years back, if only he had been patient. Mr. Delacroix arrives in the store and sees Buddy, and promises to give Jeronicus funding for any invention he desires to make.

Enrique Martin Morales was born on December 24, 1971, inSan Juan, Puerto Rico.[1][2][3]His mother, Doña Nereida Morales, is a former accountant; his father, Enrique Martín Negroni, is a former psychologist who previously worked as a regional supervisor for a Puerto Rican mental-health agency.[4][5]His parents divorced when he was two years old, and although his mother hadcustodyof Martin, he could also move freely between his father's house in the middle-class suburb of University Gardens in San Juan, and his paternal grandmother's house nearby. In an interview withPeople, he told the magazine that he "never had to make decisions" about who he loved more, and he was "always happy". Martin has two older maternal half-brothers, Fernando and Ángel Fernández, two younger paternal half-brothers, Eric and Daniel Martín, and a younger paternal half-sister, Vanessa Martín.[5][6]Martin has Spanish heritage ofBasqueandCanariandescent. As he explained toABC, the paternal Martins traveled fromSegovia, Spain to Puerto Rico in 1779.[7][8]He also has someCorsicanorigins through his paternal grandmother.[9]
Martin grew upCatholic. The people closest to him called him "Kiki" (a nickname that comes from Enrique). He began singing at age six, using wooden kitchen spoons as make-believe microphones; he often sang songs by Puerto Rican boy bandMenudo, as well as English-language rock groups such asLed Zeppelin,Journey, andREO Speedwagon. His mother's side of the family was musically inclined and his maternal grandfather was a poet. Martin later reflected on his time spent with his family as a child: "Every time I find myself in front of an audience, be it twenty people or one hundred thousand, once again I feel the energy that consumed me back at the family gatherings of my youth." He attended Colegio Sagrado Corazón, a bilingual Catholic grade school in University Gardens since fourth grade and was an "average" student there. When he was nine years old, he began appearing in television commercials for products such as soft drinks, toothpaste, and fast food restaurants, includingOrange CrushandBurger King. In a year and a half, he starred in 11 commercials.[5][9][10]
After achieving moderate fame in Puerto Rico for his appearances in television commercials, Martin auditioned for membership in Menudo. Formed in Puerto Rico in 1977, Menudo members were usually replaced when they hit 16 to keep the band "full of fresh-faced members".[11]Although the executives enjoyed his dancing and singing at his first two auditions, Martin was rejected because he was too short. By the third audition, his persistence impressed executives, and in 1984, 12-year-old Martin became a member. He replaced memberRicky Melendezat Menudo. A month after joining Menudo, he made his debut performance with the group at theLuis A. Ferré Performing Arts Centerin San Juan (he had previously sung at a Menudo concert, at Ricky Melendez's last concert as a member of the band on September 16, 1984). During this performance, he inadvertently disobeyed the choreography by walking around the stage, when it was planned that he would stay still, and was chastised by the band manager after the show: "The mistake was such a big deal that from that moment on, never again did I move when I wasn't supposed to move. That was the discipline of Menudo: You either did things the way you were told or you were not part of the group." Although Martin enjoyed traveling and performing onstage with Menudo, he found the band's busy schedule and strict management exhausting, and later reflected that the experience "cost" him his childhood. Despite this, Martin acknowledged his "opportunity to have so many amazing experiences with so many amazing people" during his time with the group.[9]
During his time with Menudo, he became a "key-member of the group" and a "fan-favorite",[11]while the band released 11 albums,[12]including theGrammy-nominatedEvolución(‹See RfD›transl.Evolution) (1984) and their highest-charting and longest-running album on the USBillboard200,Menudo(1985).[13][14]The former featured Martin's debut single, "Rayo de Luna" (‹See RfD›transl."Moonlight") and the latter included the hit single "Hold Me".[15][16]"Hold Me" became the group's first and only entry on the USBillboardHot 100chart, peaking at number 62.[17]It was ranked among the "100 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time" byBillboard,[18]the "75 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time" byRolling Stone,[19]and the "30 Best Boy Band Songs" byComplex.[16]Besides the musical career, Martin appeared with other members of Menudo in the Americanromantic comedy/drama television series,The Love Boat(1985),[20]and the Argentine soap opera,Por Siempre Amigos(1987).[21]He also developed an interest in philanthropy when the group becameUNICEFambassadors.[9]
Finally, Martin left the band in July 1989, at age 17, hoping to rest and evaluate his career path;[9]he stayed a few extra months after his "age-mandated retirement" came around.[20]He performed his final show with the group at the same venue where he had performed his first performance as a member.[9]Martin returned to Puerto Rico to "get a break from the pressures of the group, the promotional tours, and the constant stress of work." He graduated from high school, and 13 days after turning 18, he moved to New York City to celebrate his financial independence; since he was a minor during his time with Menudo, Martin was not allowed to access his own bank accounts.[9]
Martin was accepted intoNew York University'sTisch School of the Artsin 1990, but before classes began, his friend invited him to Mexico City. He attended the musical comedy play,Mama Ama el Rock(‹See RfD›transl.Mom Loves Rock) there, and was offered to stay and replace one of the actors. He accepted the offer, dropped out of university and moved from New York to Mexico City to perform in the play. While he was performing onstage inMama Ama el Rock, a producer in the audience took notice of Martin's acting and offered him a role in the MexicantelenovelaAlcanzar una estrella(‹See RfD›transl.To reach a star) (1990). Martin also joined the cast for the second season of the show, titledAlcanzar una estrella II(1991). A film based on the TV series, titledMás que alcanzar una estrella(‹See RfD›transl.More than reaching for a star) (1992), was also produced in which Martin starred, and earned him anEl Heraldo Awardfor his role.[9]
"I was so excited about getting back into the music world that I didn't care what the conditions were. All of the hard work and passion I had exerted was finally now starting to come to fruition, and music came back to my life powerfully and definitively."
ASony Discosexecutive noticed Martin's acting in the soap operas and offered him his first solo music recording contract. Eager to record his first solo album and hustled by the executive, Martin signed the contract without reading its conditions and inadvertently signed a deal in which he would only be paid one cent for each album sold. Despite viewing the contract as unfair, Martin referred to the record as "the start of something phenomenal" for him. After working "around the clock" to finish filmingAlcanzar una estrella IIand recording music,[9]he released his debut solo album,Ricky Martin, on November 26, 1991.[22]The album peaked at number five on the USBillboardLatin Pop Albumschart and spent a total of 41 weeks on the list.[23]It sold over 500,000 copies worldwide,[24]was certified gold in several countries,[25]and spawned his first solo hit singles, "Fuego Contra Fuego" (‹See RfD›transl."Fire Against Fire"), "El Amor de Mi Vida" (‹See RfD›transl."The Love of My Life"), and "Dime Que Me Quieres" (‹See RfD›transl."Tell Me You Love Me").[22]Both "Fuego Contra Fuego" and "El Amor de Mi Vida" reached the top 10 on the USBillboardHot Latin Tracks.[26]To promote the album, Martin embarked on a successful Latin American tour, breaking box office records,[25]which the singer referred to as "an indescribable feeling, almost like coming home".[9]
After the success ofRicky Martinand its subsequent tour, Martin's record company met him with the Spanish musicianJuan Carlos Calderónto work on his second studio album,Me Amaras(‹See RfD›transl.You'll Love Me) (1993). Although Martin felt "very grateful" for the opportunity to work with Calderón, he noted, "I always felt that that record was more his than mine."[9]The album sold over one million copies worldwide and was certified triple-platinum in Chile.[27][28]
During 1993, Martin suffered two harrowing incidents: he was injured in a car accident and also almost got involved in a plane crash, when a plane that flew him toSan Diego, Californiafor an interview, crashed right after dropping him off.[29]
In 1994, Martin's agent encouraged him to move to Los Angeles to act in an American sitcom calledGetting By. The show was canceled after two seasons, but soon afterward, Martin was given the role of Miguel Morez on the popular hit soap operaGeneral Hospital; Morez, a bartender and singer, known for his long and flowing hair, was a Puerto Rican citizen hiding in the United States from his lover'scriminal mastermindfather and created alove trianglewith his fiancé Lily Rivera and Brenda. Martin portrayed the role for two years and gained huge popularity and stardom, becoming "one of the most-talked about actors on the soap opera". Despite this, Martin felt he lacked chemistry with the rest of theGeneral Hospitalcast and observed that people treated him differently because of his Puerto Rican accent. At the time, it was relatively uncommon for Latin actors to appear on American television, and people suggested that he take accent reduction classes, which he refused.[9][30][31]
In 1995, Martin refocused on his music career, and began working on his third studio album,A Medio Vivir(‹See RfD›transl.Half Alive).[9]The album was released in September 1995,[32]and became a huge success; it sold over three million copies worldwide.[33]being certified gold in the United States,[34]platinum in France,[35]4× platinum in Spain,[36]as well as many other certifications in Latin American countries.[25][37]It spawned several successful hits, including "Te Extraño, Te Olvido, Te Amo" (‹See RfD›transl."I Miss You, I Forget You, I Love You"), "María", and "Volverás" (‹See RfD›transl."You Will Come Back").[30]On "María", which was released as the second single from the album,[27]Martin allowed himself "to go into a veryLatin,Africansound". He created a mix of different Latin music genres instead of singing a romanticballad, the style that he focused on it in his first two albums, whileLatin popmusic in general was mainly made up of it at the time. Although Martin was satisfied with the track and he describes it as a song that he is "extremely proud of", the first time he played it for a record label executive, the man said: "Are you crazy?

As a child, Martin used to sing songs by Menudo and rock bands such asLed Zeppelin,Journey, andREO Speedwagon, which were what his "older siblings were listening to at the time".

Considered to be a versatile artist,[200][201]Martin describes his music asLatin pop, saying: "When you say 'Latin pop', the spectrum is so broad, It's inevitable to not be influenced by everything that's happening in the industry, but always keeping your identity firm by knowing who you are."[196]He has also described his music as fusion, while noting that he does not "ride the waves that are in fashion at the moment".[202][203]Martin sings in Spanish, English, Portuguese, Italian, and French.[204]About his lyrics, Martin has emphasized that although his music will always make the listener dance, it does not mean his lyrics "have to be meaningless" and he sings about love and heartbreak, as well as "things that are good for a society", such as "freedom, freedom of expression, and social justice".[197][203]He has also declared that as a Latino, he is not afraid of sexuality and sings about sexuality and sensuality, bringing his culture with him onstage.[205]

In August 2008, Martin became a father to twin boys named Matteo and Valentino, born viagestational surrogacy. He explained that he chose surrogacy to become a parent for being "intriguing and faster" than adoption, which was complicated and could take a long time.[248][249]In March 2010, Martin publiclycame outas gay via a message on his website, stating: "I am proud to say that I am a fortunate homosexual man. I am very blessed to be who I am."[250]In an interview withVanity Fair, he declared: "There was love, passion. I do not regret anything, any of the relationships I lived, they taught me a lot, both men and women."[251]Martin also toldFama!: "I know that I like both men and women, I'm against sexual labels, we are simply human beings with emotional and sexual needs.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
