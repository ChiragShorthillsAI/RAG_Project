Bang was born inOdenseon the Danish island ofFunen. After his parents' divorce, he mostly lived with his father and moved home frequently; he ended up attending several different schools while growing up.[1][2][3]During his third year of high school, Bang participated in the musicalHairwhich sparked his interest in acting, and after he left school, he continued to do amateur theatre. At the age of 23, he made an application to theDanish National School of Theatreafter discovering that the age limit for applying is 25. He was unsuccessful but applied again the next year and was accepted five days before his 25th birthday. He attended the school in 1992 and graduated with a diploma in 1996.[2][1][4]His first theatre role after graduation was at Børneteatret Skægspire in the playTudseakvariet, and he received his first breakthrough role in the Danish 1997 television showTaxa.[5]He has worked mainly on stage and television in Denmark.
From 2001 to 2004, he was a permanent member of the cast atAalborg Teater. In 2002, he asked the theatre director for permission to perform a monologue calledOndskaben, which is based onJan Guillou's novelEvil. After leaving the theatre in 2004, Bang bought the rights to the work so he could perform the monologue at other theatres. He has performed the monologue almost 400 times, including an English language version in Denmark, Sweden, the UK, Germany, and South Africa.[6][2][7][8]
Bang starred in numerous Danish television series and films early in his career. From 2006 to 2008, he gained wide recognition (particularly in Germany) for his role in the Danish police dramaAnna Pihl.[2]He subsequently starred in several German language roles both on television (Küstenwache,SOKO Wismar,Notruf Hafenkante,Sibel & Max, andCologne P.D.) and in film (Jungle Child,Rettet Raffi!,Alle unter einer Tanne, andÜberleben an der Scheidungsfront).

In November 2018, Bang was cast to playCount Draculain theBBCmini-seriesDracula,created by the film-makers involved inSherlock.[11]In an interview forThe Guardian, it was observed that, while "sexy" and "insatiable", it is also "a very witty performance" from Bang.[12]

In 2015, he released the single "Still of the Night", featuringCharlotte Munck, his co-star in the Danish police dramaAnna Pihl. While filmingThe Square, Bang discovered that co-star and musicianMarina Schiptjenkoshared the same taste in music, so he showed her some of his music and sent her a few demos. Once filming finished, they recorded five songs together in his home studio inCopenhagen.[25]So far, the duo has released "Who Am I", "I Don't Care" and "Here We Go".
Bang met stylist and photographer Lis Louis-Jensen in 2006 while they were both working on the playDen grønne elevatorat Kanonhalløj.[30]Louis-Jensen proposed to Bang on New Year's Eve 2007, and they got married on 25 September 2010 on a canal boat in Copenhagen.[29][31]Bang is stepfather to Lis' two children, Sarah and Bella.[32][33][34]The pair have lived together inFrederiksberg, Copenhagen since 2008.[35]

The long list of Sutherland's roles and accomplishments shows a man who understood emotion well. But it's this marriage of suspicion and empathy, human feeling and the fear of humanity gone wrong, that secured his place in acting history and made him an uncommon kind of star. He didn't disappear into a role, not exactly; he was too distinctive for that. More often, the role disappeared into him, and the result was something unforgettable".
Helen Mirrennamed Sutherland as "one of the smartest actors I ever worked with. He had a wonderful enquiring brain and a great knowledge of a wide variety of subjects. He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity, and with seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became."[156]David Oyelowo, who worked with Sutherland on what became his final performance inLawmen: Bass Reeves,stated that "Given the iconic status he rightly achieved, having a front row seat to Donald Sutherland's last onscreen performance was both a privilege and clear evidence to me of his deep passion for the craft of acting. The glint in his eye was that of an inquisitive, hungry artist still on the hunt for the truth. Seeing that glint, up close, in the eyes of a legend was something to behold."[157]Jane Fonda, who worked with Sutherland on the 1971 filmKlute, wrote: "Donald was a brilliant actor and a complex man who shared quite a few adventures with me, such as theFTA Show, an anti-Vietnam war tour that performed for 60,000 active duty soldiers, sailors, and marines in Hawaii, Okinawa, the Philippines, and Japan in 1971. I am heartbroken."[158]
Sutherland'sBBCobituary says that the "late Donald Sutherland cast a literal and figurative shadow over his industry for almost 50 years".[159]The Guardian'sPeter Bradshawwrote that "Sutherland was an utterly unique actor and irreplaceable star" and "was an aristocrat of screen actors".[160]Variety'sOwen Gleibermanwrote that "in 1970, Donald Sutherland ... was the coolest movie star on the planet. The moment I saw him in "MASH," I knew he was the person I wanted to be, the same way that I wanted to beMick JaggerorSteve McQueen".[161]Canadian Prime MinisterJustin Trudeaustated, "He was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft, and truly a great Canadian artist and he will be deeply missed."[162]
Over his career he receivednumerous accoladesincluding aPrimetime Emmy Award, aGolden Globe Award, and anAcademy Honorary Award.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
