Awild mustangnarrates her life from birth, born free within theOnaqui MountainsofUtah. She explains that her mother taught that when horses pass away, they fly into the sky to rest among the stars. One day, the mustang draws the attention of some cowboys, who wrangle her herd; she never sees her mother again. A horse trainer named John Manly purchases the mustang and takes her to Birtwick, a horse sanctuary. While she likes John, the mustang refuses to cooperate, but John remains patient. The mustang befriends two other horses named Ginger and Merrylegs.
John is informed that his sister and her husband died in a car accident, leaving him to care for his niece, Jo Green. Jo wants nothing to do with John but becomes entranced with the difficult mustang. Eventually, the mustang recognizes Jo's pain as similar to her own, and they connect. Jo tames the mustang and names her Black Beauty, or Beauty for short. John gets through to Jo by having her work in the stables and tend to Beauty. They popularize the phrase "partnering" a horse as opposed to "breaking" a horse. John informs Jo that they will eventually have to sell Beauty, but Jo refuses.
During a bond between her and Jo, the latter grieves over her family while Beauty narrates that she hated seeing Jo upset but since Jo was unable to gallop, she decided to give Jo a ride across the stable. Suddenly, Jo begins to ride Beauty, John reacts in shock when James reports to John and Henry Gordon, thinking that Beauty escaped. In the slow-motion, Jo can feel the wind in her mane (which is her hair), it would help her to heal. Jo smiles as she rode for the first time until she fall off and landed on haystack. John comes to her aid, but Jo laughed and says it's fun. With that, John trained Jo to ride Beauty. Afterwards, Jo rides to the beach with Beauty, where she spread out her arms and she and Beauty were one.
One night, a fire breaks out when a stablehand doesn't turn off a heater, and the horses are evacuated. With Birtwick losing money, Jo is concerned that Beauty will be sold but works out a deal with Henry, so that she can work extra to earn the money to buy Beauty. The upperclass Winthorp family who are migrants fromEnglandarrive to purchase horses for their estate with the daughter Georgina immediately choosing Beauty to be leased. John convinces them to have Jo come along as her tenant. At the Earlshall estate, Beauty learns that her friend Ginger was purchased for the Winthorp's son George, who unlike Georgina, is kind and takes an interest in Jo.
Georgina is cruel and rude to Beauty, who resists the urge to harm her as it would get her and Jo in trouble. A race is held at a social gathering where Georgina's poor riding results in Beauty injuring a leg. George stands up to his mother, and the Winthorps return Beauty. However, John informs Jo that Birtwick is closing and all the horses have to be sold. Beauty is taken away without Jo getting a chance to say goodbye. She becomes determined to find and buy her again.
Beauty is sold to a ranger named Terry, and they go on rescue missions in the wilderness. Eventually Terry retires, and Beauty is given to a farmer who uses old tools, forcing her to work harder. Then she is sold to a kind carriage driver in New York City whose daughter names her Lady. One night, Beauty is reunited with Ginger, who had been sold without George's knowledge, but she dies shortly afterwards.
When Jerry gets sick, Beauty is sold to another carriage company, which treats its horses cruelly and engages in illegal horse trading. While out driving, Beauty spots Ginger's body being taken away. Heartbroken, Beauty sits on the road during her carriage rotation, which draws media attention. The company attempts to sell Beauty, but a kind stable boy named Manuel alerts the police of the company's illegal activities. Jo finds Beauty and reunites with her. Jo reveals that she has rebuilt Birtwick and works with John and George, now her husband, to rehabilitate horses; she even finds that Merrylegs was also recovered. Beauty lives with Jo for the rest of her days.

Beauty's mother Duchess, is portrayed by a horse named Beauty. Ginger was portrayed by Susie and Orion. Merrylegs was portrayed by Lulu Belle and Victoria.

This location was chosen for its unique and unspoiled environment, which aligns with the film's themes of freedom and the wild spirit of horses. Director Ashley Avis specifically mentioned using this location for key drone shots and stunt scenes, highlighting the beauty and ethereal quality of the beach at Springfontein.[4][5]
In July 2020,Walt Disney Picturesacquired distribution rights to the film fromConstantin Film.[6]Black Beautywas released digitally onDisney+on November 27, 2020.[7]
On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 48% based on 46 reviews, with a mixed-to-positive rating of 5.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Unable to rein in the complexities of its source material,Black Beautystruggles to gallop out of the paddock."[8]OnMetacritic, it has aweighted average scoreof 52 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[9]
Fionnuala Halligan ofScreen Dailyfound the movie to be a solid reinterpretation of Anna Sewell's novel, complimented the performances of the actors, and praised the chemistry between Kate Winslet and Mackenzie Foy's characters, saying, "Like Anna Sewell's original novel, this film's heart is very much in the right place."[10]Amy Amatangelo ofPasterated the film 7.8 out of 10, saying, "The movie looks stunning with sweeping landscapes and gorgeous shots of Beauty in action, as South Africa makes a lovely stand-in for both the American West and New York. An inspiring movie for young, old and everyone in between, I would be shocked if the movie's final moments didn't lead to a cathartic cry for every viewer. The beauty of this story is timeless."[11]Jennifer Green ofCommon Sense Mediarated the movie 3 out of 5 stars, praised the depiction of positive messages and role models, writing, "Black Beautyis emotionally taxing, with the central horse suffering abuse, loss, and danger. - That said, the film, told mostly from the horse's perspective, ultimately shows a clear respect and admiration for the animals, and it conveys positive messages of loyalty, family, perseverance, resilience."[12]
Kayti Burt ofDen of Geekrated the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars, praised Ashley Avis' direction, writing, "Ashley Avis hits all the plot points and throws in some fantastically pretty shots in the process, yet there is a lack of texture (both visually and narratively) that keeps this film from graduating from serviceable horse-girl film to something greater both within and outside the limits of Horse Girl Canon" and that the movie "lacks the thematic ambition of its source material, but is a serviceable addition to Horse Girl Canon."[13]Sara Stewart of theNew York Postrated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, writing, "One of the purposes of the book was to shine a line on animal cruelty, which is admirable — butBlack Beautyveers so often into the dark and the sad I question how much appeal it'll really have for the younger set. Still, if your tear ducts need cleaning, this is one holiday film that'll get the job done."[14]Monica Castillo ofRogerEbert.comrated the movie 2 out of 4 stars, claiming, "Avis' film clearly adores its four-legged subjects. Through David Procter's cinematography, she recreates the look and feel of one of Disney's nature documentaries for the first moments ofBlack Beauty's life. It's a golden-hour, idealized look at a herd of horses galloping through fields and in the shadows of mountains. [...] It's a narrative choice that may work better for some than others, and it probably won't ride well with devotees of the book."[15]

Constantin FilmverleihGmbHwas founded in West Germany on 1 April 1950 byPreben PhilipsenandWaldfried Barthel[de], who would later become the head of publicity for the company. It was originally the country's national distributor of films produced byColumbia PicturesandUnited Artists. Throughout the 1950s, Constantin distributed both popular and art-house films from several nations as well as medium-budgeted domestic films.
Constantin's popularity grew through the late 1950s to the 1960s by not only distributing popular films but creating its own in-house talent roster of contract players (Joachim Fuchsberger,Heinz Drache), directors and producers (Wolf C. Hartwig), as well as co-financinginternational co-productionfilms shot in Italy, such as theClint Eastwood spaghetti westerns, the films ofHarry Alan Towersand others using their own stable of stars. Constantin also had great success with theirJerry Cottonfilm series,[15]: 82–87though projected film series ofSherlock Holmes,Jules MaigretandPerry Rhodanonly had one entry.
Constantin Filmverleih was renamed toConstantin Film GmbHon 21 September 1964, and on 1 July 1965,Bertelsmann Publishingbecame the majority shareholder of Constantin. They attempted to increase output without increasing investment that resulted in the demise of many of the studio's popular film series, investment in sex films, and a stronger emphasis on releasing films from other nations rather than shooting their own. Bertelsmann sold its shares in 1969.[15]: 86–87The "old" Constantin Film GmbH was eventually declared bankrupt in October 1977.[16]
Founded in 1979 byBernd Eichinger, with Bernd Schaefers,[17]asNeue Constantin Filmafter acquiring the assets of the bankrupt "old" Constantin Film GmbH the previous year, Constantin Film developed into the first German film distributor with its own production company in just six years, with production activities extending to the international market.

Eichinger retained one of the company's leading executives and a major shareholder to his death in 2011.[18]

In September 1999, the company then went public on the German stock market asConstantin Film AG. Deutsche Börse placed the Constantin Film share on the selection index Nemax 50 in March 2000. In 2000, the company partnered with American producerPropaganda Filmsto start ProCon Films, the venture was quickly dissolved in October 2001.[19][20]

KG and from diversified holdings for the first time in 2002. In 2003, the board of Constantin Film AG embarked on a new strategic path for the company: the traditional business areas of production and distribution were expanded to include the three areas of license trading, home entertainment exploitation and increased TV service production (especially TV entertainment). Constantin Film AG also acquired 61 percent of the shares in KirchMedia Entertainment GmbH (now renamed Constantin Entertainment GmbH), one of the market leaders in German show and entertainment production. The stake was increased to 100 percent in 2005.
At the end of 2009, the listing of Constantin Film AG expired; all the shares were transferred to Highlight Communications after a squeeze-out. As of 7 October 2009, Constantin Film is no longer listed at theFrankfurter Börse.
