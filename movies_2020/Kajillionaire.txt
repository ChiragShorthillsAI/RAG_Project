Old Dolio Dyne, an emotionally stunted 26-year-old woman, is in a manipulative relationship with hercon artistparents. They treat her as an accomplice to their petty thefts and scams rather than as a daughter. The family owes $1,500 of back rent on their apartment inLos Angeles, which is actually a leaking office space attached to a soap factory.
Old Dolio concocts a scam in which they fly toNYCusing tickets they won in a contest. Her parents will take her luggage at the baggage claim and she will claim the airline has lost it. Old Dolio will then collect on thetravel insuranceshe purchased, which will cover their rent.
After an uneventful trip, Old Dolio and her parents return home. She is surprised to find them chatting with Melanie, a friendly young woman in the seat next to them. Then she is even more surprised when they reveal their scam to Melanie and have her pretend to be their daughter as they pick up the luggage. Old Dolio reports her "lost luggage", but learns it could take six weeks for the check to come, so the family looks for alternative methods to obtain the money.
Melanie proves surprisingly amenable to their way of life and reveals she lied about being a physician's assistant and is actually a clerk at an eyeglass store. She introduces the family to one of her elderly clients, from whom they steal a blank check and cash it for $650.
A second client, who is dying, asks the family to pretend to be his family as he passes away. Old Dolio is shaken by the experience and hurt when her parents rush to comfort Melanie while ignoring her. Arriving home, Old Dolio finds the insurance check in the mail.
Old Dolio's parents try to initiate athreesomewith Melanie, but she reacts badly. They are interrupted by Old Dolio, who is heartbroken to hear her mother call Melanie "hon" and offers her mother the entire travel insurance money to do the same to her.
Old Dolio's mother refuses, but Melanie accepts Old Dolio's offer and takes her to her apartment. Rather than simply call her "hon", Melanie offers a "full-service" treatment, fulfilling emotional needs that Old Dolio's parents failed to meet.
Old Dolio's parents turn up at Melanie's apartment, telling Old Dolio they love and miss her and giving her 17 birthday presents, promising the 18th one (though she is 26) at dinner the next night. She and Melanie show up to the restaurant, although they suspect it is another scam.
Old Dolio's parents give her a necklace and swear they will change. They return to Melanie's apartment and tuck Old Dolio into bed. Melanie, who has hidden the insurance money in her fuse box, tells her that if her parents steal the money they are monsters and do not love her. While Old Dolio says if the money is still there, it is proof her parents have changed. She also comes up with a third possibility: that her parents will have left behind $525, her share of the cash, signifying that they love her but will never ever be able to offer her anything more. To Melanie and Old Dolio's surprise, the cash is all there.
The next morning, Melanie and Old Dolio awaken to find that Melanie has been robbed; all removable objects and furnishings, including the cash in the fuse box, are gone. The only things left are Old Dolio's 17 presents. Realizing they are refundable, Old Dolio and Melanie take them to be returned.
The total refund is $485.05, until Melanie realizes they forgot to return the necklace, bringing the total to $525, Old Dolio's share of the insurance money. Old Dolio and Melanie kiss in the store.

Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Miranda July(bornMiranda Jennifer Grossinger; February 15, 1974) is an American film director, screenwriter, actress and author. Her body of work includes film, fiction, monologue, digital presentations and live performance art.
She wrote, directed and starred in the filmsMe and You and Everyone We Know(2005) andThe Future(2011) and wrote and directedKajillionaire(2020). She has authored a book of short stories,No One Belongs Here More Than You(2007); a collection of nonfiction short stories,It Chooses You(2011); and the novelsThe First Bad Man(2015) andAll Fours(2024).
July was born inBarre, Vermont, in 1974,[1]the daughter of Lindy Hough andRichard Grossinger. Her parents are both writers who taught atGoddard Collegeat the time.[2]They were also the founders ofNorth Atlantic Books, a publisher of alternative health, martial arts, and spiritual titles.[3][4]Her father was Jewish, and her mother was Protestant.[5]
July was encouraged to work on her short fiction by authorRick Moody.[6]She was raised inBerkeley, California, where she first began staging plays at924 Gilman Street,[7][5]a localpunk rockclub.[8][9]She attendedThe College Preparatory Schoolin Oakland for high school.[3]She describes the experience as overwhelming.[5]She later attended the film school atUniversity of California Santa Cruz, but dropped out during her second year and moved toPortland, Oregon.[8][10]
After relocating toPortland, Oregon,[11]she took up performance art in "one woman shows".[12]Her performances were successful; she has been quoted as saying she has not worked a day job since she was 23 years old.[13]In an interview for theTate, she explained that she still tried to practice performance, partially due to its stark differences from filmmaking, such as its live audience or how "present" it is in comparison.[14]Portland is also where she began participating in theriot grrrlscene that was beginning to grow in the early 1990s.[5]
In the early stages of her film career, she created several small video projects and performances years prior to her feature film,Me and You and Everyone We Know.[5]However, while she worked on her art, July had to work severalodd jobs; she worked as a waitress, a tastemaker forCoca-Cola, alocksmith, and astripper.[15][8]
At the age of 16, Miranda wrote and directed a play known asThe Lifers, which was based on a close connection she had with a man who was incarcerated for murder. She moved on to stage it in punk clubs.[citation needed]
July was immersed in theriot grrlscene in Portland and motivated by itsdo-it-yourselfethos, and she began an effort that she described as "a free alternative distribution system for women movie-makers".[16]One of July's reasons for starting the project was to apply the concepts of riot grrrl into the filmmaking world.[15]The idea was to connect as many women artists as possible, let them see each other's work, and foster a sense of community.[17]Participants sent a self-made short film to July, who mailed back a compilation videotape containing that film and nine othersÂ â€“ a "chainletter tape".[18]When it began in 1995, the project was calledBig Miss Moviola[9]but was soon renamedJoanie4Jackie.[19]July also credits the project to the loneliness she was experiencing at the time, but felt she learned from the project immensely, saying "that was my film school".[5]July's first film,Atlanta, appears on the second tape of the series.[19]July continued to run the project for years, handing it off to the film department ofBard Collegein 2003.[20]
In spring 2016, July donated an archive ofJoanie4Jackieto theGetty Research Institute.[21]The collection includes more than 200 titles from the 1990s and 2000s, videos fromJoanie4Jackieevents, booklets, posters, hand-written letters from participants, and other documentation.[22]Thomas W. Gaehtgens, the director of the Getty Research Institute, stated that the acquisition is "an esteemed addition to our Special Collections that connects to work by many important 20th century artists who are also represented in our archives, such asEleanor Antin,Yvonne RainerandCarolee Schneemann."[23][24]
Miranda made a flier for other women filmmakers of her time to see as a way for them to send Miranda their VHS tapes of their work. By doing so, Miranda would be able to watch then send the films back to that person. This was how women during that time period were able to see each other's work.
Filmmakerrated her number one in their "25 New Faces of Indie Film" in 2004. After winning a slot in aSundanceworkshop, she developed her first feature-length film,Me and You and Everyone We Know, which opened in 2005.

In 1998, July madeLove Diamond, her first full-length multimedia performance pieceÂ â€“ in her description, a "live movie."[44]This two-hour stage work featured July playing multiple characters, humorously depicting women's perceived cultural roles.[49]This was followed by a second full-length performance piece,The Swan Tool, and a six-minute film,Getting Stronger Every Day(2001).[50]The latter is an abstract view of a grown man and a little girl, seemingly taunted by indistinct floating shapes while an offscreen narrator recounts a tale of real-life pedophilia.[50]The Swan Toolis another "live movie", a one-woman show in which July plays Lisa Cobb, a woman searching for her lost body. Although it's peppered with deadpan comedy, the surrealist story concerns "childhood sexual traumas, adult alienation, and persistent, unfocused guilt".[51]
In 2006, after completing her first feature film, she went on to create another multimedia piece,Things We Don't Understand and Definitely Are Not Going To Talk About, which she performed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York.[52]This stage show contained several ideas that would become key elements of her later film, The Future.[44]

With artistHarrell Fletcher, July founded the online art project calledLearning to Love You More(2002â€“2009). The project's website offered assignments to artists whose submissions became part of "an ever-changing series of exhibitions, screenings and radio broadcasts presented all over the world".[55]Over 8,000 people participated in the project.[5]In addition to its internet presentations,Learning to Love You Morealso compiled exhibitions for theWhitney Museum, theSeattle Art Museum, and other hosts.[55][56]A book version of the project's online art was released in 2007.[56][57]Starting May 1, 2009 the project's website stopped accepting assignment submissions. In 2010 theSan Francisco Museum of Modern Artacquired the website, to preserve it as an archive of the project online.[58]
July constructed a sculptural exhibition,Eleven Heavy Things, for the 2009Venice Biennale.[59]Its assortment of cartoonish shapes, made sturdy with fiberglass and steel, were designed for playful interaction by visitors.[60]The exhibition was also shown in New York City atUnion Square Parkand in Los Angeles at theMOCAPacific Design Center.[59]
In 2013 she organizedWe Think Alone, an art project involving the private emails of public figures. Unredacted except for the recipients' names, the emails were freely donated by a disparate group of notable persons including authorSheila Heti, theoretical physicistLee Smolin, basketball playerKareem Abdul-Jabbar, and actressKirsten Dunst. July grouped selected emails by topic, and sent a new set to the project's subscribers every week for 20 weeks.[61][62]As one reviewer described them, the emails are "simultaneously mundane and eerily revealing; they shed light on how people in the public eye craft their private identities... [they] also underscore, in some way, the way all of us present ourselves over email: excessively formal or passive-aggressive, lovey-dovey, flakey, overly excited."[62]
In 2014, July created Somebody, an iOS app[63]which allows users to compose a message to be delivered to someone else in-person, or to deliver someone else's message in-person. When you send your friend a message through Somebody, it goesÂ â€“ not to your friendÂ â€“ but to the Somebody user nearest your friend. This person (likely a stranger) delivers the message verbally, acting as your stand-in. Somebody is a far-reaching public art project that incites performance and twists our love of avatars and outsourcingÂ â€“ every relationship becomes a three-way. The project was funded byMiu Miu.[64]The app closed on October 31, 2015.[65]
In 2022 July collaborated withMack Booksto createServices, a limited edition book/sculpture composed of photographs and texts between July and Jay Benedicto, a trans woman living in the Philippines who offered services to increase the readership of self-published authors. The first six months of July and Benedicto's correspondence, which coincided with the first six months of North American lockdowns in response to theCOVID-19 pandemic, were published in the book. Only 25 copies were made available for sale.[66]
For its fall 2024 campaign,Pradaworked with July on "Now That We're Here", a photo series featuring stars likeHunter Schafer,Letitia Wright,Damson Idris,Harris DickinsonandMa Yiliwho encourage people to call into a hotline where they can interact with pre-recorded scripts recorded by July herself.[67]
Her short storyThe Boy from Lam Kienwas published in 2005 by Cloverfield Press, as a special-edition book with illustration by Elinor Nissley and Emma Hedditch. Another short story,Something That Needs Nothing, was published in the following year byThe New Yorker.[68]
No One Belongs Here More Than You,July's collection of short stories, was published by Scribner in 2007.[69]
It won theFrank O'Connor International Short Story Awardon September 24, 2007.[70]InThe New York Times, Sheelah Kolhatkar gave the collection a mixed review: "A handful of these stories are sweet and revealing, although in many cases the attempt to create 'art' is too self-conscious, and the effort comes off as pointlessly strange."[69]
As of 2015 the collection has more than 200,000 copies in circulation.[71]
July's non-fiction story collectionIt Chooses Youwas published byMcSweeney'sin 2011.[72]
While procrastinating the writing of her screenplayThe Futurein 2009, July criss-crossed Los Angeles accompanied by photographer Brigitte Sire to meet a random selection ofPennySaversellers, glimpsing thirteen surprisingly moving and profoundly specific realities, along the way shaping her film, and herself, in unexpected ways.[73]The work received mixed reviews with fans citing the collection's "lasting impression" of realistic struggle[74]and critics citing themumblecore-influenced artist's writing style as a "cheap trick" in text-format.[75]
July's first novelThe First Bad Manwas published by Scribner in January 2015.[76]The narrative centers around Cheryl Glickman, a middle-aged woman in crisis whose life abruptly changes course when a young woman, named Clee, moves into her home.[76][77]The novel explores the complex relationship between Cheryl and Clee.[78]
In her review forThe New York Times Book Review, reviewerLauren GroffwritesThe First Bad Man"makes for a wry, smart companion on any day. It's warm. It has a heartbeat and a pulse. This is a book that is painfully alive."[78]
July's second novel,All Fours, was released on May 14, 2024, fromPenguin Random House.[79]The novel follows a 45-year-oldperimenopausalwoman who, after having anextramarital affairduring aroad trip, has a sexual awakening.[80][81][82]It was shortlisted for the 2024National Book Award for Fiction.[83]
July was heavily inspired by theriot grrrlmovement. She was friends with several of the bands who were part of the movement such asBikini Kill,Excuse 17, andHeavens to Betsy.[15][11]
Her films have a common theme of "intimacy." For example, many of her work's titles use pronouns ("me", "you", "we", etc.). July creates "slice of life" films using ordinary characters and giving them attention within her films. She describes this as her being, "desperate to bring people together."[5]However, as she's aged she's become more interested in how people sabotage coming together.[14]
July receives criticism for being too "niche" or trying too hard to seem "quirky." According toThe New York Times,"July has come to personify everything infuriating about the Etsy-shopping, Wes Anderson-quoting, McSweeney's-reading, coastal-living category of upscale urban bohemia that flourished in the aughts [sic]." She is often lumped in with directors like Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach, but says she gets more push-back than them due to her films being so emotional and feminine, being called "precious" and "twee." In this same interview withThe New York Times,July explains that she likes the directors she's been compared to, but they never get criticized for making films about themselves, though she as a female filmmaker is often labeled "self-obsessed."[5]In a 2015Guardianarticle, July adds, "Yes, it's pretty clear that 'whimsical' is a diminishing word, [...] I almost think asking the question is like I'm being asked to gossip about myself. I think it's kind of a female thing, being asked to gossip about yourself. I think I'm maybe done with that."[84]
July also often includes the theme of sex in her films.The New York Timesdescribes this theme "as both a sudden surprise and a way to illuminate the inner lives of her characters". July elaborates: "I was always interested in sex, even as a kid. Sex includes shame and humiliation and fantasies and longing. It's so dense with the kinds of things I'm interested in."[5]
She has also expressed her interest in the rhythm and feeling of film, rather than being "inspired" by other filmmakers, and states that she wouldn't call herself a "cinephile."[5]
In betweenMe and You and Everyone We KnowandThe Future, July began to incorporate some of the oddball avant-garde things she had done in theater performance into her films, some of which was easier to swallow on stage but not on screen, such as the talking cat inThe Future,[14]which she was later criticized for by viewers.
July also has a strong interest in clothing and costume.[12]She served as thelookbookcreative director forUniqlo UT's 2019 clothing line.[85]
July is married to filmmaker and visual artistMike Mills, with whom she has a son,[86]born in March 2012.[87][88]July and Mills met at both of their firstSundance Festivalpremieres in 2005,[89]and married in mid-2009.[5]In July 2022, July announced that she and Mills were separated romantically, although they continue to live near each other and co-parent.[90]
In a 2007 interview withBustmagazine, July spoke of the importance whichfeminismhas had in her life, saying, "What's confusing about [being a feminist]? It's just being pro your ability to do what you need to do. It doesn't mean you don't love your boyfriend or whatever... When I say 'feminist', I mean that in the most complex, interesting, exciting way!"[91]In a later interview in 2017 on Idaho's Public Television station, July explained that once she started confronting the racial issues in current day politics, she started contacting publishers and revising her work, realizing that not everything she had said was racially and politically sound.[12]
She changed her last name to "July" when she was 15, after a character (based on her) in a story by her high school best friend,Johanna Fateman. She changed her name legally in her early 20s.[5]July describes her family as very "DIY", which probably accounts for some of July's makeshift style.[5]Therefore, when July wanted to change her last name, her father was very accepting of the decision.[12]Her father was a workaholic, which is something she believes she picked up from him.[12]Her family also dabbled in practicing New Age religions and discussed spirituality while she was growing up.[5]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (FullÂ list...)
AmÃ©lie of Leuchtenberg(1812â€“1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor PedroÂ I. She was the fourth child ofEugÃ¨ne de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with AmÃ©lie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria AmÃ©liawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and AmÃ©lie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of AmÃ©lie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich DÃ¼rck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
