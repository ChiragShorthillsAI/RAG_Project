In 1893,Nikola Teslaand a female companion areroller skating. A narrator explains that Tesla was inspired as a young boy when he was petting his cat and sawstatic electricity.
Nine years prior, in 1884 New York City, Tesla is working forThomas Edison, who disregards Tesla's suggestions of usingalternating current, and does not want to pay him for the invention. Their coworker explains that Edison's disapproval was partly because of the death of his wife. When they smash ice cream cones on each other, the narrator interrupts and says that isn't how it happened. She explains howGoogle searcheson Tesla show very few photographs and usually the same headshots. She goes into Tesla's childhood and schooling, and also that he tried to start his own company but failed, and ended up having to dig ditches. Edison, on the other hand, has more popularity, twice as many search results, but lives a lavish lifestyle and married and widowed young with his first wife Mary.
While Edison meets Mina, his second wife, in 1885, Tesla pitcheshis work on his induction motorto investors Brown and Peck. He and his assistant Szigeti impress Professor Anthony, who suggests he break up the invention into several patents. He meets Anthony's daughter Evelyn; andAnne Morgan, the daughter ofJ.P. Morganand also the film's narrator.
George Westinghouse, an inventor and businessman, buys Tesla's patents and fund production where the latter would get a royalty for every product installed in a home. He shares arivalry challenge from Edisonwho claims that direct current is superior, and that alternating current is dangerous. Edison shows the Westinghouse invention as acapital punishmenttool onWilliam Kemmler, who had killed his wife. Meanwhile, Tesla demonstrates his invention to an audience using two induction sticks that glow.
Szigeti invents a compass apparatus, but Tesla tells him it has already been invented, so Szigeti abandons his pursuits and seeks his fortune in South America. Kemmler's execution byelectric chairis botched. Anne gets to know Tesla more. Tesla's invention is used to power's theWorld's Fair in 1893in Chicago. Edison meets with Tesla and admits he was wrong about alternating current, and then he offers to partner with Tesla. Anne clarifies that this meeting never happened: Edison neither apologized nor offered to join forces.
Westinghouse tells Tesla that in order to keep his business going, he needs to do a merger, but has to cancel Tesla's contract regarding his horsepower royalties. Tesla tears up his contract.
Sarah Bernhardt, a celebrity actress, records for Edison'sgramophone. She meets Tesla at her event, but Edison is envious of Tesla and escorts her away.
Later, Tesla oversees the design of theNiagara Falls hydroelectric power plant. J.P. Morgan asks Anne if she thinks Tesla is interested in romancing her. Anne talks with Tesla about it and finds he has plans for another invention, but unfortunately he is moving far away to Colorado. In 1899Colorado Springs, he sets up hisTesla coilto harness and to transmit the power of the lightning storms.
Tesla meets up with Bernhardt who is touring the area. She shows interest in him, and invites him to attend her performance, but he does not show up. J.P. Morgan invests in his invention, giving him a check, which Tesla accepts.
In 1901, Edison'smining venture failsand he loses four million dollars. Tesla has not shown much progress in his work either, and even thoughMarconihas used Tesla's patents totransmit wireless signals, Tesla seems to be more interested in receiving and decoding signals he believes are from Mars. He asks J.P. Morgan for more funding, but is declined.
There's a scene of Tesla singing to "Everybody Wants to Rule the World", along with montage stills from the film.
Realizing she has no future with Tesla, Anne moves to France to work with an organization helping children. She explains how Tesla outlived his peers but dies alone at 87 years old. She reflects that today's world might be what he had imagined.

Gaffigan was born on July 7, 1966,[2]inElgin, Illinois,[3]the youngest of six children born to charity worker and fundraiser Marcia Miriam (née Mitchell) and banker Michael Ambrose Gaffigan.[4][5]Of Irish descent, his family's surname was Gavahan.[5]His maternal grandfather wasIowa Supreme CourtJusticeRichard F. Mitchell.[5]Gaffigan was raised inChestertoninNorthwest Indiana, a region that he has stated influenced his comedy because of its authenticity,[6]and often jokes about growing up in a large family.[7]His mother was accomplished atneedleworkand received a national award for original design and craftsmanship from the American Needlepoint Guild in 1985.[8]She died of cancer in 1990 at age 53.[8]
Gaffigan's father was the president and CEO of the Mercantile National Bank of Indiana for 15 years until his retirement in 1991.[9]A formerseminarian, he was also actively involved in local charity work.[10]He died oflung cancerin 1999.[10]Gaffigan's father was the first in his family to attend college,[11]and encouraged his children to seek careers that promised job security.[12]However, at about the age of five, Gaffigan announced that he wanted to be an actor.[13]
As a teenager, Gaffigan watchedSaturday Night Live.[11]He attendedLa Lumiere SchoolinLa Porte, Indiana, where he played on the school'sfootballteam.

For the first seven years of Gaffigan's stand-up career, he tried various styles, ranging from angry comedy to impressions and voices. Live comedy was in decline following its peak in the 1980s, and was further affected by the increased popularity ofcable television.[7]After periodically auditioning forThe Late Show with David Lettermanfor six years,[20]Gaffigan did a successful stand-up routine on the show in 1999,[21][22]and his career took off.[18]
Gaffigan's style is largelyobservational. Some of his main topics are laziness, eating and parenthood. His famousHot Pocketroutine was inspired by a commercial he saw that he mistook for aSaturday Night Livesketch.[13]He often performssoliloquies. For example, in high-pitched voice, he may portray someone giving negative feedback on his own performance (After he made a diarrhea joke in his 2012 special "Mr. Universe", he used the voice to say, "Really, he's using diarrhea jokes?"[23]). He has said, "That inside voice is my connection with the audience".[13]
In an interview with theDuluth News-Tribune, he explained that he began developing the voice as a teenager, when he disarmed people by talking for them in their presence.[24]He said he also used it to fend off hecklers earlier in his career, when comedy clubs were more "combative".[24]He cursed early in his career, and added cursing to his comedy albumDoing My Timeat the request of his label, in the hopes of drawing more teens.[25]He has now largely removed profanity from his routine, as he feels his subject matter doesn't lend itself to cursing and that it reduced the effort he put into crafting his jokes.[25][26]

In October 2005, he filmed a liveComedy Centralspecial that aired the following January,[7]and became the comedy album/DVDBeyond the Pale.

Comedy Central releasedKing Babyon DVD. In a March 2009 interview onAnytime with Bob Kushell, Gaffigan defended his naming of the tour, stating that he thought it would be funny that parents would be unsure about whether to bring their teenage children to the show.[28]Four years later, on March 14, 2013, Gaffigan was named the "King of Clean" by theWall Street Journal.[29]
On February 25, 2012, Gaffigan taped a one-hour stand-up special—Mr. Universe—at theWarner TheaterinWashington, D.C.;[30]it was nominated for a Grammy.[12]He announced that, based on the business model used byLouis C.K.'sLive at the Beacon Theater, the stand-up would be available online through his website for $5, with 20% of the total proceeds going to theBob Woodruff Foundation,[31]an organization that provides support to military veterans.[32]In 2012, he was among the top-ten grossing comics in the US, according to Pollstar.[12]

Gaffigan is widely noted as aneverymanand a clean comic;[12][42]some of his signature routines regardHot Pockets,[42][43]cake, andbacon.[23]His tendency to avoid profanity has drawn mixed responses. One critic compared him toFull House-eraBob Saget(who starred in the 1990s family show), which Gaffigan took as an insult.[25]Hampton Stevens inThe Atlanticwrote that Gaffigan "champions a vital element to standup that[Lenny] Brucehad taken away—the indispensable, but apparently forgotten idea that comedians have no obligation to be provocative, topical, socially conscious, or anything else but funny."[23]
I did my set, I walked off stage and they said the executive producer wants to meet you up in his office. I thought maybe it was going to be something good. I thought maybe Dave wants me to be a writer. But they wanted me to develop my ownshow.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
