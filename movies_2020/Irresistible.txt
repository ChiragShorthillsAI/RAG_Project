Irresistibleis a 2020 Americanpoliticalcomedy filmwritten and directed byJon Stewart. It starsSteve Carellin the lead role,Chris Cooper,Mackenzie Davis,Topher Grace,Natasha Lyonne, andRose Byrne. The film follows aDemocraticstrategist who tries to help a candidate win a local election in a smallright-wingtown. Originally set for a theatrical release in May 2020, the film was delayed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and then released onPremium VODandselected theaterson June 26, 2020, byFocus Features. It received mixed reviews from critics, who called it "a soft political satire".
Plunged into despair by the results of the2016 presidential election, veteranDemocratic Partycampaign consultant Gary Zimmer is shown a viral video of retiredMarineCol. Jack Hastings giving a speech in support of the illegal immigrant population of his hometown, the fictional town of Deerlaken,Wisconsin.
Calculating that getting Hastings elected as a Democrat in Deerlaken's upcoming mayoral election will help him convince the American people in the heartland to vote Democrat in the next presidential election, Zimmer travels to Wisconsin to persuade Hastings to run. Arriving in Deerlaken, Gary experiences the vast cultural divide between his home ofWashington, D.C., and the townspeople's more rural mannerisms and political beliefs.
Gary soon meets Hastings and his daughter Diana and pitches his idea. Hastings initially declines, considering himself more of a conservative and having no real interest in politics, but later relents and agrees to run under the condition that Gary serve as his campaign manager. Hastings recruits his friends and neighbors as volunteers for the campaign.
However, setbacks soon arise such as limitedWi-Fi,xenophobia,social conservatism, and the fact that the incumbent mayor, Braun, is being funded by theRepublican National Committee. The RNC also sends Faith Brewster, Gary's nemesis, to counter Gary.
As the race heats up, Gary takes Jack toNYCso they can recruit funds for the campaign to match Faith's money and resources. Jack gives a powerful speech to the possible donors about how he needs their help for his small town, which inspires Gary. Their donations allow Gary to upgrade their campaigning methods.
Soon the election polls show the two candidates neck-and-neck, although the Hastings campaign takes a dive when one of Gary's team members advertises a pro-contraceptiveplatform to a group of single women who turn out to be nuns. When Gary starts berating his teammates, Diana convinces him to apologize and that if he is going to run her father's campaign, he needs to be nice.
When it starts to look like Faith and Braun are going to win, Gary tries to convince Jack and Diana to play dirty and start exploiting Braun's skeletons. Diana is horrified that Gary would play dirty and secretly goes to Braun for advice. The two decide to secretly reveal a bigger scandal about Braun so Gary will not go after Braun's brother, which was his original plan. The scandal, however, proves to be false.
On Election Day, almost no one votes (only two votes are cast, with one vote going to each candidate, resulting in a tie), which confuses both Gary and Faith. It quickly becomes clear that the election was actually a setup. Diana reveals she masterminded the entire scheme, filming the video of her father's immigration speech (which was carefully scripted) so that the Democrats and Republicans would pour thousands of dollars into the election; the town has been quietly siphoning the money to get through its financial troubles due to the recent closure of a nearby military base.
Gary is shocked that Diana would play him and she then counters by explaining the town had no choice but to set him up because D.C. politicians play small towns like theirs all the time while doing nothing to help when times are tough. When Gary reveals that he has feelings for Diana, she rejects him, pointing to their age difference.
Later, Diana becomes the mayor of Deerlaken after a special election.
The film ends with three scenes leading into each other, each with its own set of cast credits: Gary and Diana embrace at a construction site for a new public building; until Gary is snapped out of that thought to reveal Gary and Ann, the pastry chef, in bed, discussing plans for a new bakery; until Gary finally snaps out of that to show Gary and Faith kiss and discuss their investment portfolio in their kitchen.
Apost-credits sceneshows a short interview withTrevor Potter, an official of theFederal Election Commission, discussing the shortcomings of oversight over elections fund-raising. The screen shows the title IRRESISTIBLE fading into the word RESIST.
It was announced in October 2018 thatJon Stewartwas planning his next directorial effort, withSteve Carellin talks to star, contingent on scheduling.[5]In March 2019,Rose Byrneentered negotiations to join the film.[6]That same month,Chris Cooperjoined the cast of the film, withFocus Featuresacquiring distribution rights.[1]In April 2019,Mackenzie Davis,Topher Grace, andDebra Messingjoined the cast of the film.[7][8][9]Will Sasso,CJ Wilson,Natasha Lyonne, andAlan Aisenbergjoined in May.[10][11][12]In June 2019,Brent Sextonjoined the cast of the film.[13]
Production began in April 2019 InAtlanta, Georgia.[14]Filming took place mostly in Rockmart, Georgia.
The film was releaseddigitallyin the United States throughPremium VOD, as well as inselected theaterson June 26, 2020.[15][16]It was originally scheduled for a wide theatrical release on May 29, 2020, but due tomovie theater closuresthat started in mid-March because of theCOVID-19 pandemicrestrictions, it was cancelled.[17][18]
The film made an estimated $100,000 from 238 theaters in its domestic opening weekend.[3]It was released in France on July 1, 2020, where it grossed $52,673 from 117 theaters.[4]
In its debut weekend,Irresistiblewas the top-rented film on theiTunes Storeand fourth onFandangoNow(although since the service reports totals by the week it was likely first over the three-day frame).[19][20]In its second weekend the film fell to fourth iTunes and fifth on FandangoNow, but ranked first onSpectrum's weekly chart,[21][22]then placed sixth on Fandango and 10th on Spectrum the week after that.[23]In October 2020,The Hollywood Reportersaid the film was the eighth-most popular PVOD title amid theCOVID-19 pandemic.[24]
Onreview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 41% based on 227 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site's critics consensus reads, "A soft political satire that proves frustratingly less than the sum of its talented parts,Irresistibleis anything but."[25]AtMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[26]
Owen GleibermanofVarietysaid that "Irresistiblescores points yet feels behind the curve. You wish it were a bold satirical bulletin, or maybe just Stewart's pricelessly amusing version of aChristopher Guestmovie. Instead, the film is a lot like a politician: It makes a big show of leading the viewer, but without rocking the boat."[27]David Ehrlich ofIndieWiregave the film a "C" and, although praising Byrne's performance, wrote: "A Capra-esque moral comedy that unfolds with all the subtlety of sky writing and none of the same panache,Irresistibleis a perverse bid for clarity that feels like it was left behind like a relic from some long-distant past."[28]
TheSan Francisco Chronicle's G. Allen Johnson called it "perhaps the most lamebrain, ham-fisted and insulting movie of the year".[29]
Mark Kermodegave a fairly positive review of the film inThe Guardian, comparing it toWag the DogandLocal Hero, saying: "there's something reassuringly nostalgic aboutIrresistible... Stewart is back on home ground, opening with a TV show-style segment about the falsehoods of the 'spin room' ('I look forward to lying to you in the future') that we now take for granted."[30]

Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]
In April 2017, Vine Alternative Investments re-acquired the pre-2008Roguefilm library from Focus Features.[25]
In August 2011, Focus Features launched Focus World, a label focusing on thevideo on demandmarket with initial plans to distribute 15 films per year, with one film being released per month.[26]
As a distributor, Focus' most successful release in North America to date is the 2019 filmDownton Abbey, which earned $84.5 million during its first weekend at the box office and surpassingBrokeback Mountain, which earned $83 million at the North American box office.[27]However, this is not counting the domestic total ofTraffic, which earned $124.1 million under the USA Films banner. The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

Stewart was born Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz atDoctors Hospitalin theUpper East SideofNew York City. His father, Donald Leibowitz (1931–2013), was an energy coordinator for theNew Jersey Department of the Treasury,[8][9][10]and his mother, Marian Leibowitz (née Laskin), was a teacher and later aneducational consultant.[11]Stewart's family isAshkenazi Jewish(Polish-Jewish,Ukrainian-Jewish,Belarusian-Jewish, and possiblyLithuanian-Jewish); his parents had immigrated to theUnited StatesfromEurope. One of his grandfathers was born inManzhouli, present-dayChina.[12]He is the second of four sons, with older brother Lawrence[13]and younger brothers Dan and Matthew.[9][14]
Stewart's parents divorced when he was eleven years old, and he became largely estranged from his father.[11]Due to their strained relationship, Stewart dropped his surname and began using his middle name alone, stating: "There was a thought of using my mother's maiden name, but I thought that would be just too big [of] a 'fuck you' to my dad.... Did I have some problems with my father? Yes. Yet people always view [changing my surname] through theprism of ethnic identity."[15]He had his surname legally changed to "Stewart" in 2001.[15][16]In 2015, he described his relationship with his father as "still complicated" after his father's death two years earlier. Stewart and his older brother, Lawrence, who was previously the chief operating officer ofNYSE Euronext(the parent company of theNew York Stock Exchange),[13][17]grew up inLawrenceville, New Jersey.[11]Stewart has stated that he experienced muchantisemitismas a child, having been bullied frequently due to hisJewish identity.[18]He describes himself in high school as "very intoEugene Debsand a bit of aleftist."[19]Stewart grew up in the era of theVietnam Warand theWatergate scandal, which inspired in him "a healthy skepticism towards official reports." His first job was working with his brother at aWoolworth'sstore, and he has jokingly said that being fired by Lawrence himself was one of the "scarring events" of his youth.[15]He has also credited renowned television producerNorman Learas someone who "raised me."[20]
After graduating fromLawrence High Schoolin 1980, Stewart attended theCollege of William & MaryinWilliamsburg, Virginia, where he initiallymajoredinchemistrybefore switching topsychology.[11][21]While at William & Mary, Stewart became a member of thePi Kappa Alphafraternity,[22]but eventually began disassociating himself from other members, leaving the fraternity altogether after six months.[23]"My college career was waking up late, memorizing someone else's notes, doingbong hits, and going to soccer practice", he later said.[24]He was a three-year starter in 1981, 1982 and 1983 with theTribe men's soccer team. He had 10 goals and 12 assists on a squad that went 40–15–9 (.695) in his three seasons with the program.[25]He is listed as Jon Leibowitz in official William & Mary Athletics records.[26]The former head coach of the Tribe men's soccer team from 1971 to 2003,Al Albert, describes Jon as "athletic and feisty and quick" and added that he "wasn't the most technical or clinical player, but he could make things happen."[27]He graduated from William & Mary in 1984 with aBachelor of Arts. Twenty years later, the college awarded him an honoraryMaster of Artsdegree.[28]
After college, Stewart held numerous jobs: contingency planner for theNew Jersey Department of Human Services, contract administrator for theCity University of New York, puppeteer for children with disabilities, soccer coach atGloucester High Schoolin Virginia, caterer,busboy, shelf stocker at Woolworth's, bartender at the Franklin Corner Tavern (a blue-collar bar inLawrence), and bartender at theCity Gardensnightclub inTrenton, New Jersey.[11][29][30]He has said that working at City Gardens was a pivotal moment for him: "Finding this place City Gardens was like, 'Oh, maybe I'm not a giant weirdo. Maybe there are other people who have a similar sense of yearning for something other than what they have now.' I think it inspired a lot of people, man. It was a very creative environment. It was a place of great possibility."[31]
With a reputation for being a funny man in school,[11][29]Stewart returned to New York City in 1986 to try his hand at thecomedy clubcircuit, but could not muster the courage to get on stage until the following year.[32]He made his stand-up debut atThe Bitter End, where one of his comedic idols,Woody Allen, also began.[33]He began using the stage name Jon Stewart by dropping his last name and changing the spelling of his middle name, Stuart, to Stewart. He often jokes that it was because people had trouble pronouncing Leibowitz, or it "sounded too Hollywood" (a reference toLenny Bruce's joke on the same theme).[34]He has implied that the name change was due to a strained relationship with his father, with whom Stewart no longer had any contact.[30]
Stewart became a regular at theComedy Cellar, where he was the last performer every night. For two years, he performed at 2 a.m. while developing his comedy style.[35]In 1989, he landed his first television job as a writer forCaroline's Comedy Hour.

Later in 1993, Stewart developedThe Jon Stewart Show, a talk show onMTV, which was later dropped by the network and was syndicated for its last two years.The Jon Stewart Showwas the first talk show on that network and was an instant hit, becoming the second-highest rated MTV show, behindBeavis and Butt-Head.[41]In 1994,ParamountcanceledThe Arsenio Hall Showand, with new corporate sibling MTV (through MTV parentViacom's acquisition of the studio), launched an hour-longsyndicatedlate-night version ofThe Jon Stewart Show. Many local affiliates had moved Hall's show to 2 a.m. during its decline and Stewart's show inherited such early morning time slots in many cities. Ratings were dismal and the show was canceled in June 1995.[42]
Among the fans of the show wasDavid Letterman, who was the final guest ofThe Jon Stewart Show. Letterman signed Stewart with his production company,Worldwide Pants.[43]Stewart then became a frequent guest host forTom SnyderonThe Late Late Show with Tom Snyder, which was produced by Letterman and aired after theLate ShowonCBS. This led to much speculation that Stewart would soon replace Snyder permanently,[44]but instead, Stewart was offered the time slot after Snyder's, which he turned down.[45]
Stewart's first film role was a bit part in the box-office bomb,Mixed Nuts.He landed a minor part inThe First Wives Club, but hisscene was deleted.[46]In 1995, Stewart signed a three-year deal withMiramax.[47]Stewart played romantic leads in the films,Playing by HeartandWishful Thinking.

In 1998, Stewart hosted the television special,Elmopalooza, celebrating 30 years ofSesame Street. He has guest-starred on other sitcoms includingThe Nanny,Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist,Spin City, andNewsRadio. The same year Stewart released his first book,Naked Pictures of Famous People(1998), a collection of humorous short stories and essays. The book reachedThe New York TimesBest Seller List.[49]In the mid-1990s, Stewart launched his ownproduction company,Busboy Productions, naming the company in reference to his previous job as abusboy. Stewart signed a deal withMiramaxto develop projects through his company, but none of his ideas have been produced. After Stewart's success as host and producer ofThe Daily Show, he revived Busboy Productions withDaily ShowproducersBen Karlinand Rich Korson. In 2002, Busboy planned to produce a sitcom for NBC starring Stephen Colbert, but the show did not come to fruition.[50][full citation needed]
Later that year, when Craig Kilborn left the show to replace Tom Snyder onThe Late Late Show, Stewart began hostingThe Daily Showon Comedy Central.The Daily Showblends humor with the day's top news stories, usually in politics, while simultaneously poking fun at politicians, newsmakers, and the news media. In an interview onThe O'Reilly Factor, Stewart denied the show has any intentional political agenda, saying the goal was "schnicks and giggles" and that "[t]he same weakness that drove me into comedy also informs my show", meaning that he was uncomfortable talking without hearing the audience laugh.[51]In his first Daily Show on-air appearance on January 11, 1999, Stewart told his guest that evening,Michael J. Fox, that he felt as if "this is my bar mitzvah".[52]His style was described by one critic as, "Stewart does not offer us cynicism for its own sake, but as a playful way to offer the kinds of insights that are not permitted in more serious news formats that slavishly cling to official account of events."[53]
He appeared inHalf Bakedas an "enhancement smoker" and inBig DaddyasAdam Sandler's roommate; he has joked on theDaily Showand in the documentaryThe Aristocratsthat to get the role, he slept with Sandler. Stewart often makes fun of his appearances in the high-profile flop,Death to Smoochy,[54]in which he played a treacherous television executive; and the animated filmDoogal,[55]where he voiced the villain Zeebad. In 2007, Stewart made acameo appearanceas himself inEvan Almighty, which starred formerDaily Showcorrespondent Steve Carell. In the movie, Stewart was seen on a television screen in a fictionalDaily Showepisode poking fun at Carell's character for building anark.
Until Trevor Noah permanently took over the show in 2015, Stewart hosted almost all airings of the program, except for a few occasions when correspondents such asStephen Colbert,Rob Corddry,Jason Jones, andSteve Carellsubbed for him, and duringJohn Oliver's stint as host during the summer of 2013. Stewart won twentyPrimetime Emmy AwardsforThe Daily Showas either a writer or producer, and two for producingThe Colbert Report(2013–14), earning a total of twenty-two Primetime Emmy Awards, the most wins for a male individual.[56]In 2005, Stewart andThe Daily Showreceived theGrammy AwardforBest Comedy Albumfor the audiobook edition ofAmerica (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction. In 2000 and 2004, the show won twoPeabody Awardsfor its coverage of the US presidential elections in those years, called "Indecision 2000" and "Indecision 2004", respectively.[57][58]
The show of September 20, 2001, the first show after theattacks of September 11, 2001, began with no introduction.[59]Before this, the introduction included footage of a fly-in toward theWorld Trade Centerand New York City. The first nine minutes of the show included a tearful Stewart discussing his personal view on the event. His remarks ended as follows:
The view ... from my apartment ... was the World Trade Center ... and now it's gone, and they attacked it. This symbol of American ingenuity, and strength, and labor, and imagination and commerce, and it is gone. But you know what the view is now? TheStatue of Liberty. The view from theSouth of Manhattanis now the Statue of Liberty. You can't beat that.[59]
In mid-2002, amid rumors that David Letterman was going to switch from CBS to ABC when his contract ran out, Stewart was rumored as Letterman's replacement on CBS.[60]Ultimately, Letterman renewed his contract with CBS.
In late 2002, ABC offered Stewart his own talk show to air right afterNightline. Stewart's contract withThe Daily Showwas near expiring, and he expressed strong interest. ABC, however, decided to give another Comedy Central figure,Jimmy Kimmel, the post-Nightlineslot.[61]In 2004, Stewart andThe Daily Showwriting staff released,America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction, a mock high-school history textbook offering insights into the unique American system of government, dissecting its institutions, explaining its history and processes, and satirizing such popular American political precepts as "one man, one vote", "government by the people", and "every vote counts". The book sold millions of copies upon its 2004 release and ended the year as a top-fifteen best seller.[3]He also delivered the commencement address for the class of 2004 at his alma mater, the College of William & Mary. In 2005, Stewart provided the voice of PresidentJames A. Garfieldfor the audiobook version ofSarah Vowell'sAssassination Vacation.[62]
In 2005, Comedy Central reached an agreement with Busboy in which Comedy Central would provide financial backing for the production company. Comedy Central has a first-look agreement on all projects, after which Busboy is free to shop them to other networks.[63][64]The deal spawned theDaily Showspin-offThe Colbert Reportand its replacement,The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore. Other projects include the sitcom pilotThree Strikes, the documentarySportsfan, the seriesImportant Things with Demetri Martin, and the filmThe Donor.[65]In 2007, Stewart voiced Mort Sinclaire, former TV comedy writer and communist, onStephen Colbert's audiobook version ofI Am America (And So Can You!).[66]
On April 4, 2006, Stewart confrontedUS SenatorJohn McCain(R-AZ) onThe Daily Showabout his decision to appear atLiberty University, an institution founded byJerry Falwellwhom McCain previously had denounced as one of the "agents of intolerance". In the interchange, Stewart asked McCain, "You're not freaking out on us? Are you freaking out on us, because if you're freaking out ... and you're going into the crazybaseworld—are you going into crazy base world?" McCain replied, "Just– just– just a little" and "I'm afraid so." The clip was played onCNN,[67][68]was noted and discussed in more detail in theblogosphere[69]and was followed up on in themainstream media.[70]
In 2007,The Daily Showwas involved in former correspondentStephen Colbert's announcement that he would run for president in 2008. In 2008, Stewart appeared on the news programDemocracy Now!.[71]A 2008New York Timesstory questioned whether he was, in a phrase originally used to describe longtime network news anchorWalter Cronkite, "the most trusted man in America".[72]
On April 28, 2009, during a discussion ontorturewithClifford May, Stewart stated that former PresidentHarry S. Trumanwas awar criminalfor hisuse of the atomic bomb on Japan during World War II.[73][74]He defended his view moments later: "Here's what I think of theatom bombs. I think if you dropped an atom bomb fifteen miles offshore and you said, 'The next one's coming and hitting you', then I would think it's okay. To drop it on a city, and kill a hundred thousand people? Yeah. I think that's criminal." On April 30, Stewart apologized on his program, and stated he did not believe Truman was a war criminal:[75]"I shouldn't have said that, and I did. So I say right now, no, I don't believe that to be the case. The atomic bomb, a very complicated decision in the context of a horrific war, and I walk that back because it was in my estimation a stupid thing to say."[76]
On September 16, 2010, Stewart andStephen Colbertannounced a rally for October 30, known as theRally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear.

Clinton's condemnations ofHamasled Stewart to ask her: "But don't you think they would look at that though as, they've given a lot of different things a chance and these are the only guys to them that are giving any resistance to what their condition is?" For Gazans living in that situation, he said Hamas could be viewed as "freedom fighters".[101][102]

ShearofThe New York Timesalso picked up on the story.[107]Stewart responded on his show by pointing out that the meetings were listed in the president's publicly available visitor log and that he has been asked to meet privately by many prominent individuals, includingRoger AilesofFox News. He said Obama encouraged him not to make young Americans cynical about their government and Stewart said that his reply was that he was "skeptically idealistic".[108]
On June 19, 2015, in the wake of theCharleston Church Shooting, Stewart decided not to write jokes for the opening monologue. Elaborating on his decision, Stewart stated, "I honestly have nothing other than just sadness". Stewart spoke about the racial disparity and injustices in America, saying "TheConfederate flagflies over South Carolina ... and the roads are named for Confederate generals" describing it as "racial wallpaper".[109]Instead he designated a large portion of the show to his guest that nightMalala Yousafzai, calling her "an incredible inspiration," and that "to be quite honest with you, I don't think there's anyone else in the world I would rather talk to tonight than Malala: So that's what we're going to do. And sorry about no jokes."[110]
On August 5, 2015, Stewart's friend of 30 years, comedianLouis C.K., was selected to be the last guest before the finalDaily Showepisode with Stewart helming the show. C.K. joked that he was there "representing comedy to say good job".[111]

In November 2015, it was announced that Stewart signed a four-year deal withHBOthat would include exclusive digital content for HBO NOW, HBO Go, and other platforms.[121]HBO programming president Casey Bloys has said that "the idea is it will be an animated parody of a cable news network with anOnion-like portal."[122]The team began working with the cloud graphics company, OTOY, to build a system for creating content. Working on the project were Mike Brown, Steve Waltien, Chelsea Devantez, Lucy Steiner, Kate James, and Robby Slowik. The team tested material in Red Bank, New Jersey, at TheCount Basie TheatrePerforming Arts Academy.[123]The show's premiere was moved several times, from fall 2016,[124]to the first quarter of 2017,[125]and then cancelled on May 23, 2017.[126]The cancelation statement read: "HBO and Jon Stewart have decided not to proceed with a short-form digital animated project... We all thought the project had great potential but there were technical issues in terms of production and distribution that proved too difficult given the quick turnaround and topical nature of the material. We're excited to report that we have some future projects together which you will be hearing about in the near future".[126]
In July 2017, HBO announced Stewart would produce a stand-up comedy special for the network, his first stand-up special since 1996.[127]Ultimately, no special aired.

On directing, Stewart noted onEmployee of the MonththatThe Daily Showinfluenced his directing process more than his acting gigs did. He said, "It's about the collaboration. It's about understanding. Doing a show taught me this process of clarity of vision, but the flexibility of process. So know your intention, know where you're wanting to go with the scene with the way that you want it to go, the momentum shifts, the emphasis, where you want it to be."[130]He also expressed interest in directing more films.[131]Stewart directed the political satireIrresistible, released in June 2020,[132][133]which follows a demoralized Democratic strategist (played byDaily ShowalumnusSteve Carell), who helps a retired veteran (Chris Cooper) run for mayor in a small,blue collartown in Wisconsin.[134]

Stewart has hosted theGrammy Awardstwice, in 2001 and in 2002,[144]and the78th Academy Awards, which were held March 5, 2006, at theKodak Theatrein Hollywood.[145]Critical response to Stewart's performance was mixed.Roger Ebertcompared him favorably to legendary Oscar hostJohnny Carson.[146]Other reviewers were less positive;Tom ShalesofThe Washington Postsaid that Stewart hosted with "smug humorlessness". James Poniewozik ofTIMEsaid that Stewart was a bad host, but a great "anti-host" in that he poked fun at parts of the broadcast that deserved it, which lent him a degree of authenticity with the non-Hollywood audience.[147]Stewart and correspondentJohn Oliverlater poked fun at his lackluster reception onThe Daily Showcoverage of the79th Academy Awardsby saying that the "demonof last year's Oscars had finally beenexorcised".[148]
Stewart returned to host the80th Academy Awardson February 24, 2008.[149]The reception to his performance was better this time. Matthew Gilbert of theBoston Globefelt the ceremony was average, but praised Stewart, writing that, "It was good to see Jon Stewart being Jon Stewart. He is shaping up to be a dependable Oscar host for the post-Billy Crystal years. He's not musical, but he's versatile enough to swing smoothly between jokes about politics, Hollywood, new media, and, most importantly, hair."[150]Varietycolumnist Brian Lowry lauded Stewart's performance noting that he "earned his keep by maintaining a playful, irreverent tone throughout the night, whether it was jesting aboutCate Blanchett's versatility or watchingLawrence of Arabiaon aniPhonescreen.[151]
In December 2009, Stewart gave a speech at theJohn F. Kennedy Center for the Performing ArtshonoringBruce Springsteen, one of that year'sKennedy Center Honorsrecipients, and of whom Stewart is a fan.[152]Stewart gave another speech paying tribute to Springsteen in February 2013 as part of the singer'sMusiCares Person of the Yearaward ceremony.[153]

Stewart got into aTwitterargument with then-presidential candidateDonald Trump, who in multiple tweets stated that Stewart changing his name indicated that he was a fraud. Stewart and some analysts considered this to beanti-Semitic. Trump then tweeted that Stewart should be "proud of his heritage", and Stewart tweeted back, facetiously, that Trump's real name was "Fuckface Von Clownstick" and that Trump should be proud of the "Clownstick heritage".[158][159][160]

In 2000, when he was labeled aDemocrat, Stewart generally agreed, but described his political affiliation as "moresocialistorindependent" than Democratic.[176]Stewart has also voted forRepublicans, the last time being in the1988 presidential electionwhen he voted forGeorge H. W. BushoverMichael Dukakis. He described Bush as having "an integrity about him that I respected greatly."[177]Stewart has said that during the2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, he was not a supporter of nomineeJoe Biden, describing himself as more of a, "Sanders,Warrenguy."[178]He reluctantly supported his candidacy in 2020, but has criticized him since then overhis age, and his handling of the 2023Israel-Hamas War.[179][180]He has been a vocal proponent of the United States implementing asingle-payer healthcare system.[181]
Stewart is known as an outspoken, humorous critic of personality-driven media shows, in particular, those of theUS mediabroadcast networkssuch asCNN,Fox News, andMSNBC. Critics say Stewart benefits from a double standard: he critiques other news shows from the safe, removed position of his "news satire" desk;[182][183]Stewart asserts that neither his show nor Comedy Central purport to be anything other than satire and comedy.[183]
In a televised exchange with then-CNN correspondentTucker CarlsononCrossfireon October 15, 2004, Stewart criticized the state of television journalism and pleaded with the show's hosts to "stop hurting America", and he referred to both Carlson and co-hostPaul Begalaas "partisanhacks".[183][184]When posted on the internet, this exchange became widely viewed and was a topic of much media discussion.[185]
Despite being on the program to comment on current events, Stewart immediately shifted the discussion toward the show itself, asserting thatCrossfirehad failed in its responsibility to inform and educate viewers about politics as a serious topic. Stewart stated that the show engaged in partisan hackery instead of honest debate, and said that the hosts' assertion thatCrossfireis a debate show is like "sayingpro wrestlingis a show about athletic competition". Carlson responded by saying that Stewart criticizes news organizations for not holding public officials accountable, but when he interviewedJohn Kerry, Stewart asked a series of "softball" questions (Stewart has acknowledged he voted for Kerry in the2004 presidential election).[186]Stewart responded that he didn't realize "the news organizations look to Comedy Central for their cues on integrity". When Carlson continued to press Stewart on the Kerry issue, Stewart said, "You're on CNN! The show that leads into me ispuppets making crank phone calls! What is wrong with you?" In response to prods from Carlson, "Come on. Be funny." Stewart said, "No, I'm not going to be your monkey." Later in the show when Carlson jibed, "I do think you're more fun on your show", Stewart retorted, "You're as big a dick on your show as you are on any show." In response to Stewart's criticisms, Carlson said, "You need to get a job at a journalism school", to which Stewart responded, "You need to go to one!"[183]
Stewart discussed the incident onThe Daily Showthe following Monday:
We decided to go to this place,Crossfire, which is anuancedpublic policy analysis show ... named afterthe stray bullets that hit innocent bystanders in a gang fight. So I go toCrossfireand, let's face it, I was dehydrated, it's theMartin Lawrencedefense ... and I had always in the past mentioned to friends and people that I meet on the street that I think that show ... um ... blows. So I thought it was only the right thing to do to go say it to them personally on their program, but here's the thing about confronting someone with that on their show: They'rethere!Uncomfortable! And they were very mad, because apparently, when you invite someone on a show calledCrossfireand you express an opinion, they don't care for that ... I told them that I felt their show was hurting America and they came back at me pretty good, they said that I wasn't being funny. And I said to them, "I know that, but tomorrow I will go back to being funny, and your show will still blow."[182][187]
In January 2005, CNN announced that it was cancelingCrossfire. When asked about the cancellation, CNN's incoming president,Jonathan Klein, referred to Stewart's appearance on the show: "I think he made a good point about the noise level of these types of shows, which does nothing to illuminate the issues of the day."[188]
On March 18, 2009, Carlson wrote a blog entry forThe Daily Beastcriticizing Stewart for his handling of the CNBC controversy (see below). Carlson discussed the CNN incident and claimed that Stewart remained backstage for at least "an hour" and "continued to lecture our staff", something Carlson described as, "one of the weirdest things I have ever seen".[189]
Stewart again became aviral internet phenomenonfollowing a March 4, 2009,The Daily Showsequence. CNBC canceledRick Santelli's scheduled appearance onThe Daily Showthat day, so the show ran a short segment showing CNBC giving poor investment advice.[190]
Subsequent media coverage of exchanges between Stewart andJim Cramer, who had been featured heavily in the original segment, led to a highly anticipated face-to-face confrontation onThe Daily Show.[191]The episode received much media attention and became the second most-viewed episode ofThe Daily Show, trailing only the 2009 Inauguration Day episode. It had 2.3 million total viewers, and the next day, the show's website saw its highest day of traffic in 2009.[192]Although Cramer acknowledged on the show that some of Stewart's criticisms of CNBC were valid and that the network could "do better", he later said onThe Today Showthat Stewart's criticism of the media was "naïve and misleading".[193]
Throughout his tenure onThe Daily Show, Stewart frequently accused Fox News of distorting the news to fit aconservativeagenda, at one point ridiculing the network as "the meanest sorority in the world".[194]In November 2009, Stewart "called out" Fox News for using some footage from a previousTea Partyrally during a report on a more recent rally, making the latter event appear more highly attended than it was. The show's anchor,Sean Hannity, apologized for the footage use the following night.[195]A month later, Stewart criticizedFox & FriendscohostGretchen Carlson– a formerMiss Americaand aStanfordgraduate – for claiming that shegoogledwords such as "ignoramus" and "czar". Stewart said that Carlson was dumbing herself down for "an audience who sees intellect as an elitist flaw".[196]
Stewart stepped up his criticism of Fox News in 2010; within five months,The Daily Showhad 24 segments criticizing the Fox News coverage.[84]Bill O'Reilly, host of the talk showThe O'Reilly Factoron Fox News, countered thatThe Daily Showwas a "key component of left-wing television" and that Stewart loved Fox News because the network was "not boring".[84]
During an interview withChris Wallaceon June 19, 2011, Stewart called Wallace "insane" for saying that Stewart's earlier comparison of the marketing techniques of aSarah Palincampaign video and an anti-herpesmedicine ad was a political comment. Stewart also said Fox viewers are the "most consistently misinformed" viewers of political media.[197]This comment was ranked by the fact-checking site,PolitiFact, as false, with conditions. Stewart later accepted his error.[198]
In 2014, Stewart engaged in an extended "call-out" of Fox News, based on their coverage offood stampsand US government assistance, opining that said coverage was biased.[199]This culminated in segments across multiple episodes, specifically singling out Sean Hannity and his show's coverage of theBundy standoff. Hannity would "return fire" by calling out Stewart for associating himself withCat Stevensduring his Rally in 2010.[200]Stewart responded to this by criticizing Hannity for frequently callingTed Nugenta "friend and frequent guest" on his program and supporting Nugent's violent rhetoric toward Barack Obama andHillary Clintonin 2007.[201]In late August 2014, Stewart criticized the manner in which Fox News portrayed the events surrounding the shooting of teenagerMichael Brownby police officer Darren Wilson inFerguson, Missouri, and the subsequent protests from citizens.[202]
Stewart was an important factor in the unionization of theComedy Centralwriters.The Daily Showwriters were the first of Comedy Central's writers to be able to join the guild, after which other shows followed.[203][204]
Stewart supported the2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. OnThe Daily Showepisode just before the strike, he sarcastically commented about how Comedy Central had made available all episodes for free on their website, but without advertising, and said, "go support our advertisers". The show went on hiatus when the strike began, as did other late-night talk shows. Upon Stewart's return to the show on January 7, 2008, he refused to use the title,The Daily Show, stating thatThe Daily Showwas the show made with all of the people responsible for the broadcast, including his writers. During the strike, he referred to his show asA Daily Show with Jon Stewartuntil the strike ended on February 13, 2008.[205]
Stewart's choice to return to the air did bring criticism that he was undermining the writers of his show.Seth MacFarlanewrote an inside joke into an episode ofFamily Guyabout this, causing Stewart to respond with an hour-long call in which he questioned how MacFarlane could consider himself the "moral arbiter" of Hollywood.[206]FormerDaily ShowwriterDavid Feldmanalso accused Stewart of being anti-union at the time and of punishing his writers for their decision to unionize by not using their material.[207]
The Writers Guild Strike of 2007–2008 also was responsible for anotable mock feudbetween Stewart,Stephen Colbert, andConan O'Brienin early 2008. Without writers to help fuel their banter, the three comedians concocted acrossover/rivalry to garner more viewers during the ratings slump. Colbert claimed that because of "the Colbert bump", he was responsible forMike Huckabee's success in the2008 presidential race. O'Brien claimed that he was responsible for Huckabee's success because not only had he mentioned Huckabee on his show, but also that he was responsible forChuck Norris's success (Norris backed Huckabee). In response, Stewart claimed that he was responsible for the success of O'Brien since Stewart had featured him onThe Jon Stewart Show, and in turn, the success of Huckabee. This resulted in a three-part comedic battle among the three pundits, with all three appearing on each other's shows. The feud ended onLate Night with Conan O'Brienwith a mock brawl involving the three hosts.[208]
Over the years, Stewart sometimes usedThe Daily Showto argue for causes such as the treatment ofveteransand9/11 first responders. He is credited with breaking a Senate deadlock over a bill to providehealth careandbenefitsfor 9/11 emergency workers; the bill passed three days after he featured a group of 9/11 responders on the show. In March 2009, he criticized a White House proposal to remove veterans from Veterans Administration rolls if they had private health insurance; the White House dropped the plan the next day.[89]In 2010, Stewart held an interview with a panel of four of the 9/11 first responders—Kenny Specht with theFDNY, Chris BowmanNYPD, Ken GeorgeDOT, and Kevin Devlin, Operating Engineer of Heavy Equipment—who discussed their health problems with Stewart. In 2015, four months after leavingThe Daily Show, he returned to reunite the four with Specht as the only panelist healthy enough to attend. Devlin had died and the two other panelists, Bowman and George, were too ill to make it to the show.[209][210]
In February and June 2019, Stewart again went to Congress to oppose the $7.375 billion limit in pay-outs to9/11 first respondersthrough December 2020 and to lobby for permanent funding for theVictims Compensation Fundpast December 2020, delivering a tearful testimony.[211][212]
Sick and dying, they brought themselves down here to speak to no one. Shameful. It's an embarrassment to the country and it's a stain on this institution. And you should be ashamed of yourselves for those that aren't here. But you won't be because accountability doesn't appear to be something that occurs in this chamber...And I'm sorry if I sound angry and undiplomatic. But I'm angry, and you should be too, and they're all angry as well and they have every justification to be that way. There is not a person here, there is not an empty chair on that stage that didn't tweet out "Never Forget the heroes of 9/11. Never forget their bravery. Never forget what they did, what they gave to this country." Well, here they are. And where are they? And it would be one thing if their callous indifference and rank hypocrisy were benign, but it's not. Your indifference cost these men and women their most valuable commodity: time. It's the one thing they're running out of.[213][214]
Stewart continued to be a vocal advocate, appearing on late night shows such asThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, and news programs such asFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace, andThe Fox Report with Shepherd Smith.[215]On July 12, 2019, the House approved the bill overwhelmingly 402–12. The bill came to the Senate floor where it passed the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund through 2092, virtually funding health care for 9/11 victims and first responders for life.[216]The vote was 97–2 withRepublicansenatorsRand Paul(KY) andMike Lee(UT) opposing.[217]When hearing that the bill had been passed, Stewart responded by saying, "It has been the honor of my life working with the 9/11 first responders...these families deserve better...and I will follow you wherever your next adventure shall be."[218]
On September 30, 2021, Stewart debuted hisApple TV+show,The Problem with Jon Stewartby discussing the effects burn pits have had onveterans. Earlier in 2021, the billHonoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2021 (PACT Act)was introduced. TheHouse of Representativespassed the bill by 256–174 on March 3, 2022,[219][220]and passed theSenateby 84–14 on June 16, 2022.[221][222][223]The bill was reintroduced to the Senate for minor changes which Republican senators includingPat Toomey,Ted Cruz, andJosh Hawleyvoted against, putting the bill in jeopardy. Their opposition was the unfounded claim that the bill could be used as a slush fund.[224]
Stewart became a prominent advocate for the bill in person, onTwitterand on various cable news shows includingFox News'America's Newsroom with Bill Hemmer,CNN'sThe Lead with Jake Tapper,MSNBC'sMorning Joe, andNewsmax.[225][226][227]On July 28, 2022, Stewart held a press conference onCapitol Hillwhere he stated:
America's heroes, who fought in our wars, outside sweating their asses off…battling all kinds of ailments, while these motherfuckers sit in the air conditioning, walled off from any of it. They don't have to hear it, they don't have to see it. They don't have to understand that these are human beings…. I'm used to the lies, I'm used to the hypocrisy…. Senate is where accountability goes to die…. I'm used to all of it. But I am not used to cruelty.[228]

Lyonne has joked that her family consists of "my father's side,Flatbush, and my mother's side,Auschwitz".[2]Her grandmother, Ella,[15]came from a large family, but only she and her two sisters and two brothers survived, which Lyonne has attributed to their blond hair and blue eyes.[2]Lyonne's grandfather, Morris Buchinger, operated a watch company in Los Angeles. During the war, he hid in Budapest as a non-Jew working in a leather factory.[2]Lyonne lived the first eight years of her life inGreat Neck, New York.[10][16]She and her family emigrated to Israel, where she spent a year and a half. While in Israel, Lyonne participated in the 1989 Israeli children's filmApril Fool(Hebrew:אחד באפריל), which began her interest in acting.[7][17]Her parents divorced, and Lyonne and her older brother, Adam, returned to the United States with their mother.[10]After moving back to New York City, Lyonne attended theRamaz School, a private Jewish school,[18]where Lyonne was a scholarship student who tookTalmudclasses and readAramaic.[19]She was expelled in her sophomore year for selling marijuana to classmates.[19]Lyonne grew up on theUpper East Side, where she felt she was an outsider.[2]Her mother moved the family toMiamiand Lyonne briefly attendedMiami Country Day School.[20][21]She did not graduate from high school, leaving before her senior year to attend a film program atNew York University'sTisch School of the Arts, which she attended for a short time, studying film and philosophy.[16]Her high school graduation depended on completing her first year at Tisch, but she left the program because she could not pay the tuition.[8][22]

Of her time working as a child actor, Lyonne later said, "I had to become coherent and a businesswoman at six. By 10, I was a jaded professional … I don't think [my parents] knew better. It was a decision of [theirs] built on hopeful ignorance".[9]
After playing a supporting role as Polly inDennis the Menace(1993), Lyonne was cast at age 16 in theWoody Allen-directed musical comedyEveryone Says I Love You(1996), where she co-starred as D.J., the daughter of main character Joe (played by Allen). This led to a headline role in the independent coming-of-age comedySlums of Beverly Hills(1998), for which she received positive notices for her portrayal of Vivian Abromowitz.[26]Writing forThe Washington Post, Michael O'Sullivan said, "Lyonne is marvelous in conveying Vivian's combination of confusion, curiosity, disgust and desire at what body and psyche are going through. After playing a string of people's daughters [in other films], Lyonne really comes into her own here as an actress, registering as a person and not merely someone's little girl".[27]
In 1999, Lyonne starred as Megan Bloomfield, a sexually confused teenager, in the satirical romantic comedyBut I'm a Cheerleader. Despite a mixed critical reception upon release,[28]the film was instrumental in raising awareness of the harms ofconversion therapy,[29]and has since developed acult following.[30]In the same year, Lyonne played the small but crucial part of Jessica—a role she reprised in two of the film'ssequels—inAmerican Pie(1999),[31]which grossed over US$230 million at the box office.[32]Other film appearances in 1999 included Christine inDetroit Rock Cityand a headline role inFreeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby. The latter, a follow-up to the1996 original, was poorly received due to its violence and vulgarity,[33]but Lyonne's portrayal of teenage prostitute Crystal Van Meuther was praised for its "earthy, hard-boiled" nature.[34]
Lyonne played the part of Jeanne, a college activist fighting for lesbian equality, in the acclaimed 2000 television filmIf These Walls Could Talk 2.[35]She then appeared in the well-receivedHolocaustdramaThe Grey Zone(2001),[36]and continued to work steadily through the early 2000s, in mainstream projects such asScary Movie 2,Kate & Leopold(both 2001) andBlade: Trinity(2004), as well as smaller productions such asZig Zag(2002),Die, Mommie, Die!,Party Monster(both 2003),Madhouse(2004), andMy Suicidal Sweetheart(2005). Next, she headlined the 2009 experimental dark comedyThe Immaculate Conception of Little Dizzle, which was described as "relentlessly strange, courageous, and hyperactive" byThe Austin Chronicle.[37]Her portrayal of Debbie Tennis, a psychotic serial killer, in the 2010 horror parodyAll About Evilwas particularly well received, withFilm Threatcommenting, "[its director] rightfully treats Lyonne as the superstar she is, giving us glimpses of the dark residing in [her] that madeFreeway 2: Confessions of a Trick Baby[sic] the final cult masterpiece of the 20th century", noting that "her ability to unleash firehoses of ferocity is on full display here".[38]
Lyonne had a supporting role inAbel Ferrara's post-apocalyptic drama4:44 Last Day on Earth(2011), whichMovielinecalled "weirdly compelling".[39]Two years later, she began appearing on theNetflixcomedy-drama seriesOrange Is the New Black; her first television job as a series regular.[40]Critics were effusive about her portrayal of prison inmateNicky Nichols,[41][42][43]for which she received a nomination for the 2014Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series,[44]and was twice awarded—alongside her co-stars—theScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Ensemble in a Comedy Series(2015; 2017).
Lyonne's work as hard-partying Lou inAntibirth(2016), a psychedelic horror feature inspired by the films ofDavid Cronenberg,[45]drew special attention; Alex McLevy wrote in a review forThe A.V. Club, "The actor has experienced a remarkable resurgence in the past few years … Here, she channels her storied past to play Lou... drug-addled... plays to Lyonne's strengths—a bluntly outsized personality, brash but likable, with a self-destructive streak bigger than the podunk town in which the story unfolds".[46]Other film credits of hers includeSleeping with Other People,Hello, My Name Is Doris,Addicted to Fresno,Hashtag Horror(all 2015);Yoga Hosers,The Intervention(both 2016);Handsome(2017),Show Dogs(2018),Honey Boy(2019), andJames Gray's science fiction thrillerAd Astra(2019).

After battles with addiction and other health scares [in] the early-2000s, [Lyonne] has managed to revive her career … a personal narrative arc that clearly informs Nadia's constant brushes with her own mortality … Lyonne is such an idiosyncratic screen presence — not to mention so distinctly New York/Jewish/aggro — that most of the roles she's played, particularly as an adult, have barely bothered to delve beneath the surface of that persona … Nadia, on the other hand, is unmistakably Lyonne … It goes deeper and wider than anything she's gotten to play [since] her teenage days in indie films likeSlums of Beverly HillsandBut I'm a Cheerleader.[49]
Russian Dollhas had two seasons, earning Lyonne threePrimetime Emmynominations:Outstanding Comedy Series,Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, andOutstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.[50]

[As] much as I loveBette DavisandMae WestandGena Rowlands, I often found myself identifying with thePeter Falksand theJoe Pescisand theJimmy Cagneys—all the boys.

In a 2009 interview, Byrne said that her mother was anatheist, while both she and her father wereagnostic.[8]Her family was described byThe Telegraphas "close-knit", and frequently kept her grounded as her career took off. "At one point one of my sisters had a word with me saying, 'Watch yourself'", she once remarked. "But they were really supportive."[9]
Byrne attended Balmain Public School,[10]Australian Theatre for Young People(at age eight, encouraged by one of her sisters),[11]andHunters Hill High School[11]before attendingBradfield Senior College[12]for years 11 and 12.[13]She later lived in the Sydney suburbs ofNewtownandBondi.[14]Growing up, she experienced "plenty of rejection" from film schools. "I auditioned for a few of the big drama schools—Nepean,WAAPA,NIDA—and didn't get in to any of them. I was really disappointed with myself. I wasn't quite sure if I'd be legitimate without training for three years in a more traditional sense". Instead, she studied an arts degree atSydney University.
"I still have great memories of those days: studying, working, auditioning. Just being a jobbing actor trying to figure out life after high school".[15]In 1999, she studied acting at theAtlantic Theater Company, which was developed byDavid MametandWilliam H. Macy.

Byrne revealed in a post-award interview that, prior to winning the Venice Film Festival Award, she was surprised by her own performance and found it confronting watching the film because her acting was "too depressing". Byrne admitted that "watching myself is confronting because I'm convinced I can't act and I want to get out, that's how insecure I am."[5]
On stage, Byrne starred inLa Disputeand in a production ofAnton Chekhov's classicThree Sistersat theSydney Theatre Company.[16]In 2002, she appeared in a brief appearance asDormé, the handmaiden toNatalie Portman's SenatorPadmé Amidala, inGeorge Lucas'sStar Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones.

In the epic dramaTroy(2004), she took on the role ofBriseis, the captured priestess presented to "amuse"Brad Pitt'sAchilles.[17]Variety's review of the film stated: "Byrne's spoils-of-war chattel plays more as a convenient invention than as a woman who could possibly turn Achilles’ head and heart around".[18]In her other 2004 film release, the thrillerWicker Park, Byrne appeared, oppositeJosh HartnettandDiane Kruger, as the girlfriend of a young advertising executive's old friend.[19]Wicker ParkdirectorPaul McGuigandescribed her as the best actress he has worked with, and herTroyco-starPeter O'Tooledescribed her as "beautiful, uncomplicated, simple, pure actress and a very nice girl".[20]

A critically panned but commercially successful remake of the 1982 classic,Annie,[57]was released in December 2014 and featured Byrne playing the role of Grace Farrell, the titular character's mother figure and Mr. Stacks' faithful personal assistant.

The film was an arthouse success, withRotten Tomatoes' critical consensus reading: "Juliet, Naked's somewhat familiar narrative arc is elevated by standout work from a charming cast led by a well-matched Rose Byrne and Ethan Hawke."[57]I Am Mother(2019) is a thriller and sci-fi movie withClara Rugaardand Oscar winnerHilary Swank.

Since the beginning of her career, her performances have been acclaimed by critics.[65][66][67]In 2018, Byrne was noted for her comedic work.[68]She consciously made the transition to less dramatic material in the late 2000s, finding the idea of being "boxed in" to be "insufferable".[17]"You have to be aggressive in this business,” she noted. "You have always got to push for what you want. Working with Glenn [Close, onDamages], she was the hardest worker ever. She was constantly pushing".[17]Her turn to comedy led toThe Hollywood Reportercalling her "the most in-demand supporting actress for comedies".[69]Deciderwrote a story titled "How Did Rose Byrne Become One of Our Best Comedic Actresses?", in which it was remarked: "Byrne's emergence as one of the brightest stars in theApatowverseis all the more remarkable for her lack of a comedy background. [...] Any doubts about Byrne's massive comedic talent—and afterBridesmaidsandNeighbors, you'd have to be pretty stubborn to still have doubts—were put to rest with 2015'sSpy, where she again steals the show as merciless terrorist Rayna. Byrne and McCarthy's private-plane banter is the highlight of the film and could have gone on another 30 minutes as far as I'm concerned".[70]
In 2013, Byrne lived in New York and said she remained insecure about a stable career: "I don't think that insecurity ever leaves you. You're a freelancer. There's always an element of uncertainty."[4]Byrne has supportedUNICEFAustralia as the face of the 2007 Designers United campaign, and was a jury member ofTropfestin 2006 and Tropfest@Tribeca[71]in 2007.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
