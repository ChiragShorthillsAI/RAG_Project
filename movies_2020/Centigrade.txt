In 2002, a young American couple, Naomi and Matthew, travel to the arctic mountains of Norway. After pulling over during a snowstorm, they wake up trapped in their SUV, buried underneath layers of snow and ice. It is revealed that Naomi is eight months pregnant. They struggle to survive as the temperature drops to dangerous levels and they encounter unforeseen obstacles in their battle to stay alive. With few resources, a dwindling food supply, and nothing but time, tension, blame, and personal secrets bubble to the surface. Matthew and Naomi realize they must work together to survive in a crippling battle against the elements, hypothermia, disturbing hallucinations, and plunging temperatures.
After suffering a panic attack, Naomi goes into labor. Matt helps his wife with the delivery of their baby girl. Naomi suggests they name her Olivia (Liv for short) to which Matt agrees. Matt continues to suffer from hypothermia and frostbite while he is trying to dig through the window.
Naomi struggles to calm her newborn daughter, and Matt offers his coat to help keep the baby warm. The next morning, Naomi awakens to find Matt has died fromhypothermia. Days later, Naomi awakens with drops of water on her face. After checking the window, she discovers that the ice is finally soft enough to break through. She grabs her belongings, wraps up the baby, and manages to escape from the vehicle.
After hours of wandering in the wilderness, Naomi finally finds a remote hotel on the outskirts of civilization.
Before the credits roll, it is revealed that Naomi and Olivia were taken to a local hospital and treated for dehydration, hypothermia, frostbite, and severe malnourishment. Experts believe they survived due to the "igloo effect", shielding them from the elements and trapping in any heat they produced.
The original screenplay by Daley Nixon was based on the real-life case of Peter Skyllberg, a Swedish man who was pulled barely alive from his snow-covered car having survived on nothing but snow for two months in sub-zero temperatures.[9]The script was found and optioned through the website InkTip in 2017.[10]The film was shot in sequence. Both actors lost 20lbs during filming.[11]
Principal photography occurred inStaten IslandandNorwayin 2018 and 2019.[12][13]
According to star Vincent Piazza "They got two of the identical automobiles. They cut them in different ways so that they can move the camera in unique positions throughout the shoot to create a visual variety and they parked them in an ice cream freezer inStaten Island. They were able to control the temperature, so that was real. There were no gags or gimmicks. It was all real cold that we were enduring."[14]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
