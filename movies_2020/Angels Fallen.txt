A 1989 profile of actressSandy DennisinPeoplesays she had a live-in relationship with Roberts for five years in a seven-bedroom house she rented in Connecticut.[92]The relationship began several years after her 1974 parting from boyfriendGerry Mulligan, a jazz musician who had lived with Dennis in the same house (whose Connecticut location was identified asWestportorWiltonin differentPeoplemagazine articles).[92]
In 1981, some months after Roberts began living with Dennis, he was in a debilitating car accident near their home.[93]His ordeal was described byPeoplemagazine years later as "a month-long hospital stay after a bad car accident in 1981." Leaving the Wilton house he lived in with Dennis, Roberts went for a Jeep ride with his girlfriend'sGerman Shepherd. When the dog seemed to lean out too far, Roberts tried to get hold of him. He let go of the steering wheel, and the car ended up hitting a tree. He was in a coma for three days.[93]Dennis, an animal lover who cared for many dogs and cats, was relieved to learn her German Shepherd was not injured in the accident.[94]Roberts recovered and his live-in relationship with Dennis lasted a few more years. Author James Spada claimed that it came to an end because of his affair with actressEllen Barkin,[9]while Roberts cited Dennis' refusal to start an animal shelter for some 100 stray cats living in the couple's shared home as the reason for their split.[79]
Roberts broke off engagements with Dennis[95]and actressDana Wheeler-Nicholson.[93]He has a daughter,Emma, from a live-in relationship with Kelly Cunningham;[96]Emma was born on February 10, 1991.[96]She eventually became an actress as well, making her major-film debut at age 10 in the 2001 dramaBlow.[96]After Roberts' relationship with Cunningham, he marriedEliza Garrett(daughter of screenwritersDavid RayfielandLila Garrett) in 1992.[97][98]His stepson,Keaton Simons, is a singer-songwriter, and his stepdaughter, Morgan Simons, is a chef. Roberts became a grandfather for the first time in December 2020 when Emma gave birth to her first child, a son named Rhodes, with actorGarrett Hedlund.[99]
On January 12, 2001, Roberts visitedThe Howard Stern Radio Showwith Garrett, during a segment called "The Gossip Game" withMike Walkerof theNational Enquirer.He confirmed that he and his sister,Julia, had been estranged for several years. The source of the estrangement had been his past drug abuse and her siding with his ex-girlfriend over the custody of his daughter. In 2004, he toldPeoplemagazinethat he and his sister reconciled when he visited her in the hospital after she gave birth to twins.[100]
In December 1987, Roberts was arrested after police found him banging on a woman's apartment door in Manhattan'sUpper West Side. He was charged with criminal trespass, possession ofcocaineandmarijuana, and second-degree assault after he punched a police officer.[101]In February 1988, he pleaded guilty to harassment and was sentenced to six months on probation. His possession and assault charges were dropped.[102]
In February 1995, Roberts was arrested in Los Angeles for shoving his wifeElizainto a wall.[103]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
