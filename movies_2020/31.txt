Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesis an Americanfilm distributorwithin theDisney Entertainmentdivision ofthe Walt Disney Company.[5]It handles theatrical and occasional digital distribution, marketing, and promotion for films produced and released by theWalt Disney Studios, includingWalt Disney Pictures,Walt Disney Animation Studios,Pixar,Marvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures, though it operates its own autonomous theatrical distribution and marketing unit in the United States.[6]
The company was originally established byWalt Disneyin 1953 asBuena Vista Film Distribution Company Inc.(later renamedBuena Vista Distribution Inc.andBuena Vista Pictures Distribution Inc.). It took on its current name in late 2007.[7][8]
Before in 1953, Disney's productions were previously distributed by:
A dispute withRKO Picturesin 1953 over the distribution ofThe Living Desert, Disney's first full-length film in theTrue-Life Adventuresseries,[9]led Walt and his older brotherRoy O. Disneyto form its wholly owned subsidiary, the Buena Vista Film Distribution Company, Inc. (BVDC), to handle North American distribution of their own products.[7]RKO refused to distribute the film.[9]The name "Buena Vista" came from the eponymous street in Burbank, California, where theWalt Disney Studioswas located (and remains to this day). Buena Vista's first release was theAcademy Award-winning live-action featureThe Living Deserton November 10, 1953, along withToot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, Buena Vista's first animated release.[10]Notable subsequent releases included the Austrian filmVictoria in Dover, the JapaneseDaieifilmPrincess Yang Kwei Fei(Most Noble Lady), released in US theaters in September 1956,[11][12][13]The Missouri Travelerin March 1958,[10]andThe Big Fishermanin July 1959 (the first third-party production financed by Disney).[10]
By July 5, 1957,RKO Japan, Ltd.was sold to Disney Productions and British Commonwealth Film Corporation. In allocating the foreign film licenses to the company, Disney would use 5 and Commonwealth 8.[14]
In April 1960, the company dropped "Film" from its name.[8]In 1961, Disney incorporated Buena Vista International (BVI),[15]distributing its first PG-rated film,Take Down, in January 1979.[10]The low-budget movie was not produced by the Disney studios and was acquired from an independent studio, makingThe Black Holethe first PG-rated Disney film.[16]In late July 1990, Buena Vista changed its name to Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc. (BVPD).[8]
In the 1980s, Disney purchased a controlling stake in one ofPacific Theatres' chains[17]leading to Disney's Buena Vista Theaters and Pacific to renovate theEl Capitan Theatreand theCrestby 1989.[18]The Crest was finished first while El Capitan opened with the premiere ofThe Rocketeerfilm on June 19, 1991.[19]
In 1992, Buena Vista made production loans totaling $5.6 million toCinergi Picturesfor its filmMedicine Manand its 1994 filmsRenaissance ManandColor of Nightand were distributing Cinergi's films. The corporation purchased a 12.8% share in Cinergi with its initial public offering in 1994.[20]Soon, BVPD signed a 25 picture distribution deal with Cinergi.[21][22]
Gaumontand Disney formed Gaumont Buena Vista International, a joint venture in French distribution, in 1993.[23]In August 1996, Disney andTokuma ShotenPublishing agreed that Disney would distributeStudio Ghiblianimated films and provide 10% of the production cost of the studio's current in-production film,Spirited Away.[24][25][26]Disney would go on to produce the English dubs and distribute 15 of Ghibli's films, through theWalt Disney Pictures,Buena Vista Home Video,MiramaxandTouchstone Picturesbanners.[27]
In September 1996, following Disney's acquisition ofCapital Cities/ABC, Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc. was merged[8]into ABC, Inc.,[28]the parent company of that group.
For the November 1995 premiere ofToy Story, Disney rented theHollywood Masonic Temple—adjacent to the El Capitan Theatre—forTotally Toy Story, a multimediafunhouseand a promotional event for the movie.[29]On July 17, 1998, Buena Vista Pictures Distribution purchased theHollywood Masonic Templebuilding to continue using it as a promotional venue.[30]
By 1997, BVPD's share in Cinergi dropped to 5%. After nine films were delivered under the agreement, Cinergi sold on November 22, 1997 all of its 12-film library with the exception ofDie Hard with a Vengeanceto Disney, plus $20 million in exchange for Disney's Cinergi share holdings, production advances of $35.4 million and other loans.[22]In 2002, Disney signed a four animated film deal withVanguard Animation;[31]however,only one filmwas released under that negotiation.[32]
In 2004, BVI and Gaumont dissolved their French distribution joint venture, Gaumont Buena Vista International.[23]Buena Vista International agreed to a distribution deal with MegaStar Joint Venture Company Limited in April 2006 for the Vietnam market.[33]
On April 25, 2007, Disney discontinued the usage of theBuena Vistabrand in its distribution branding.[7]
In early 2009, Disney entered a distribution agreement with a reorganizedDreamWorks; the deal called for an estimated 30 films over a five-year period from DreamWorks and they would be released through the Touchstone banner.[34]In 2011,GKIDSacquired the North American theatrical distribution rights of the Ghibli films, withWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainmentretaining the home video rights until July 2017 whenShout! Factorytook over the home video rights. However, Disney only handles home video distribution of the company's films in Japan and formerly Taiwan and China.[35][36]
Disney's distribution deal with DreamWorks expired in August 2016, after the two studios decided to not renew their agreement on December 16, 2015, withUniversal Picturesreplacing Disney as DreamWorks' distributor.[37][38]By the end of the deal, Disney had distributed 14 of DreamWorks's original 30-picture agreement; thirteen through Touchstone and one throughWalt Disney Pictures.[39][40]Disney took complete ownership rights of those 14 DreamWorks films fromAmblin Partnersin exchange for loans made to that company.[41]The Light Between Oceans, the final film in that distribution deal, was also the last film released under Touchstone.
On December 14, 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced plans topurchase 21st Century Fox, which included20th Century FoxandFox Searchlight Pictures. On March 20, 2019, the acquisition of 21st Century Fox was completed.[42]Following the reorganization and renaming of the acquired film units, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures began distributing20th Century Studiosfilms in the United States, while Searchlight continued to operate their autonomous distribution unit.[43][6]
In late 2020 and early 2021, Disney reorganized the studio, placing it under theDisney Media and Entertainment Distributionunit which also oversees distribution toDisney+.[44]Under this structure, the Theatrical Distribution unit oversaw the domestic and international films produced by all the studios within the Walt Disney Studios umbrella.[45]In February 2023, returning CEO Bob Iger reversed this decision and reorganized the studio again, returning it as a division under the purview ofThe Walt Disney Studios.
Walt Disney Studios has produced or distributed 36 films that have received nominations for theAcademy Award for Best Picture: fifteen from its formerMiramaxdivision,[46]six from bothTouchstone PicturesandSearchlight Pictures,[a]four fromWalt Disney Pictures, three from20th Century Studios,[b]two fromHollywood Pictures, and one fromMarvel Studios.[46][48][49][50]Of those nominated films, five films—Miramax'sThe English Patient,Shakespeare in Love,Chicago,No Country for Old Men, and Searchlight'sNomadland—have won Best Picture.[46][51][52]
Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures currently distributes films from across all units ofWalt Disney Studioswith the exception ofSearchlight Pictures, which maintains its own autonomous distribution and marketing operations for releases in the United States and select markets.[43][6]In addition,20th Century Studios’s distribution unit merged in Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures in 2020 but retains its own label as the distributor name.

In 1992, Disney opted to end their joint venture with Warner Bros. to start autonomously distributing their films in these aforementioned overseas markets beginning withAladdin, inspiring Warner Bros. to establish theFamily Entertainmentlabel to self-distribute family-friendly films under the Warner umbrella at the same period. In those territories from 1993 to 2007, Disney reactivated the Buena Vista International name, and also sent distribution under it in countries that did not have any current arrangements with other companies.[citation needed]Disney would then continue its overseas film distribution relationship with Warner Bros. through a home video distribution deal in Europe and Australia in whichWarner Home Videodistributed select Disney material on DVD from 1999 to 2002, when Disney opted to self-distribute DVDs in these aforementioned territories.
Italia Film, aLebanesefilm distribution and production company, is Disney's exclusive theatrical film distribution partner for various Middle East and North Africa (MENA) markets since 1993, after making a deal directly with Buena Vista International at the time.

Disney andSony Picturesformed in 1997 a film distribution joint venture in Southeast Asia.[84]By December 2006, 14 joint distribution ventures with Sony Pictures Releasing International were formed and exist in countries includingBrazil,Mexico,Singapore,Thailandand thePhilippines. In January 2007, their fifteenth such partnership began operations inRussiaandCIS.[85]In February 2017, Sony starting leaving the Southeast Asia venture with the Philippines. On August 14, 2017, Sony terminated the joint venture agreement for their own operations.[84]On January 31, 2019, in anticipation of thethen-pending acquisitionof the most21st Century Foxassets (which includes 20th Century Fox), Disney agreed to sell its stake in the Mexican joint venture named Walt Disney Studios Sony Pictures Releasing de México toSony Pictures Releasing.[86]
InGreeceandCyprus, Disney's movies are distributed through local distributor Feelgood Entertainment, which also distributes Sony Pictures films in those territories.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
