The Huntis a 2020 Americanactionhorror film[a]directed byCraig Zobeland written by Nick Cuse andDamon Lindelof. The film starsBetty Gilpin,Hilary Swank,Ike Barinholtz, andEmma Roberts.Jason Blumwas a producer under hisBlumhouse Productionsbanner, along with Lindelof.[4]Zobel and Lindelof have said that the film is intended as asatireon the profound political divide between the Americanleftandright.[5]It is about a group of elites who kidnap working class people to hunt them.
The film was first announced in March 2018, and the cast signed on a year later. Filming took place inNew Orleans. The film was originally scheduled for release on September 27, 2019. However, as a result of theEl PasoandDaytonmass shootingsin early August 2019,Universal Picturesdecided to delay it.
The Huntwas released in theaters in the United States on March 13, 2020, byUniversal Picturesand received mixed reviews from critics. The onset of theCOVID-19 pandemicresulted in the closure of most theaters within a week of the film's release, which resulted in the film underperforming at the box office, grossing only $12.4 million. Universal madeThe Huntavailable digitally on March 20.
In a group chat, Athena Stone, Ted, Richard, Miranda, Julius, Peter, Martin, Mike and Liberty discuss an upcoming hunt of "deplorables" at a manor.
Later, on Athena's private jet, a flight attendant talks to Richard but is interrupted by Randy, who staggers out from the cargo hold. Ted claims to be a doctor and subdues Randy before Athena kills him.
As the hunt begins, eleven captives consisting of Crystal, Don, Gary, "Yoga Pants", "Target", "Dead Sexy", "Staten Island", "Vanilla Nice", "Big Red", "Trucker" and "Bandana Man" wake up in a forest, with gags locked in their mouths. Crystal leaves while the rest go into a field and find a crate, containing a pig and a cache of weapons. Yoga Pants finds the keys to their gags. A rifle is fired at them, killing Yoga Pants. Bandana Man fights back but is also shot and killed. Dead Sexy falls into a spike pit and impales herself. Trucker steps onto a land mine, instantly killing him. Severely injured, Dead Sexy kills herself. Staten Island, Target, Vanilla Nice, and Big Red escape the killing field by climbing a barbed wire fence. Target is shot with an arrow and subsequently killed with a grenade. The other three find a service station, whose owners tell them they are inArkansas. They realize their situation's similarity to the "Manorgate"conspiracy theoryafter discovering each was kidnapped from a different part of the country.
Big Red eats a poisoned doughnut, and the owners of the service station (Miranda and Julius) kill Staten Island with ashotgunwhile Vanilla Nice is suffocated with poison gas. They then clean up the station. Crystal arrives and after purchasing cigarettes, notes that they are too expensive for the region, takes the shotgun from under the counter and kills Julius and Miranda.
Inspecting the pickup truck outside and removing fake license plates, Crystal learns she is inCroatia. She also discovers a booby-trap wired to the driver's-side door and warns Gary, a conspiracy theorist podcaster. They board a train full of refugees, whom Gary believes to becrisis actors; the train is then raided byCroatian soldiers. When Gary tries to convince them of Manorgate and the refugees' perfidy, refugee "Crisis Mike" admits that he is indeed one of the hunters but the other refugees are innocent. The raid was unplanned, and he offers a head start for Gary's cooperation. Gary wrests a grenade from Mike and uses it to kill him. Crystal is taken to a refugee camp where she meets Don. Oliver, an envoy from the Croatian U.S. Embassy, arrives to extract them but during the drive Crystal becomes suspicious of his comments, kicks Oliver out of the car and runs him over.
She and Don find Gary's body in the trunk with a box marked "bribe money" and a map. Crystal tells Don the story of "the Jackrabbit and the Box Turtle", in which the Jackrabbit kills the Box Turtle after losing a race with him.[b]At Oliver's intended destination, Crystal kills Richard, Ted, Martin, Peter, Liberty, and injures their tactical consultant Sgt. Dale. Athena calls out to Don via radio, asking if he killed Crystal. Don refuses to disarm aiming his gun at Crystal, who kills him. She tortures Sgt. Dale to get Athena's location - revealing during their exchange that she previouslyserved in Afghanistan- then kills him. In reality, Athena's group text exchange was a joke. However, it was leaked on the internet, creating furor over "Manorgate". Subsequently, the group's participants, whose careers were ruined, decide to make Manorgate a reality and abduct those responsible for spreading the conspiracy theory.
Athena had insisted that Crystal be included after seeing a social media post from Crystal that offended her. When they confront each other, Crystal claims that Athena has confused her with another woman from the same city in Mississippi, with a differently spelled middle name, Mae. The two fight and impale one another on the blades of a food processor; Athena dies, but Crystal sees ajackrabbitnear the body and regains some strength. She cauterizes her wound, takes Athena's clothes and bag, and leaves on her jet, talking to the same flight attendant from the start of the film.
In March 2018,Universal Picturesacquired the rights to the film, and setCraig Zobelto direct it, from a script by Nick Cuse andDamon Lindelof.[6][7]The original title of the script was initially reported asRed State Vs. Blue State, a reference to thered states and blue states.[4]Later, Universal issued a statement denying that the film had ever had it as itsworking title.[8]The elite hunters' reference to their quarry as "deplorables" is an allusion to the phrase "basket of deplorables," used byHillary Clintonduring the2016 United States presidential electioncampaign to refer to half of the supporters of then-presidential candidateDonald Trump.[9]An early draft of the script depicted working class conservatives as the film's heroes.[8]
In March 2019,Emma Roberts,Justin Hartley,Glenn Howerton,Ike Barinholtz, andBetty Gilpinwere announced as being cast in the film.[10][11][12]In April 2019,Amy Madigan, Jim Klock, Charli Slaughter, Steve Mokate, and Dean West were added as well.[13][14]Hilary Swank's casting was announced in July.[15]

The Huntwas theatrically released in the United States on March 13, 2020, by Universal Pictures. It was originally scheduled for release on September 27, 2019. It was, for a time, moved back to October 18, 2019, before shifting back to September 27.[18]On August 7, 2019, Universal announced that in the wake of theDaytonandEl Pasomass shootings, they would be suspending the film's promotional campaign.[19]Several days later, the film was pulled from the studio's release schedule.[20][21]
In February 2020, the studio announced that the film would be released on March 13, 2020 (Friday the 13th) in the U.S., with a new trailer, partially in response to the success of the similarly controversial filmJoker.[5][22][23]Producer Jason Blum stated in an interview that "not one frame was changed" since the delay and that it was "exactly the same movie".[24]
In mid-March 2020,movie theatersbegan to close because of theCOVID-19 pandemiclockdown measures.[25]Three days after the film's release, on March 16, 2020, Universal Pictures announced that the film would be availabledigitallythroughPremium VODin the United States and Canada on March 20, before the end of the usual 90-day theatrical run.[26]This was also the case for the studio's other films such asThe Invisible ManandTrolls World Tour.[27][28]
The film was released in threeSantikos Entertainmenttheater locations inSan Antonio, Texas on May 1, 2020, after the chain reopened.[29]
The Hollywood Reporterwrote that there were a pair of test screenings for the film which garnered "negative reactions". The second screening was held on August 6, 2019, in Los Angeles, in which "audience members were again expressing discomfort with the politics" of it, an issue Universal had not foreseen (although other studios had initially passed on the script for that reason). In a statement toVariety, Universal pushed back on a report that test audiences had been uncomfortable with the film's political slant, and also countered claims that the script had originally had an explicitly political title.[30]
The film's trailer received backlash by some in theconservative mediafor portraying supporters ofDonald Trumpbeing hunted by liberals.[31]Trump also issued atweeton August 9, 2019, criticizing the film industry while stating, "The movie coming out is made in order to inflame and cause chaos"; although Trump did not specify the name of the film, news outlets said it was most likely a reference toThe Hunt.[31][32][33]Kyle Smith, writing in theNational Review, argued that the film has aright-wing, anti-liberaltone that had been misinterpreted by conservative critics of the film's trailer.[34]
In an interview withThe Guardian, director Craig Zobel stated he did not make the film in order to create controversy.[35]
The Huntgrossed $5.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $6.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $12.4 million.[2][3]
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongsideBloodshotandI Still Believe, and was projected to gross $8–11 million from 3,028 theaters in its opening weekend.[36][37]The film made $2.2 million on its first day, including $435,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $5.3 million, finishing fifth. The weekend was also noteworthy for being the lowest combined grossing since October 1998, with all films totaling just $55.3 million, in large part due to societal restrictions and regulations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[38]With the closure of many theaters due toCOVID-19, the film played almost exclusively atdrive-in theatersin the following weeks; it made $279,500 in its 11th weekend and $217,500 in its 12th weekend.[39][40]
Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 57% based on 276 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critics consensus read, "The Huntis successful enough as a darkly humorous action thriller, but it shoots wide of the mark when it aims for timely social satire."[41]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[42]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale.[38]
The movie has been described as a "looseriffonRichard Connell’s short story 'The Most Dangerous Game'".[45][46]The characters themselves allude toGeorge Orwell'sAnimal Farm, with the main antagonist referring to the main protagonist asSnowball.[45]

Damon Laurence Lindelof(born April 24, 1973) is an American screenwriter, comic book writer, and producer. Among his accolades, he received threePrimetime Emmy Awards, from twelve nominations. In 2010,Timemagazine named him one of the100 most influential people in the world.[2]
Lindelof is best known as the creator and showrunner of numerous critically acclaimed television series, such as theABCscience fiction drama seriesLost(2004–2010), theHBOsupernatural drama seriesThe Leftovers(2014–2017), the HBO superhero limited seriesWatchmen(2019), and thePeacockscience fiction limited seriesMrs. Davis(2023).
Lindelof was also a writer on theCBScrime drama seriesNash Bridges(2000–2001) and theNBCcrime drama seriesCrossing Jordan(2001–2004). He co-wrote the filmsCowboys & Aliens(2011),Prometheus(2012),Star Trek Into Darkness(2013),World War Z(2013), andTomorrowland(2015).
Lindelof was born inEnglewood, New Jersey, the son of Susan (Klausner), a teacher, and David Herbert Lindelof, a bank manager.[3][4]Lindelof's mother isAshkenazi Jewish, with family fromBiałystok,Poland. His father's ancestry included Swedish (where his Lindelof great-grandfather was born, in Välinge,Malmöhus), Norwegian, Spanish, and German.[1][5][6][7]Lindelof celebrated hisBar Mitzvahin Teaneck, where he attendedsynagogue.[8]
Lindelof went toTeaneck High School, a school whose diverse student body he credits with expanding his horizons as a writer.[9]He has stated, "I was a Jewish white kid growing up in Teaneck, but at the same time, I had African and Filipino and Asian friends and to have that experience all through high school while getting an awesome education was wonderful."[8]He attended film school atNew York University, performing briefly in the band Petting Zoo, and moved to Los Angeles after graduating.
An early boost to Lindelof's writing career came in 1999, when he was selected as a semifinalist for a Nicholl Fellowship for his screenplayPerfectionists.[10]Before this, he had worked on reviewing scripts atParamount,Fox, andAlan Laddstudios.
In 1999, Lindelof began his professional career as a writer on the drama seriesWastelandand the anthology seriesUndressed. He received further attention as a writer on theCBScrime drama seriesNash Bridges, which he worked on from 2000 to 2001. He then wrote and produced theNBCcrime drama seriesCrossing Jordan, which he worked on until the end of its third season.
In 2004, Lindelof received further recognition and success as an executive producer andshowrunner(alongsideCarlton Cuse) on the drama seriesLost. The series was praised for its unique brand of storytelling and strong characters. The first two seasons of the show were ratings juggernauts and the show never fell out of theTop 30throughout its six seasons on the air. Lindelof's work onLostgarnerednumerous awards and nominationsthroughout its run, including winning thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Seriesin 2005.[11]
Lindelof and theLostwriting staff won theWriters Guild of America Awardfor Best Dramatic Series at theFebruary 2006 ceremonyfor their work on thefirstandsecondseasons.[12]He was nominated for the WGA Award for Best Dramatic Series a further three times: namely, theFebruary 2007 ceremonyfor his work on the second andthirdseasons,[13]at theFebruary 2009 ceremonyfor his work on thefourth season[14]and at theFebruary 2010ceremony for his work on thefifth season.[15]Lindelof and his co-writerDrew Goddardwere also nominated for the WGA Award for Best Episodic Drama at theFebruary 2008 ceremonyfor writing the episode "Flashes Before Your Eyes".[16]
Lindelof and co-showrunner Carlton Cuse have been heralded as two of the first to truly embrace the changing times with things such as their daily podcast and being active in the fan community. A majority of the six seasons were met with critical praise, but both Lindelof and Cuse were not afraid to address critiques on the show, be it through the podcast or other forms of media. However, Lindelof said in late 2013 that he would no longer be addressing those displeased with the way the show ended, stating:
And what do I do? I jump at the opportunity to acknowledge how many people were dissatisfied with how it ended. I try to be self-deprecating and witty when I do this, but that's an elaborate (or obvious?) defense mechanism to let people know I'm fully aware of the elephant in the room and I'm perfectly fine with it sitting down on my face and shitting all over me ... And here's my part: I will finally stop talking about it. I'm not doing this because I feel entitled or above it — I'm doing it because I accept that I will not change hearts nor minds. I will not convince you they weren't dead the whole time, nor resent you for believing they were despite my infinite declarations otherwise.[17]
Lindelof was featured on a December 2008 episode ofThe Write Environment, a public television series featuring in-depth, candid one-on-one interviews with some of TV's most prolific and well-known series creator and writers. The interview is also available on DVD.[18][19]
While approaching the end ofLost, it was rumored that Lindelof and J. J. Abrams would write and direct a film adaptation of Stephen King'sThe Dark Towerseries. Lindelof dismissed this in a Q&A withUSA Todayin late 2009. He commented, "After working six years onLost, the last thing I want to do is spend the next seven years adapting one of my favorite books of all time. I'm such a massive Stephen King fan that I'm terrified of screwing it up. I'd do anything to see those movies written by someone else. My guess is they will get made because they're so incredible. But not by me."[20]Lindelof later served as co-producer on the 2009 science fiction action film,Star Trek, which was directed by frequent collaborator J. J. Abrams.
In May 2023, Lindelof and Cuse were accused of fostering a "toxic workplace" by several cast members and writers during their tenure onLost. In an excerpt from the bookBurn It Down: Power, Complicity, and a Call for Change in Hollywood, authorMaureen Ryaninterviewed various actors, writers, and crew members from the series on the alleged toxicity behind the scenes. Multiple sources claimed that Lindelof had said about the departure ofHarold Perrineaufrom the series that the actor "called me racist, so I fired his ass."[21]Lindelof responded to the allegations by saying, "I have no recollection of those specific things. And that's not me saying that they didn't happen. I'm just saying that it's literally baffling my brain—that they did happen and that I bore witness to them or that I said them. To think that they came out of my mouth or the mouths of people that I still consider friends is just not computing."[18]Lindelof acknowledged personal failings during his time as showrunner onLost, saying "My level of fundamental inexperience as a manager and a boss, my role as someone who was supposed to model a climate of creative danger and risk-taking but provide safety and comfort inside of the creative process—I failed in that endeavor" and "I have significantly evolved and grown, and it shouldn't have had to come at the cost and the trauma of people that I hurt onLost."[18]
In 2011, Lindelof aided in development of the fantasy seriesOnce Upon a Time, which was created by formerLostwritersEdward KitsisandAdam Horowitz. He was not officially credited in the pilot.[22]Also in 2011, Lindelof,Alex Kurtzman, andRoberto Orci, and several other writers, contributed to the screenplay of thefilm versionof the comic book seriesCowboys & Aliens.
Lindelof co-wrote the screenplay for Ridley Scott's science fiction filmPrometheus, which was released in June 2012 to commercial success. Lindelof also produced the 2013 science fiction action sequel,Star Trek Into Darkness, and cowrote its screenplay with Kurtzman and Orci. Also that year, he co-wrote the screenplay for the action adventure filmWorld War Z.
He co-wrote the screenplay for the science fiction adventure filmTomorrowlandwith directorBrad Bird, based on a story by Lindelof, Bird, andJeff Jensen. The film was in development for many years before being released in 2015.[23][24]
In 2014, Lindelof co-created theHBOsupernatural drama seriesThe LeftoverswithTom Perrotta, based on Perrotta'snovel of the same name.[25][26]He also served as showrunner and executive producer throughout the show's three seasons.[27]The series received widespread critical acclaim. Many critics referred toThe Leftoversas one of the greatest television series of all time,[28][29][30][31][32]with particular praise for its writing, directing, acting and thematic depth. Despite receiving averageNielsen ratingsthroughout its run, the series has developed acult following.[33][34][35]
In August 2018, it was announced that Lindelof would be adaptingAlan Moore'sWatchmenas a series for HBO. He had previously been quoted as saying it was his favorite graphic novel and a huge inspiration onLost.[36]The series, which features an original story set after the events of the graphic novel, premiered in 2019 to critical acclaim. Onreview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the series has a 95% rating based on 112 reviews, with an average rating of 8.58/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Bold and bristling,Watchmenisn't always easy viewing, but by adding new layers of cultural context and a host of complex characters it expertly builds on its source material to create an impressive identity of its own."[37]While HBO had not confirmed a second season following the show's broadcast, Lindelof stated that if there were, he would not likely be back for it, but instead have another producer step forward to tell another story set in this universe. Lindelof said he felt that the show was "not my story" and that "These nine episodes are sort of everything that I have to say at this point aboutWatchmen".[38]
In 2019, Lindelof joined a host of other writers in firing their agents as part of theWGA'sstand against theATAand the practice ofpackaging.[39]
In 2020, Lindelof wrote and produced the horror thriller filmThe Hunt. The film attracted some media controversy for its political subject matter,[40]and received mixed reviews upon release. After a wide release run for almost a week, COVID-19 regulations forced theaters to close, and the film subsequently played almost exclusively at drive-ins.[41]
In 2022, Lindelof was announced as a writer of an upcomingStar Warsmovie withSharmeen Obaid-Chinoyset to direct.[42]He turned in a draft and left the project in 2023 withSteven Knightreplacing him.[43][44]
In 2024, Lindelof along with Chris Mundy andTom Kingwrote the pilot script and series bible forDC Universe(DCU) seriesLanterns,confirmed by co-CEO ofDC StudiosJames Gunn[45]
Lindelof is the writer of the six-issue comic-book miniseriesUltimate Wolverine vs. HulkforMarvel Comics, which takes place in theUltimate Marveluniverse.[46]It began publication in January 2006. Production was suspended after the second issue in February 2006 due to Lindelof's heavy workload elsewhere. The last of the scripts was submitted to Marvel in 2008 and the series resumed publication in March 2009.
He also wrote the first issue of the comic book seriesLegends of the Dark Knight(Vol. 2), published byDC comics, in June 2012.
Lindelof wrote aRip Hunterstory forTime WarpNo. 1 (May 2013) which was drawn byJeff Lemireand published byVertigo.[47][48]
Lindelof frequently collaborates with a tightly knit group of film professionals which includeJ. J. Abrams,Adam Horowitz,Alex Kurtzman,Roberto Orci,Edward Kitsis,Andre Nemec,Josh Appelbaum,Jeff Pinkner, andBryan Burk.[6]
Lindelof is a self-professedStephen Kingfan and has placed many references to King's work intoLost, as well as mentioning within theOfficial Lost PodcastthatThe Standserves as a huge influence. Lindelof has been quoted as saying that thegraphic novelWatchmen, written byAlan Moore, is the greatest piece of popular fiction ever produced, and its effect onLostis evident many times in the show. He has also mentionedDavid Lynch'sTwin Peaksas a big influence forLost.[49]
J. J. Abramshad often cited Patrick McGoohan's similarly allegorical sci-fi/spy seriesThe Prisoneras another major influence onLost. Lindelof lists his favorite six films, in no particular order, asTouch of Evil,Raiders of the Lost Ark,Pulp Fiction,The Shining,Bambi, andThe Godfather Part II.[50]Lindelof is a fan of the television seriesThe Wire,Breaking Bad, andBattlestar Galactica.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
