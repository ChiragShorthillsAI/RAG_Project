Cassie Thomas is a 30-year-old medical school dropout who works in a coffee shop and spends her evenings going to bars and clubs and pretending to be drunk, then confronting those who attempt to take sexual advantage of her intoxication. It is slowly revealed that Cassie quit medical school after the public rape of her lifelong best friend, Nina Fisher, who subsequently dropped out and committed suicide when her alleged rapist, Al Monroe, was cleared of wrongdoing.
Cassie becomes reacquainted with Ryan Cooper, a former medical school classmate, who persuades her to go on a date. Ryan reveals that Al will soon get married. Angered that he has found success and happiness, while Nina is dead, Cassie begins to orchestrate revenge against the people that she thinks contributed to nobody being held accountable for the rape.
First, Cassie meets with Madison McPhee, another former classmate and a friend of hers and Nina's, who blames Nina for her own assault because she often drank to excess, adding, "What did she think was going to happen?" Cassie plies Madison with wine and hires a man to take her to a hotel room to trick her into thinking she was raped. Madison later leaves Cassie multiple distressed voicemails.
Cassie then targets Elizabeth Walker, the dean who dismissed Nina's case. Pretending to be a makeup artist for a popular band, she lures Walker's daughter into her car. She meets with Walker under the guise of returning to medical school, and finds that the dean only vaguely remembers Nina's case and even had Al return to give a talk at the school recently. Walker justifies her actions until Cassie tells her that she has just dropped her daughter off in the dorm room where Nina was raped. Terrified, Walker demands to know where her daughter is, finally admitting her own complicity and inaction before Cassie admits she is safe nearby.
Next, Cassie meets with Al's lawyer, Jordan Green, and finds that he is deeply remorseful for his actions. Jordan, who is on a leave of absence after a nervous breakdown, describes how easy it is to build a case against a rape victim. Cassie chooses to forgive him, and later visits Nina's mother, who encourages her to move on with her life.
Cassie reconnects with Ryan. They begin dating and fall in love. She also introduces Ryan to her parents, who are happy that their daughter seems to finally be moving on.
A distressed Madison confronts Cassie at home, who assures her that she was not actually raped. Madison admits her complicity and provides a phone containing a video of Nina's rape, revealing Ryan's presence at the party. Cassie confronts Ryan, who claims he was too drunk to remember the incident and should be forgiven as he was so young. Threatening to release the video, Cassie forces Ryan to reveal Al's bachelor party location. He begs for her forgiveness, but she refuses and they part acrimoniously.
Posing as astripperat the party, Cassie drugs the attendees, handcuffs Al to a bed, and reveals her identity. Cassie attempts to carve Nina's name upon Al's body, but he overpowers her and suffocates her with a pillow. The next morning, Al's friend Joe helps him burn Cassie's body in the woods. Cassie's parents report hermissing. A police officer questioning Ryan asks him if Cassie was mentally unstable and if he believes she might hurt herself, which he affirms.
At Al's wedding, Ryan is stunned to receive a scheduled text from Cassie, indicating that her plan is not finished. The police arrive at the reception to arrest Al for her murder. Flashbacks reveal that Jordan had received a package with the cell phone and instructions in case Cassie did not return from the bachelor party. The police had discovered a half-heart necklace with Nina's name on it in Cassie's burnt remains. Al is arrested for Cassie's death as Ryan receives a final text from Cassie, signed with her and Nina's names.

Emerald Fennell devised the concept of the film in 2017, and sold the script toMargot Robbie's production companyLuckyChap Entertainmentafterpitchingthe opening scene.[10]In January 2019, it was announcedCarey Mulliganhad been set to star in the film, with Fennell directing.[11]In March 2019,Bo Burnham,Alison Brie,Connie Britton,Adam Brody,Jennifer Coolidge,Laverne Cox,Max Greenfield,Christopher Mintz-Plasse,Sam Richardson, andMolly Shannonjoined the cast,[12]with Angela Zhou andClancy Brownbeing added in April.[13][14]Principal photography began in Los Angeles on March 26, 2019,[15]lasting 23 days.[16]The majority of exterior shots were filmed at Campus South, part of theLanterman propertyatCal Poly Pomona.[17]
The film production crew deliberately chose male actors who previously played characters known as good or wholesome to reinforce the idea that predators can be anyone.[18]
Fennell created "mood boards" to illustrate to the crew how Cassie has wildly different facets of her personality.[19]
In the first draft of the script, Fennell planned to end the film at the time Cassie's body was burned, but the production's financiers balked at having a negative ending. Prior to writing the script, Fennell initially considered an ending where Cassie appears at the wedding and kills the men responsible, but she deemed it unrealistic. She decided to have the ending where Cassie has a backup revenge plan as she felt Cassie would be thorough in her planning and she would be aware she could die. Additionally, Fennell stated that having Al apprehended at his wedding would reflect Cassie's sense of humor.[20]
The production had a budget around $10 million.[3][4]
In February 2019,Focus Featuresacquired distribution rights to the film for the world excluding  Australia, New Zealand, the Benelux, Israel, Greece, Middle East, the CIS, and South Africa.[21]It had its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 25, 2020.[22]It was initially scheduled to be released theatrically on April 17, 2020,[23]but was pulled from the schedule due to the initial closures of movie theaters that occurred during theCOVID-19 pandemic.[24]It was theatrically released on December 25, 2020, instead,[25]and onvideo on demandon January 15, 2021.[26][27]TheBlu-raywas released on March 16, 2021.[28]

Domestically, the film was released alongsideWonder Woman 1984,News of the World, andPinocchio, and was projected to gross around $2 million in its opening weekend.[29]It went on to debut to $719,305, finishing fifth at the box office. Some 63% of the audience were female, and 74% were aged over 25.[30]The film dropped 4.4% in its second weekend to $687,900, then made $586,285 in its third weekend, finishing sixth both times.[31][32]The film continued to hold well in the subsequent weekends, including seeing a 16% bump following its four Golden Globe nominations, with a running total of $5.1 million by February 21.[33]
Promising Young Womanreceived highly positive reviews from critics.[34][35]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 90% of 427 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's consensus reads: "A boldly provocative, timely thriller,Promising Young Womanis an auspicious feature debut for writer-director Emerald Fennell – and a career highlight for Carey Mulligan."[36]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 72 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[37]Audiences surveyed byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled byPostTrakgave it a 73% overall positive score, with 43% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[30]
Kate Erbland ofIndieWiregave the film a "B+" and wrote, "Emerald Fennell's raucous debut,Promising Young Woman, twists its buzzword-laden, spoiler-free synopsis—it's a#MeToorape revenge thrillerwith bite!—into something fresh and totally wild."[38]Writing for theLos Angeles Times,Justin Changsaid, "The grimly multitasking finale ofPromising Young Womanfeels both audacious and uncertain of itself, as Fennell tries to meld a cackle of delight and a blast of fury, with a lingering residue of anguish. It doesn't all come together, though there's an undeniable thrill in seeing it come apart."[39]Linda HolmesofNPRwrote that while Cassie is the film's focus, "Fennell is saying something here, too, about men. About nice men and about men who think they're nice men, or nice enough men."[40]
InVariety, Dennis Harvey praised Mulligan's performance as "skillful, entertaining and challenging", but questioned her casting, writing that she wore her "pickup-bait gear like bad drag; even her long blonde hair seems a put-on". He speculated that producer Margot Robbie may have once been intended for the role instead. Mulligan criticized the comment, saying, "I felt like it was basically saying that I wasn't hot enough to pull off this kind of ruse ... For this film, you're going to write something that is so transparent? Now? In 2020? I just couldn't believe it."Varietyissued an apology, saying the review had been insensitive and "minimized" her "daring performance".[41]TheNational Society of Film Criticsdefended Harvey's review and criticizedVariety's apology. Harvey responded to Mulligan's comments inThe Guardian:"I didnotsay or even mean to imply Mulligan is 'not hot enough' for the role." He pointed out that he was a 60-year-old gay man and did not "go around dwelling on the comparative hotnesses of young actresses".[42]
Aisha HarrisofNPRstated that Cassie does not get satisfaction from her acts of revenge, something differing from characters in other thrillers where characters take revenge.[43]A. A. Dowd ofThe A.V. Clubstated that Ryan Cooper initially is contrasted with predatory men and "represents the possibility of forgiveness, a light at the end of the dark tunnel [Cassie has] been traveling through since college."[44][45]In regards to why Ryan chooses to cover for his friends when the police interview him, Fennell said: "Hesowants to be good. But he's not going to blow up his own life."[20]In regards to the reveal showing his true character, Dowd said: "Even those who didn't participate are complicit for their silence, their justifications, their refusal to intervene."[44]Dowd added that the casting of Burnham, who "comes across as nonthreatening" and has "a boyish quality", assisted the use of the character.[44]Harris stated thatChristopher Mintz-Plasse's portrayal of Neil had "just the right amount of creepy, entitled energy."[43]
Promising Young Womanwas nominated for five categories at the93rd Academy Awardsand wonBest Original Screenplay.[46]This film was longlisted in 13 categories at the74th British Academy Film Awards, including Best Director for Fennell, Best Actress for Mulligan, and Best Supporting Actor for Burnham.[47]It was finalized at six categories and won two awards, forBest Original ScreenplayandOutstanding British Film.[48]It was nominated for four categories at the78th Golden Globe Awards,[49]and six at the26th Critics' Choice Awards.[50]It wonBest Actressfor Mulligan andBest Original Screenplayfor Fennell.[50]It further received aScreen Actors Guild Awardsnomination,[51]and fourAACTA Awardsnomination, winningBest International FilmandBest International Actressfor Mulligan.[52]Most of the awards were directed to Mulligan and Fennell, for the performances, screenplay as well as direction, respectively.

Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]

The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
