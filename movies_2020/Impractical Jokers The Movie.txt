The film starsBrian Quinn,James Murray,Sal Vulcano, andJoe Gatto, also known asThe Tenderloins. It was theatrically released on February 21, 2020. The film received generally unfavorable reviews, but grossed $10 million against a budget of $3 million.
In 1994Staten Island, a group of four teenage friends,Joe Gatto,Sal Vulcano,James MurrayandBrian Quinnsneak into aPaula Abdulconcert disguised as security personnel. However, they accidentally ruin the concert after Joe jumps out on stage and poorly acts as ahype man. The outcome embarrasses them and angers Abdul, who delivers aclothesline blowto Sal and vows to get her revenge on the Jokers. However, the incident inspires them to do practical joke challenges as a comedy gimmick.
Twenty-five years later in 2019, the four have become famous celebrities as a result of their TV show,Impractical Jokers, but are surprised to see Abdul at aRed Lobster. Abdul approaches but admits that she is a huge fan of the show, and invites them to a party inMiami. However, shortly after Paula leaves, the group realizes she gave them only three tickets instead of four, meaning that one person will not be able to go. In order to decide who will be left out, they decide toroad tripto Miami using Q'sCrown Vic.[4]while competing with each other in hidden-camera challenges; the one who loses will not get the ticket.
Some of the major challenges include: reading aeulogyto folks outside theLincoln MemorialinWashington, D.C.and getting the listeners' approval; on a boat ride nearMyrtle Beachin the Carolina coast,[5]convincing passengers not to pick up someone in distress; gettingroadside assistancefrom strangers; and interviewing for a staff job with theAtlanta Hawkswhile being fed silly actions and lines by the others. Individual challenges and pranks also arise. Sal gets locked in a motel room with a chainedwhite tiger. Q has to ride a horse while wearing agladiatoruniform to meet with the others. Murr visits a club with scantily-clad women only to be surprised with his family wishing him happy birthday behind a two way mirror. Joe dresses like acave trollto surprise a tour group. Q gives a presentation at a social media conference but the videotape footage includes a bit of his real parents acting out lead-in scenes of softcore porn. Sal attends a fan party featuringJaden Smith, dressed as Jaden's number-one fan. He shows off his tattoo of Smith from a previous season to him, but Smith has Sal get an updated one on his other thigh.
When they arrive in Miami, Murr ends up being the loser, so he has to stay behind while the others go to the party, until Murr decides to sneak into the show using the same security disguise from 1994. This results in Abdul recognizing them from when they crashed her concert 25 years ago. Sal gets tasered but Joe acts as a hype man and sways the crowd to cheer for them. The next day, withJoey Fatonein the background atMiami Beach, Joe tells the Jokers that he received an offer to go on tour with Abdul as a hype man, but turned it down. Since Murr snuck into the party, the others decide to subject him to one last punishment. Joe, Q, and Sal fly back to Staten Island on a private jet, while Murr rides harnessed to the top wing of a stunt plane.
The film was produced by The Tenderloins,Chris Henchy(who also served as the director), Buddy Enright andFunny or Die's Jim Ziegler. The film was executively produced by Mike Farah and Joe Farrell of Funny or Die, Marissa Ronca, Chris Linn & Jack Rovner.[6]Henchy said that he had first heard of the Tenderloins group as his daughters were watching theImpractical JokersTV show, and was contacted by his agent about two weeks later with an offer to direct the film.[7]
Principal photographyfor the film began in May 2018, inNew York.[8][9]The cinematographers used professional sound and video quality unlike the TV show to make the movie have a better aesthetic. Filming concluded on June 5, 2018.[10]
On September 20, 2019, it was announced that the film would be released in 2020 throughWarnerMedia.[11]In December, TruTV released a trailer and announced a February 21, 2020 release in select theaters.[12]

TruTV(stylized astruTV) is an Americanbasic cablechannelowned byWarner Bros. Discovery. The channel primarily broadcasts reruns ofcomedy,docusoapsandreality shows, with a recent strong primetime focus on live sports. The channel was originally launched on December 14, 1990 asCourt TV,a network that focused oncrime-themed programs such astrue crimedocumentary series,legal dramas, and coverage of prominent criminal cases. The channel was initially a joint venture betweenTime Warner,Cablevision,American Lawyer Media,Liberty Media, andGE, with Liberty joining the venture a year after its launch in 1991.
By 2005, Liberty Media and Time Warner had purchased ALM, Cablevision and GE's stakes in Court TV. Time Warner subsequently bought out Liberty's share in 2006 for $735 million, and brought the channel under theTurner Broadcasting System. In 2008, the channel relaunched as TruTV, changing its focus to action-orienteddocusoapsand "caught on camera" programs, which it marketed as "actuality" television. The channel continued to carry legal coverage during the daytime hours under the titleIn Session, but this was phased out by September 2013. The Court TV name was later bought by Katz Broadcasting (nowScripps Networks), which since 2017 has been part of theE. W. Scripps Company.
In 2011, the channel began to add occasional sports broadcasts from Turner Sports (renamedTNT Sportsin 2023), primarily theNCAA men's basketball tournament. In October 2014, TruTV pivoted its format to focus more oncomedy-based reality series, such asImpractical Jokers. In March 2024, TruTV began to increase its focus on sports programming, introducing a weeknight block that will feature sports-related programming, as well as being incorporated into new and upcoming TNT Sports rights such asMotoGPandNASCAR. As of January 2016,[update]TruTV was available to approximately 91 million households (78.1%) in the United States.[1]By June 2023, this number has dropped to 68.3 million households.[2]
TheCourtroom Television Network, orCourt TVfor short, was launched on July 1, 1991, at 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and was available to three million subscribers.[3]Its original anchors wereJack Ford,Fred Graham,Cynthia McFadden, andGregg Jarrett. The network was born out of two competing projects to launch cable channels with live courtroom proceedings, the American Trial Network fromTime WarnerandAmerican Lawyer Media(ALM), and In Court fromCablevisionandNBC. Both projects were present at theNational Cable Television Associationin June 1990.[4]Rather than trying to establish two competing networks, the projects were combined on December 14, 1990.Liberty Mediawould join the venture in 1991.
The channel originally consisted of live courtroom trials that are interspersed with anchors and reporters. It was led by law writerSteven Brill, who later left the network in 1997. The network came into its own during theMenéndez brothers' first trial in 1994, and theO.J. Simpson murder trialin 1995.
In 1997, Time Warner acquired ALM to gain ownership of its stake in Court TV;[5]it subsequently sold its publications to a private equity fund in 1998.[6]In 1998, NBC sold its share of the network to Time Warner. That same year, Court TV began running several original and acquired programs in prime time, such asHomicide: Life on the Street,Cops, andForensic Files.
In 2001, Court TV purchasedThe Smoking Gun, a website that focuses on legal items such asmug shotsand other public documents pertaining to famous individuals and cases. The site remained a property of the company through the rebranding to TruTV, but was sold back to its founder in 2014.[7]In the same year, Court TV also purchased the websiteCrime Library, which provided detailed information about infamous crimes and how they were solved. The website remained an actively updated TruTV property until 2014 and was taken offline in 2015.
On February 3, 2003, "Court TV Plus" debuted onSirius Satellite Radio, featuring audio from Court TV programs. Launched on Channel 134, it was moved in September 2005 and aired on Channel 110 until the channel ceased operations on January 1, 2008.
Recognizing the growth of its primetime programming, Court TV announced in 2005 that it would split its programming into two brands. Daytime trial coverage was branded asCourt TV News, while other dayparts—promoted under the tagline "Seriously Entertaining"—focused onreality showsdealing with crime-related topics. In January 2006, the network launched a male-targeted programming block known as "RED" ("Real. Exciting. Dramatic.").[8][9]
In May 2006, Time Warner acquired Liberty Media's stake in Court TV for $735 million, valuing the channel at $1.5 billion. The channel was integrated into Time Warner'sTurner Broadcastingunit; executives indicated that Court TV planned to maintain its existing format, and did not rule out creating synergies withCNNfor their legal coverage.[10][11]In 2007, the channel premiered its first original scripted series,'Til Death Do Us Part—ananthologyof crime re-enactments hosted by filmmakerJohn Waters.[12]
On July 11, 2007, Time Warner announced that Court TV would be relaunched as TruTV on January 1, 2008. The new brand was intended to accompany a larger shift towards action-oriented reality series which did not necessarily involve crime or law enforcement, such asBlack Gold,Hardcore Pawn,Lizard Lick Towing,Ocean Force, and the caught-on-camera seriesWorld's Dumbest. TruTV promoted its new positioning under the slogan "Not Reality. Actuality."; network staff argued that the term "reality" had become associated with "unrealistic" programming, and that it wanted to emphasize that its new programs would feature "real" people.[13][14][15]
As part of the re-branding as TruTV, daytime trial coverage was cut back to 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. ET and branded asIn Session.In 2009, production of the program was shifted to the facilities ofHLNin Atlanta. On March 4, 2013,In Sessionwas cut to a two-hour, taped format. On September 30, 2013,In Sessionwas cancelled, and replaced by a block of library programming under the titleIn Session Presents.[16][17]
In 2011, as part of a new partnership betweenCBS SportsandTurner Sports, TruTV began to broadcastcoverageof theNCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.[18]
Reruns of Court TV series have since aired on HLN (primarilyForensic Files), and have also been syndicated to the over-the-air digital network Justice Network (nowTrue Crime Network). With changes to HLN's programming strategy and the growing popularity of the genre, the network began to produce and premiere more original true crime programs in 2017.[19][20][21][22]In December 2018, Turner sold the rights to theCourt TVbrand and programming library toScripps MediasubsidiaryKatz Broadcasting, which relaunched it as an over-the-air digital network in May 2019, reviving the dormant brand after 11 years.[23][24]
Although noting that it had experienced "tremendous success" with individual programs, TruTV's new president and head of programming Chris Linn explained that the network's overall growth as a brand had been hindered due to its lingering association with Court TV and its tone of programming, and its reliance on "conflict-reliant, heavy, dramatic and maybe overly produced"docuserieswith derivative premises. In April 2014, the network announced that it would undergo abrand repositioningfor the 2014–15 television season aimed towards "funseekers", with a focus on comedy-orienteddocusoaps, semi-scriptedseries, sketch comedies and reality competitions.[25][26][27]
Building upon the success ofImpractical Jokers(which Linn compared to a "canary in the coal mine" due to its contrasting premise to other truTV programs at the time) andThe Carbonaro Effect, the network greenlit a number of new series as part of the re-launch, includingBarmageddon, the "reality musical"Branson Famous,Fake Off,Hack My Life, andKart Life. As part of the relaunch, a new marketing campaign ("Way More Fun") and updated logo were introduced on October 27, 2014, with the channel being temporarily marketed as "The New truTV" to emphasize the change in format.[25][26][27]
Since the repositioning, TruTV has also parodied its temporary prominence during the NCAA tournament with various advertising campaigns, seeking to promote the channel and its programming to the expanded audience. A common theme of these campaigns, which have included the 2015social mediacampaign "#HaveUFoundtrutv", and a "truTV Awareness Month" campaign in 2018, involved commenting upon viewers who were having trouble finding TruTV on their television provider's lineup, or were unaware of the channel entirely. Of the former, Puja Vohra, Senior vice president of marketing and digital, explained that the campaign was intended to portray the network's brand as being "fun" and "self-aware".[28][29]
In December 2016, truTV unveiled a new marketing campaign and slogan, "Funny Because It's tru". The campaign reinforced the network's focus on comedy by satirizing the "cliches" oftelevision promos.[30]

As part of these changes, the channel's last original non-sports series,Impractical Jokers, would also move permanently to TBS beginning that summer (after having recently simulcast new episodes with TruTV).[32]After its soft launch, it was announced in July 2024 that the block would be given a more "pronounced" presence and branding beginning in October.[33]

The U.S. version of Court TV had earlier been approved by theCanadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commissionas an eligible foreign channel in 1997, and indeed, had been carried by several Canadian service providers prior to the launch of the domestic service.[52]Even after its rebrand, TruTV was never withdrawn as an eligible foreign service for carriage on cable and satellite, meaning that, particularly with the end of the licensing agreement with CHUM, there were few theoretical hurdles that prevented TruTV from re-emerging on Canadian service providers.[53]
Ultimately, the rights to TruTV's original programs have been dispersed across other Canadian cable channels, particularlyCMTandAction, both owned byCorus Entertainment, andOLN, owned byRogers Media.

What Say You?, an occasional podcast hosted by Sal and Q, was named Best New Show at the 2013 Stitcher Awards.[11]The increased popularity ofWhat Say Yousparked a friendly competition among the friends, spurring Joe and Murr to release their own Tenderloins podcast without the other two members. In 2015,What Say You?was nominated for the Comedy, Entertainment, and Best Produced Podcast Awards at the 10th AnnualPodcast Awards.[12]Sal and Q have stated that the podcast is their own side project, not a replacement ofThe Tenderloins Podcast. The group explained that it was difficult to coordinate the schedules of all four members outside of work, making it challenging to produce their troupe's official podcast with any regularity.[citation needed]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
