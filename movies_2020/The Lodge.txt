The Lodgeis a 2019psychological horrorfilm directed byVeronika Franz and Severin Fiala, written by Franz, Fiala, and Sergio Casci, and starringRiley Keough,Jaeden Martell,Lia McHugh,Alicia Silverstone, andRichard Armitage. Its plot follows a soon-to-be stepmother who, alone with her fiancé's two children, becomes stranded at their rural lodge duringChristmas. There, she and the children experience a number of unexplained events that seem to be connected to her past.
The project was announced in October 2017, with Riley Keough joining the cast of the film and Franz and Fiala directing from a screenplay they wrote alongside Sergio Casci. Much of the cast joined that February 2018 andprincipal photographybegan in March 2018 and wrapped that same month.
It had its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 25, 2019, and was initially scheduled to be released in the United States in November 2019 byNeon. However, Neon pushed its released back to the following year. The film was given alimited releasein the U.S. on February 7, 2020, which expanded on February 21. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances, direction, and screenplay, as well as the horror elements.
Laura Hall takes her own life after her estranged husband Richard informs her he plans to marry Grace Marshall, a woman he met while researching a book about anextremistcult. Raised in the cult, Grace was the sole survivor of theirmass suicide, led by her father. Laura's death devastates her and Richard's children, teenage Aiden and young Mia.
Six months later, Richard announces that they will spendChristmaswith Grace at the family's remoteMassachusettslodge to get to know each other. Aiden and Mia uncover Grace's past, including video footage of the cult, showing the deceased followers draped in purple silk with duct tape across their mouths reading "sin." At the lodge, the children act hostile toward Grace and refuse efforts to bond with her, even after Richard departs back to the city for a work obligation. Grace's unease is compounded by the abundance ofCatholic iconography(including a reproduction of theVirgin AnnunciatebyAntonello da Messina) in the cabin, which causes her to have nightmares about her father. After being rebuked for watching her shower, Aiden prepares Grace a cup of cocoa and the group watches a movie; during which the siblings decide to use a gas heater indoors and Grace wonders whether it is safe.
In the morning, Grace awakens to discover that her belongings – including her clothing, psychiatric medication, and pet dog – are missing, as well as all the food and Christmas decorations. The generator has gone out, leaving all of their cell phones dead. Grace suspects the children have pranked her but finds their belongings missing as well. She notices the clocks have advanced to January 9. Aiden tells Grace he dreamed the gas heater malfunctioned and they all suffocated and expresses fear that they may be in theafterlife.
Over the next several days, Grace succumbs to anxiety,medication withdrawal, hunger, and cold. She begins sleepwalking and is tormented by disturbing visions and dreams, including the recurrent voice of her father sermonizing. She attempts to walk to the nearest town, discovering a cross-shaped cabin where she sees her father beckoning to her. She eventually travels in a circle, taking her back to the lodge. Buried in the snow, she discovers a photo of Aiden and Mia in a memorial frame, and inside, finds the children praying over a newspaper article detailing the deaths of all three fromcarbon monoxide poisoningon December 22, 2019. Aiden insists they are inpurgatory, and hangs himself in the attic as proof that they are dead, only to inexplicably survive.
Grace suffers anervous breakdown, which intensifies when she finds her dog frozen to death outside. She enters acatatonicstate on the porch. Worried she might die of exposure, the children finally admit that they have beengaslightingher the entire time, having drugged her, hidden their possessions in a crawlspace, faked the hanging, and played recordings of her father's sermons via a wireless speaker. With their own phones dead at last, the children unsuccessfully attempt to start the generator and bring Grace her medication, but find her convinced that they are in purgatory and must dopenanceto be accepted by God and ascend toheaven.
That night, the children witness Graceself-flagellatingby burning herself on the hearth. They hide in the attic but Grace confronts them in the morning, insisting they must "sacrifice something for the Lord" and "free themselves from idols" before setting Mia's doll on fire. Richard returns to discover an inconsolable Grace holding hisrevolver. In an attempt to prove her belief that they are in purgatory, she first fires the gun at herself, however no bullet is fired. Convinced it is a sign of her incapacity of dying for being in the afterlife, she turns the gun and opens fire at Richard, shooting him in the head and killing him. Aiden and Mia attempt to flee in the car, but get stuck in the snow. Grace forces the children back into the lodge, where she seats them at the dinner table with their father's corpse and singsNearer, My God, to Thee.She affixes duct tape reading "sin" over each of their mouths while a loaded gun rests on the table.
The original screenplay forThe Lodgewas written by Scottish screenwriter Sergio Casci, which had been sold toHammer Films.[6]Hammer offered the screenplay to be directed by filmmaking duoVeronika Franz and Severin Fiala.[6]The two agreed, though they rewrote a significant portion of the script, including the ending, which Franz felt "didn't work."[6]
In October 2017,Riley Keoughjoined the cast of the film in the lead role of Grace.[7][8]Prior to her being cast, Franz and Fiala were considering another unnamed actress for the part, but ultimately chose Keough.[9]Franz stated: "The other actress had already started a journal about the character’s trauma. Then we met Riley, first on Skype and later personally. You know—it’s about meeting someone and connecting. That’s the first step: can you trust this person?"[9]
In February 2018,Jaeden Martell,Richard ArmitageandLia McHughjoined the cast of the film, with production beginning that same day. To establish chemistry between Martell and McHugh, portraying siblings, directors Franz and Fiala took them on several excursions, including rock climbing and ice skating, to help establish a bond between the two before filming began.[10]Keough was kept separated from the children pre-filming meetings to maintain a distance from them for their onscreen dynamic.[10]Keough's father Danny plays Aaron Marshall, the cult leader and father of Keough's character, Grace.[5]
Filming ofThe Lodgetook place outside ofMontrealin the winter of 2018.[11]The lodge featured in the film was located on agolfresort which was closed for the winter season.[12]The film was shot in chronological order.[13]Fiala elaborated on the decision to shoot chronologically: "[Riley] was worried that the journey her character takes was a very difficult one, because she has to hit every mark in a way that it still is plausible. And in order to help her walking down the path, we shot the whole film in sequence, not only to help her, but to help us, in order to really make this journey and watch every step we take. We felt it would help all the actors, actually, and could benefit their performances so much that we fought for that a lot."[13]
The film was shot by cinematographerThimios Bakatakis, a frequent collaborator ofYorgos Lanthimos.[13]While shooting the interiors, Bakatakis, Franz, and Fiala deliberately chose to not frame shots at eye-level, instead opting for angles positioned from above or below the actors.[13]Fiala commented that they intended to model the film after a haunted house movie, allowing the audience to initially suspect that the children's deceased mother, Laura, may be in fact haunting the home; in this regard, they were inspired specifically byAlfred Hitchcock'sRebecca(1940), in which a woman comes to believe her home is haunted by her husband's deceased first wife.[13]
The film had its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 25, 2019.[14]Shortly after,Neonacquired distribution rights to the film, and it made its east coast premiere in the After Hours section of the 28thPhiladelphia Film Festival.[15][16]The film was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on November 15, 2019,[17]but it was delayed until February 7, 2020, when it was given alimited releaseinLos AngelesandNew York City.[18][19]The theatrical release expanded to 320 theaters in the United States on February 21, 2020.[3]
During its opening week,The Lodgegrossed $76,251 in six theaters in the United States.[3]On February 14, the week following its initial release, the film expanded to 21 theaters, and had a weekend gross of $158,047.[3]The film expanded to 322 theaters the following weekend.[3]It concluded its U.S. theatrical run with a total gross of $1,666,564, and an international gross of $1,015,220, making for a worldwide gross of $2,681,784.[3]
On review aggregator websiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 182 reviews, with an average of 7/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "Led by an impressive Riley Keough performance,The Lodgeshould prove a suitably unsettling destination for fans of darkly atmospheric horror."[20]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[21]
Dennis Harvey ofVarietywrote that "The Lodgemay be best taken on the same terms as '60s/early '70s Italiangiallos, with their somewhat random manipulations of plot and character logic in service of atmospheric shocks. Genre homage does not appear to be an intention here, but the film is certainly at its best in fostering a sense of stylish dread and orchestrating some harrowing individual sequences."[22]Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comechoed a similar sentiment, deeming the film "a truly unsettling movie, the kind of horror film that rattles you on an almost subconscious level, making you more uncomfortable than going for cheap scares. Don't ask questions or dissect the believability of the plot. Just check in."[23]
Jeannette Catsoulis ofThe New York Timesnoted the film's atmosphere as "so wintry in tone and setting that no movie-theater thermostat will banish its chill," but ultimately felt that "despite its visual flair and unrelentingly taut atmosphere,The Lodgeis more successful in sustaining unease... than in building a convincing narrative."[24]Benjamin Lee, writing forThe Guardian, awarded the film four out of five stars, alternately praising it as "an accomplished beast: poking, prodding and teasing as it throws out potential twists before settling on the most devastating one of all. It's not an entirely unpredictable revelation but it's a smart, knowing and nasty way to go, taking the film to a place that's both staggeringly grim and hopelessly sad."[25]
Several critics singled out Keough's lead performance with praise, including Michael Roffman ofConsequence of Sound, who deemed it a "career-best... so much of Keough's performance contends with the bitter silence of reproach, isolation, and abandonment. Keough thrives in these moments, oozing with all kinds of anxious body language. It's in her glances. Those stares. The way she timidly saunters from room to room. She's a vessel of tragedy that's all the more tragic in her vicious attempts to keep on trying."[26]TheLos Angeles Times's Justin Chang felt the film paled in comparison to Franz and Fiala's previous film,Goodnight Mommy, but similarly praised Keough's performance as "the movie's strongest asset... [Keough] can seize and hold the screen with electrifying force... [and] is no less powerful in her quieter, more recessive moments."[27]

NEON Rated, LLC,doing business asNeon(stylized inall caps), is an Americanindependent filmproductionanddistributioncompany founded in 2017 by CEO Tom Quinn andTim League, who also was the co-founder of theAlamo Drafthouse Cinemachain.[1]As of 2019, League is no longer involved with daily operations for the company.[6]
Its first film,Colossal, was released in 2017.[7]The company became known for distributing such notable films asI, Tonya(2017),Parasite(2019),Portrait of a Lady on Fire(2019),Palm Springs(2020),Flee(2021),Spencer(2021),The Worst Person in the World(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023),Anora(2024),Longlegs(2024),The Seed of the Sacred Fig(2024), andThe Monkey(2025).[8][9]
Parasitewent on to become Neon's highest-grossing film at the worldwidebox officewith $262 million and the first non-English-language film to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture.[10]In 2024,Longlegshad a domestic box office gross of $58.6 million, becoming the distributor's highest-grossing film ever in North America.[11]Anorabecame the company's second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[12]Neon has also worked with several high-profile filmmakers, which includesSean Baker,[13]Bong Joon Ho,Julia Ducournau,Craig Gillespie,Pablo Larraín, andCéline Sciamma.[14]
During the 4th Annual Zurich Summit, Tom Quinn commented on Neon's intent to release titles that appeal to audiences who "skew under 45, that have no aversion to violence, no aversion to foreign language and to non-fiction".[15]Explaining the success of the company in 2024, Quinn stated: "We were very much a startup, with everyone functioning as this sophisticated amoeba. We very quickly found ourselves that year inTorontowith a great slate [...] That work enabled us to sit at the table in Toronto that year and buyI, Tonya. Before the ink was even dry on the deal, we were planning itsOscar campaign. It's a testament to how quickly we can make decisions because we're not this big studio. We've always used that to our advantage."[16]
In September 2017, the company partnered withBlumhouse Productionsto manage BH Tilt.[17]In 2018, a majority stake of Neon was sold to30West, the media venture arm of "The Friedkin Group".[4][18]In February 2021,Bleecker Streetpartnered with Neon to launch the joint home entertainment distribution companyDecal, which is a standalone full-service operation that handlesdistribution dealson the home entertainment rights to both Neon and Bleecker Street's features. The first film to be distributed through Decal was the Bleecker Street releaseSupernovain winter 2021.[5]Additionally, Decal acquired North American distribution rights to the South Africanhorror filmGaiafor a summertheatrical release, marking their first ever acquisition.[19]
Andrew Brown (Co-President of Decal) oversaw the launch of Neon's home entertainment division. In 2022, Brown was promoted to "President of Digital Distribution". The exec, who has served as "SVP of Digital Strategy, Marketing, and Distribution" for Neon since 2017, also manages Neon's library, and oversees the annualFYC DVD Box Setanddirect-to-consumerdigital portal "Neon Cinema".[20]Prior to the joint-venture,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, as well asThe Criterion CollectionandWell Go USA Entertainment(for the filmPossessorwhich Neon and Well Go co-distributed), distributed several Neon films onhome video.[21][22][23]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, Neon was approved to continue promotional activities for its films since the company does not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP) nor had encountered any issue in receivingSAG-AFTRAinterim agreements.[24][25][26]
In August 2023, Neon hired formerA24employees Alexandra Altschuler as "VP Media" and Don Wilcox as "VP Marketing".[27]That same month, Neon hired former Sierra/Affinity employee Kristen Figeroid as "President of International Sales and Distribution", Laurel Charnetsky as "VP International Acquisitions & Operations", and Dan Stadnicki as "Manager, International Sales & Distribution".[28]In May 2024, Neon hired Joey Monteiro as "EVP, International Marketing" and Ashley Hirsch as "Manager of International Sales and Marketing".[29]That same month, Neon promoted Elissa Federoff from "President of Distribution" to "Chief Distribution Officer" and Ryan Friscia from "EVP, Finance and Business Development" to "Chief Financial Officer".[30]Furthermore, Jeff Deutchman, who joined Neon when it was launched, serves as "President of Acquisitions and Production".[31]
Additionally, Neon has acquired the distribution rights to fivePalme d'Orwinners at theCannes Film Festival:Parasite(2019),Titane(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023), andAnora(2024); all five won consecutively.[31][32][33]The company's strategy to acquire such titles at Cannes is to eschew "the lazy approach", said Deutchman. "The only real way to do Cannes is to go see as many movies as you can, because you never know where the nextDogtoothorBorderorHungerorForce Majeureis going to come from", he added, citing several modern Cannes standouts championed by arthouse buyers.[31]After acquiringParasitein 2018, Neon financed and distributed the film the following year in U.S. territories.[34]"From the very beginning, Tom Quinn sawParasiteas a universal film and refused to put it in a box as a foreign-language or international film", saidParasitedirectorBong Joon Ho. "He saw the heart of the film and understood that it was about all of us living in our modern class-based society. I was always grateful for that."[16]Neon spent $20 million promoting, distributing, and campaigning for the film's awards.[3]The film subsequently became Neon's highest-grossing film with more than $200 million at the worldwidebox officeand won fourAcademy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Director. Similarly, Neon spent $18 million promotingAnora, three times the film's original budget.[3]Anoraultimately won the two aforementioned Academy Awards whileAnatomy of a FallandTriangle of Sadnesswere nominated for the same two categories, among others. As of March 2025, Neon has garnered 39 Academy Award nominations, winning 11 overall.[10][12][35]
In 2023, Quinn commented on the company's success at Cannes, saying: "We've seen over the years that each of these films, because of their credibility and success, the Palme d'Or has come to mean something quite impactful for a very young group ofcinephiles. And the reason why we know this is we've tested all these movies and dating back toParasite, probably I think, the fifth reason why people came to see the film, in itstest screeninginSherman Oaks, was the fact that it won the Palme d'Or, and each subsequent year that went up. And this year, the number one reason why people came to see the film [Anatomy of a Fall], at a test screening inBurbank, was the fact that it had won the Palme d'Or."[36]In 2024, Quinn stated: "The award means a lot. To audiences here who are looking for the absolute most adventurous, forward-looking cinema available, that award represents it because these films have delivered, and they've been major Oscar contenders."[16]
In July 2024, Neon received its biggest opening weekend at the box office with the horror thriller filmLonglegs, after scoring $22.6 million from 2,510 theaters (a figure that includes $2.5–3 million in Thursday previews) and only behindUniversal/Illumination's second weekend ofDespicable Me 4. Initially projected to gross $7–9 million, the opening marked the biggest total for an original horror film of 2024, one of the top 20 weekends for an independent film and the best opening ever for an independent horror film.[37][38][39]To promote the film, Neon utilizedguerrilla marketingtactics similar to those that led to the box office success ofThe Blair Witch Project(1999).[40]DirectorOz Perkinscredited Neon for the film's marketing, stating the studio "really responded strongly to the movie, the raw materials of the movie really excited them, the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it sounds. They asked me early on, 'Do we have your permission to kind of go nuts?' And I said, 'What else are we doing here? Go for it. Do your thing.'"[41]The film's total marketing budget was under $10 million, focusing ondigital contentand not havingtelevision ads.[37]During its third weekend,Longlegsbecame the company's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office, earning $58.6 million, surpassing whatParasiteearned with $53.3 million in 2020.[11]Furthermore, it became the top grossing R-rated horror film of 2024 and the highest-grossing indie horror film of the last decade, topping A24'sTalk to Me(2022),Insidious: Chapter 3(2015) fromFocus Features, and A24'sHereditary(2018).[11]Afterward, furthering their marketing campaign, from August 1 to 4, Neon (partnering withAtom Tickets) offered free tickets to anyone who has a birthday that falls on the 14th of any given month. To get the tickets, those who registered and purchased tickets through Atom Tickets received a special promo code after verifying their date of birth and were able to get one free ticket per customer, while supplies lasted.[42]

Hammer Film Productions Ltd.is a Britishfilm productioncompany based in London. Founded in 1934, the company is best known for a series ofGothichorror and fantasy films made from the mid-1950s until the 1970s. Many of these involve classic horror characters such asBaron Victor Frankenstein,Count Dracula, and theMummy, which Hammer reintroduced to audiences by filming them in vivid colour for the first time.[1]Hammer also producedscience fiction,thrillers,film noirandcomedies, as well as, in later years,television series.
During its most successful years, Hammer dominated thehorror filmmarket, enjoying worldwide distribution and considerable financial success. This success was, in part, due to its distribution partnerships with American companiesUnited Artists,Warner Bros.,Universal Pictures,Columbia Pictures,Paramount Pictures,20th Century Studios,Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer,American International PicturesandSeven Arts Productions.
During the late 1960s and 1970s, the saturation of the horror film market by competitors and the loss of American funding forced changes to the previously lucrative Hammer formula with varying degrees of success. The company eventually ceased production in the mid-1980s. In 2000, the studio was bought by a consortium including advertising executive and art collectorCharles Saatchiand publishing millionairesNeil MendozaandWilliam Sieghart.[2]The company announced plans to begin making films again, but none was produced.
In May 2007, the company name was sold to a consortium headed by Dutch media tycoonJohn de Mol, who announced plans to spend some $50 million (£25m) on new horror films. The new organization acquired the Hammer group's film library of 295 pictures.Simon Oakes, who took over as CEO of the new Hammer, said, "Hammer is a great British brand—we intend to take it back into production and develop its global potential. The brand is still alive but no one has invested in it for a long time."[3]
Since then, Hammer has produced several films, includingBeyond the Rave(2008),Let Me In(2010),The Resident(2011),The Woman in Black(2012),The Quiet Ones(2014), andThe Lodge(2019).
In November 1934,William Hinds, a comedian and businessman, registered his film company, Hammer Productions Ltd.[4][5]It was housed in a three-room office suite at Imperial House,Regent Street, London. The company name came from Hinds' stage name, Will Hammer, which he had taken from the area of London in which he lived,Hammersmith.[6]
Work began almost immediately on the first film, a nowlostcomedy,The Public Life of Henry the Ninthat the MGM/ATP studios. Filming concluded on 2 January 1935. The film tells the story of Henry Henry, an unemployed London street musician, and the title was a "playful tribute" toAlexander Korda'sThe Private Life of Henry VIIIwhich was Britain's firstAcademy Award for Best Picturenominee in 1934.[7]During this time Hinds met Spanish émigré Enrique Carreras, a former cinema owner, and on 10 May 1935 they formed thefilm distributioncompany Exclusive Films, operating from an office at 60-66 National House,Wardour Street.[8]Hammer produced four films distributed by Exclusive:
A slump in the British film industry forced Hammer intobankruptcy, and the company went into liquidation in 1937. Exclusive survived and on 20 July 1937 purchased the leasehold on 113-117 Wardour Street and continued to distribute films made by other companies.[9]
James Carreras, Enrique's son, joined Exclusive in 1938, closely followed by William Hinds' son, Anthony. At the outbreak of World War II, James Carreras andAnthony Hindsleft to join the armed forces and Exclusive continued to operate in a limited capacity. In 1946, James Carreras rejoined the company afterdemobilisation. He resurrected Hammer as the film production arm of Exclusive with a view to supplying 'quota-quickies', cheaply made domestic films designed to fill gaps in cinema schedules and support more expensive features.[10]He convinced Anthony Hinds to rejoin the company, and a revived Hammer Film Productions set to work onDeath in High Heels,The Dark Road, andCrime Reporter. Not able to afford top stars, Hammer acquired the film rights to BBC radio series such asThe Adventures of PC 49andDick Barton: Special Agent(an adaptation of the successfulDick Bartonradio show).[11]All were filmed at Marylebone Studios during 1947. During the production ofDick Barton Strikes Back(1948), it became apparent that the company could save money by shooting incountry housesinstead of studios. For the next production,Dr Morelle – The Case of the Missing Heiress(another radio adaptation), Hammer rented Dial Close,[12][13]a 23 bedroom mansion on Winter Hill,[14]beside theRiver Thames, atCookham Dean,Maidenhead.[15]
On 12 February 1949, Exclusive registered "Hammer Film Productions" as a company with Enrique and James Carreras, and William and Tony Hinds as directors. Hammer moved into the Exclusive offices in 113-117 Wardour Street, and the building was rechristened "Hammer House".[16]
In August 1949, complaints from locals about noise during night filming forced Hammer to leave Dial Close and move into another mansion,Oakley Court, also on the banks of the Thames betweenWindsorand Maidenhead.[17]Five films were produced there:Man in Black(1949),Room to Let(1949),Someone at the Door(1949),What the Butler Saw(1950),The Lady Craved Excitement(1950).
In 1950, Hammer moved again to Gilston Park, a country club in Harlow, Essex, which hostedThe Black Widow,The Rossiter Case,To Have and to HoldandThe Dark Light(all 1950).
In 1951, Hammer began shooting at their most fondly-remembered base, Down Place, on the banks of the Thames. The company signed a one-year lease and began its 1951 production schedule withCloudburst. The house, virtually derelict, required substantial work, but it did not have the construction restrictions that had prevented Hammer from customising previous homes. A decision was made to remodel Down Place into a substantial, custom-fitted studio complex[18]that became known asBray Studios. The expansive grounds were used for much of the later location shooting in Hammer's films and are a key to the 'Hammer look'.
Also in 1951, Hammer and Exclusive signed a four-year production and distribution contract withRobert Lippert, an American film producer. The contract meant thatLippert Picturesand Exclusive effectively exchanged products for distribution on their respective sides of theAtlantic– beginning in 1951 withThe Last Pageand ending with 1955'sWomen Without Men(a.k.a.Prison Story).[19]It was Lippert's insistence on an American star in the Hammer films he was to distribute that led to the prevalence of American leads in many of the company's productions during the 1950s. It was forThe Last Pagethat Hammer made a significant appointment when they hired film directorTerence Fisher, who played a critical role in the forthcoming horror cycle.
Towards the end of 1951, the one-year lease on Down Place expired, and with its growing success Hammer looked towards more conventional studio-based productions. A dispute with the Association of Cinematograph Technicians blocked this proposal, and the company purchased the freehold of Down Place instead. The house was renamedBray Studiosafter the nearby village ofBray, and it remained Hammer's principal base until 1966.[19]In 1953, the first of Hammer's science fiction films,Four Sided TriangleandSpaceways, were released.
Hammer's first significant experiment with horror came in a 1955 adaptation ofNigel Kneale'sBBC Televisionscience fiction serialThe Quatermass Experiment, directed byVal Guest. As a consequence of the contract with Robert Lippert, American actorBrian Donlevywas imported for the lead role and the title was changed toThe Quatermass Xperimentto cash in on the newX certificatefor horror films. The film was unexpectedly popular, and led to the popular 1957 sequelQuatermass 2– again adapted from one of Kneale's television scripts, this time by Kneale and with a budget double that of the original: £92,000.[20]In the meantime, Hammer produced anotherQuatermass-style horror film,X the Unknown, originally intended as part of the series until Kneale denied them permission to use his characters (the writer is known to have disliked Donlevy's performance as Quatermass).[21]At the time, Hammer voluntarily submitted scripts to theBritish Board of Film Censors(BBFC) for comment before production. Regarding the script ofX the Unknown, one reader/examiner (Audrey Field) commented on 24 November:
Well, no one can say the customers won't have had their money's worth by now. In fact, someone will almost certainly have been sick. We must have a great deal more restraint, and much more done by onlookers' reactions instead of by shots of 'pulsating obscenity', hideous scars, hideous sightless faces, etc, etc. It is keeping on and on in the same vein that makes this script so outrageous. They must take it away and prune. Before they take it away, however, I think the President [of the BBFC] should read it. I have a stronger stomach than the average (for viewing purposes) and perhaps I ought to be reacting more strongly.[22]
The scores for many Hammer horror films, includingThe Curse of FrankensteinandDracula, were composed byJames Bernard. Other Hammer musical personnel includedMalcolm Williamson,John Hollingsworth, andHarry Robertson.
Production designerBernard RobinsonandcinematographerJack Asherwere instrumental in creating the lavish look of the early Hammer films, usually on a very restricted budget.
Hammer's horror films featured many actors who appeared repeatedly in a number of movies, forming an informal "Hammer repertory company".
As production began onQuatermass 2, Hammer started to look for another U.S. partner willing to invest in and handle the American promotion of new product. They eventually entered talks withAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.) and head,Eliot Hyman. During this period, two young American filmmakers,Max J. RosenbergandMilton Subotsky, who later established Hammer's rivalAmicus, submitted to a.a.p. a script for an adaptation of the novelFrankenstein. Although interested in the script, a.a.p. were not prepared to back a film made by Rosenberg and Subotsky, who had just one film to their credit. Eliot Hyman however, sent the script to his contact at Hammer. Rosenberg would often claim he 'produced'The Curse of Frankenstein, an exaggeration repeated in his obituary.
Although the novel byMary Shelleywas long since in thepublic domain, Anthony Hinds was unsure about the story, as Subotsky's script adhered closely to the plot of the 1939 Universal filmSon of Frankenstein, featuring a second-generation Baron Frankenstein emulating his father, the original monster-maker. This put the project at risk of acopyrightinfringement lawsuit by Universal. In addition a great deal of polishing and additional material was needed, as the short script had an estimated running time of just 55 minutes, far less than the minimum of 90 minutes needed for distribution in the U.K. Accordingly, comments on the script from Hammer's Michael Carreras (who had joined his father James as producer in the early 1950s) were less than complimentary:
The script is badly presented. The sets are not marked clearly on the shot headings, neither is DAY or NIGHT specified in a number of cases. The number of set-ups scripted is quite out of proportion to the length of the screenplay, and we suggest that your rewrites are done in master scene form.[23]
Further revisions were made to the script, and a working title ofFrankenstein and the Monsterwas chosen. Plans were made to shoot the film in Eastmancolor – a decision which caused worry at the BBFC. Not only did the script contain horror and graphic violence, but it would be portrayed in vivid colour.[24]
The project was handed to Tony Hinds, who was less impressed with the script than Michael Carreras, and whose vision for the film was a simple black-and-white 'quickie' made in three weeks. Concerned that Subotsky and Rosenberg's script had too many similarities to the Universal films, Hinds commissionedJimmy Sangsterto rewrite it asThe Curse of Frankenstein. Sangster's treatment impressed Hammer enough to rescue the film from the 'quickie' treadmill and to produce it as a colour film.
Sangster submitted his script to the BBFC for examination. Audrey Field reported on 10 October 1956:
We are concerned about the flavour of this script, which, in its preoccupation with horror and gruesome detail, goes far beyond what we are accustomed to allow even for the 'X' category. I am afraid we can give no assurance that we should be able to pass a film based on the present script and a revised script should be sent us for our comments, in which the overall unpleasantness should be mitigated.[25]
Regardless of the BBFC's stern warnings, Hinds supervised the shooting of an unchanged script.[26]
The film was directed by Terence Fisher, with a look that belied its modest budget. British TV starPeter CushingportrayedBaron Victor Frankenstein, and supporting actorChristopher Leewas cast as the imposingly tall, brutishCreature. With a budget of £65,000 and a cast and crew that would become the backbone of later films, Hammer's first Gothic horror went into production.[26]The use of colour encouraged a previously unseen level of gore. UntilThe Curse of Frankenstein, horror films had not shown blood in a graphic way, or when they did, it was concealed by monochrome photography. In this film, it was bright red, and the camera lingered on it.
The film was an enormous success, not only in Great Britain, but also in the U.S., where it inspired numerous imitations from, amongst others,Roger CormanandAmerican International Pictures(with their series largely based onEdgar Allan Poe– the so-called "Poe Cycle"). It found success on theEuropean continentalso, where Italian directors and audiences were particularly receptive.
The huge box office success ofThe Curse of Frankensteinled to the inevitable desire for a sequel inThe Revenge of Frankenstein, and an attempt to give the Hammer treatment to another horror icon. Dracula had been a successful film character for Universal in the past, and the copyright situation was more complicated than for Frankenstein. A legal agreement between Hammer and Universal was not completed until 31 March 1958 – after the film had been shot – and was 80 pages long.[27]
Meanwhile, the financial arrangement between a.a.p. and Hammer had broken down when money promised by a.a.p. had not arrived. Hammer began looking for alternatives, and with the success ofThe Curse of Frankensteinsigned withColumbia Picturesto distributeThe Revenge of Frankensteinand two films from the defaulted a.a.p. deal,The Camp on Blood IslandandThe Snorkel. Hammer's financial success also meant the winding-down of the parent film distribution company Exclusive, leaving Hammer to concentrate on filmmaking.[28]
Work continued on the script forDracula, and the second draft was submitted to the BBFC. Audrey Field commented on 8 October 1957:
"The uncouth, uneducated, disgusting and vulgar style of Mr Jimmy Sangster cannot quite obscure the remnants of a good horror story, though they do give one the gravest misgivings about treatment. [...] The curse of this thing is the Technicolor blood: why need vampires be messier eaters than anyone else? Certainly strong cautions will be necessary on shots of blood. And of course, some of the stake-work is prohibitive."[29]
Despite the success ofThe Curse of Frankenstein, the financing ofDraculaproved awkward. Universal was not interested,[30]and the search for money eventually brought Hammer back to a.a.p.'s Eliot Hyman, through another of his companies, Seven Arts (which later merged withWarner Bros., now thesuccessor-in-interest to a.a.p.). Although an agreement was drawn up, it is alleged that the deal was never realised and funding forDraculaeventually came from the National Film Finance Council (£33,000) and the rest from Universal in return for worldwide distribution rights.[31]However, recent research suggests that the issue of who exactly fundedDraculais still not entirely clear (see Barnett, 'Hammering out a Deal: The Contractual and Commercial Contexts ofThe Curse of Frankenstein(1957) andDracula(1958)’,Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, published online 19 November 2013).
With a final budget of £81,412,Draculabegan principal photography on 11 November 1957.[32]Peter Cushing again had top-billing, this time asDoctor Van Helsing, whilst Christopher Lee starred asCount Dracula, with direction by Terence Fisher and a set design byBernard Robinsonthat was radically different from the Universal adaptation; it was so radical, in fact, that Hammer executives considered paying him off and finding another designer.[33]
Draculawas an enormous success, breaking box-office records in the U.K., the U.S. (where it was released asHorror of Dracula), Canada, and across the world. On 20 August 1958, theDaily Cinemareported:
"Because of the fantastic business done world-wide by Hammer's Technicolor version ofDracula, Universal-International, its distributors, have made over to Jimmy Carreras' organisation, the remake rights to their entire library of classic films."
Establishing the fanged vampire inpopular culture, Lee also introduced a dark, brooding sexuality to the character.[34]The academicChristopher Fraylingwrites, “Draculaintroduced fangs, red contact lenses, décolletage, ready-prepared wooden stakes and – in the celebrated credits sequence – blood being spattered from off-screen over the Count's coffin".[35]The film magazineEmpireranked Lee's portrayal as Dracula the 7th Greatest Horror Movie Character of All Time.[36]1960 saw the release of the first in a long line of sequels,The Brides of Dracula, with Cushing returning to the role of Van Helsing, though Lee did not play Dracula again untilDracula: Prince of Darkness, released in 1966.
With the agreement in place, Hammer's executives had their pick of Universal International's horror icons and chose to remakeThe Invisible Man,The Phantom of the Opera, andThe Mummy's Hand. All were to be filmed in colour at Bray Studios, by the same team responsible forThe Curse of FrankensteinandDracula.The Mummy(the title used for the remake ofThe Mummy's Hand, which also incorporated significant story elements from that film's first two sequels,The Mummy's TombandThe Mummy's Ghost) was made in 1959,The Phantom of the Operafollowed in 1962, and Hammer collaborated withWilliam Castleon a remake ofThe Old Dark Housein 1963.The Invisible Manwas never produced.
Principal photography forThe Mummybegan on 23 February 1959 and lasted until 16 April 1959. Once again it starred both Peter Cushing (as John Banning) and Christopher Lee (as Kharis the Mummy), and was directed by Terence Fisher from a screenplay from Jimmy Sangster.The Mummywent into general release on 23 October 1959 and broke the box-office records set byDraculathe previous year, both in Great Britain and the U.S. when it was released there in December.[37]
Hammer consolidated their success by turning their most successful films into series.  This was a practice they had makingDick Bartonmovies which they continued to their horror movies and other genres.
The success ofThe Quatermass Xperiment(1955;The Creeping Unknownin the U.S.) led to two sequels:
There were also twoQuatermass-style films:
Six sequels toThe Curse of Frankensteinwere released between 1958 and 1974:
All starredPeter Cushingas Baron Frankenstein, exceptThe Horror of Frankenstein(which was not a sequel, but a tongue-in-cheek remake ofThe Curse of Frankenstein), in whichRalph Batestook the title role.The Evil of Frankensteinstars Cushing but due to an agreement made with Universal to more closelypastichetheir version of the Frankenstein story, it re-tells the Baron's history in flashbacks that bear no resemblance to the two earlier Hammer Frankenstein films and it portrays the Baron with a very different personality, resulting in a film which permanently breaks the chronological continuity of the series. Each subsequent movie in the series contains elements that do not relate to (or flatly contradict) the events of the movie that went before, whilst the characteristics of Cushing's Baron vary wildly from film to film, resulting in a series that does not progress as a self-contained narrative cycle.[38]
David Prowsewas the only actor to star as the creature twice in the Hammer Frankenstein series; he reprised the role fromThe Horror of FrankensteininFrankenstein and the Monster from Hell.
Hammer also produced a half-hour pilot titledTales of Frankenstein(1958) that was intended to premiere on American television; it was never picked up, but is now available on DVD.Anton Diffringtook over Cushing's role of Baron Frankenstein.[39]
Eight sequels toDraculawere released between 1960 and 1974:
Peter Cushingappeared in the first and final three sequels (with archive footage also used inDracula: Prince of Darkness).Christopher Leeappeared in all the sequels except the first and last.
The first five sequels were direct sequels to the original.The Brides of Draculadid not include Dracula but is still considered part of the series sincePeter Cushingreprises his role as Doctor Van Helsing and battles vampire Baron Meinster (David Peel) and the film makes several direct references to the 1958 original.Christopher Leereturned as Dracula for the following six films, which employed ingenuity in finding new ways to resurrect the Count. Only archive footage of Cushing was used inDracula: Prince of Darknessand he wouldn't return to the Dracula series untilDracula A.D. 1972. Hammer upped the graphic violence and gore withScars of Draculain an attempt to re-imagine the character to appeal to a younger audience, but the movie performed poorly at the box-office which led to a further change of style with the remaining three films.Dracula A.D. 1972andThe Satanic Rites of Draculawere not period pieces like their predecessors, but had a contemporary 1970s London setting. Now set in a new timeline, Peter Cushing appeared in both films, playing Professor Lorrimer Van Helsing, as well as his own grandfather (Lawrence Van Helsing) in the prologue of the first of the two films. Cushing returned for a final time as Professor Van Helsing in the horror / martial arts crossoverThe Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires, a movie this time set primarily in 1904.
Christopher Lee grew increasingly disillusioned with the direction the character was being taken and with the poor quality of later scripts, although he did improve these slightly himself by adding lines of dialogue from the original novel. Lee speaks at least one line taken fromBram Stokerin every Dracula film he appeared in, except forDracula: Prince of Darknessin which the Count does not talk at all (Lee claimed repeatedly he was appalled by his dialogue in that film and refused to speak it, but Jimmy Sangster rebutted that no dialogue was written for the character). He was also concerned about typecasting, and after filmingThe Satanic Rites of Draculahe finally quit the series.John Forbes-Robertsontook over the role for one final outing as the Count.
Three sequels toThe Mummywere released between 1964 and 1971:
Peter CushingandChristopher Leeappeared in none of the Mummy sequels, which had stories and characters unrelated to the 1959 film and all three were relegated to second feature status, as by the mid-1960s, Hammer's films were often intended fordouble features. Often two films would be shot back-to-back with the same sets and costumes to save money, and then each film would be shown on a separate double feature to prevent audiences noticing any recycling, as for example inThe Plague of the ZombiesandThe Reptile(both 1966).The Curse of the Mummy's Tombsupported the slightly more prestigiousThe Gorgon, whilstThe Mummy's Shroudwas a second feature forFrankenstein Created Woman.
Blood from the Mummy's Tombwas a modern-day take onBram Stoker'sThe Jewel of Seven Starsand featuredValerie Leonas a reincarnated Egyptian princess, rather than a mummy. The same novel served as the basis for the 1980Charlton Hestonfilm,The Awakening, and a later direct-to-video feature,Bram Stoker's Legend of the Mummy, starringLou Gossett Jr.
Other horror films produced by Hammer included:
In addition to theirDraculaseries, Hammer produced a number of other horror movies on the vampire theme, including:
Hammer also made a loose trilogy of films, known as ″The Karnstein Trilogy″, based onSheridan Le Fanu's early vampirenovellaCarmilla, written by newcomerTudor Gates. These films include:
Running alongside production of their 1960s gothic horror films, Hammer made a series of what were known as "mini-Hitchcocks" mostly scripted byJimmy Sangster, and directed byFreddie FrancisandSeth Holt. These low-budget suspense thrillers, often in black-and-white, were made in the mould ofLes Diaboliques(1955), although more often compared to the laterPsycho.  This series of mystery thrillers, which all hadtwist endings, comprised:
In addition to these were more traditional thrillers such as:
Hammer had some success with films set in (or with strong connections to) the prehistoric/ancient world, including:
Hammer made several war films over the years:
Hammer were less well known for their comedies, but they made a number in the 1950s and early 1960s, returning to the genre in the 1970s:
Hammer occasionally made science fiction movies. Notable examples were:
Hammer made a number ofswashbucklers, including:
Hammer had some success with films set in the British Empire, such as:
On 29 May 1968, Hammer was awarded theQueen's Award to Industryin recognition of their contribution to the British economy. The presentation ceremony took place on the steps of the Castle Dracula set atPinewood Studios, during the filming ofDracula Has Risen from the Grave.[41]
Hammer films had always sold, in part, on their violent and sexual content. In the late 1960s, with the release of Hollywood films likeBonnie and Clyde,Rosemary's Baby, andThe Wild Bunch, the studio struggled to maintain its place in the market.Roman Polanski'sRosemary's Babywas a successful example ofpsychological horror, whileBonnie and ClydeandThe Wild Bunchexposed mainstream audiences to more explicit gore, and were more expertly staged than Hammer films. Meanwhile,George A. Romero'sNight of the Living Dead(1968) had set a new standard for graphic violence in horror films.
In 1969 Tony Hinds resigned from the Hammer board and retired from the industry.[42]Hammer was not the same without him; it responded to the new reality by bringing in new writers and directors, testing new characters, and attempting to rejuvenate their vampire and Frankenstein films with new approaches to familiar material. (1974'sFrankenstein and the Monster from Hell, for example, features a scene where the Baron treads on a discarded human brain.)
The company soon realised, however, that if they could not be as gory as the new American productions, they could follow a trend in European films of the time and instead play up the sexual content of their films.
While the studio remained true to previous period settings in their 1971 releaseVampire Circus,Dracula AD 1972andThe Satanic Rites of Dracula(1973), for example, abandoned period settings in pursuit of a modern-day setting and a "swinging London" feel.The Satanic Rites of Dracula, then calledDracula is Dead... and Well and Living in London, indulged the turn toward self-parody suggested by the title, with some humour appearing in the script, undercutting any sense of horror. These latter films were not successful and drew fire not only from critics but fromChristopher Leehimself, who refused to appear in any more Dracula films after these. Speaking at a press conference in 1973 to announceDracula is Dead... and Well and Living in London, Lee said:
"I'm doing it under protest... I think it is fatuous. I can think of twenty adjectives – fatuous, pointless, absurd. It's not a comedy, but it's got a comic title. I don't see the point."[43]
Hammer Films had commercial success with some atypical output during this period, with film versions of several British TV situation comedies, most notably theITVseriesOn the Buses(1971). The first spin-off made was Hammer's biggest domestic earner of the 1970s and was popular enough to produce two sequels,Mutiny on the Buses(1972) andHoliday on the Buses(1973), seeing Hammer return to their pre-horror practice of adapting television properties for the cinema as they had once done withPC 49andDick Barton.
Other adaptations included:
In the latter part of the 1970s, Hammer made fewer films, and attempts were made to break away from the then-unfashionable Gothic horror films on which the studio had built its reputation.The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires(1974), a co-production withHong Kong'sShaw Brotherswhich attempted to combine Hammer's brand of horror with the then popularmartial arts genre, andTo the Devil a Daughter(1976), their third adaptation of aDennis Wheatleynovel, were both quite successful at the U.K. box office, but Hammer was unable to capitalise on them as most of the profits went to other financial backers.
Hammer Films struggled on throughout the 1970s before going into liquidation in 1979.[42]Hammer's last production, in 1979, was a remake ofAlfred Hitchcock's 1938 thrillerThe Lady Vanishes, starringElliott GouldandCybill Shepherd. (The Encyclopedia of British Filmcharacterized the remake as "about as witless and charmless as could be conceived".)[44]
In the 2000s, although the company seemed to be in hibernation, frequent announcements had been made of new projects. In 2003, for example, the studio announced plans to work with Australian company Pictures in Paradise to develop new horror films for the DVD and cinema market. On 10 May 2007, it was announced that Dutch producerJohn De Molhad purchased the Hammer Films rights via his private equity firm Cyrte Investments. In addition to holding the rights to over 300 Hammer films, De Mol's company plans to restart the studio. According to an article inVarietydetailing the transaction, the new Hammer Films was to be run by former Liberty Global execsSimon Oakesand Marc Schipper. In addition, Guy East andNigel Sinclairof L.A.-based Spitfire Pictures are on board to produce two to three horror films or thrillers a year for the U.K.-based studio. The first output under the new owners isBeyond the Rave, a contemporary vampire story which premièred free online, exclusively, on Myspace in April 2008 as a 20 × 4 min. serial.
The company began shooting a new horror/thriller film inCounty Donegalin 2008, backed by theIrish Film Board. The film is titledWake Woodand was scheduled for release in the United Kingdom in the autumn of 2009.[45]The film was produced in collaboration with the Swedish company Solid Entertainment, makers of the vampire filmFrostbiten, which pays homage to the Hammer vampire films among others. It was given a limited UK/Ireland theatrical release in March 2011. In the summer of 2009, Hammer produced in the U.S.The Resident,a thriller directed and co-written byFinnishfilmmakerAntti Jokinenand starringHilary Swank,Jeffrey Dean MorganandChristopher Lee.[46][47]It was released in the US and UK in March 2011. In 2010, Hammer, in partnership withOverture FilmsandRelativity Media, releasedLet Me In, a remake of Swedish vampire filmLet the Right One In.[48]
In June 2010, it was announced that Hammer acquiredWake, a script by Chris Borrelli for an action feature to be directed by Danish filmmakerKasper Barfoed.[49]In February 2012, the Hammer and Alliance Films adaptation ofThe Woman in Blackwas released.Daniel Radcliffestars as lawyer Arthur Kipps.Jane Goldmanwrote the film's screenplay, withJames Watkinsin the director's chair. In April 2012, the company announced it was to make a sequel toThe Woman in BlacktitledThe Woman in Black: Angel of Death. Also in 2012, Hammer and Alliance Films announced two more films going into production during 2012, entitledThe Quiet OnesandGaslight.[50]The Quiet Onestells the story of an unorthodox professor (Jared Harris) who uses controversial methods and leads his best students off the grid to take part in a dangerous experiment: to create a poltergeist. It was released on 10 April 2014 in the UK and 25 April in the US.
After a few quiet years, the filmThe Lodgehad its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon 25 January 2019. It was scheduled to be released on 15 November 2019, by NEON.
In September 2019, Hammer signed a worldwide distribution deal withStudioCanalfor its catalogue.[51]
In November 2021, it was announced Network Distributing had united with Hammer to form Hammer Studios Ltd.[52]In August 2023, it was announced Hammer Film Productions, its affiliated companies, and back catalogue had been acquired by theJohn Gore Organisation.[53]
In July 2022, Hammer Film Productions Ltd was incorporated by independent filmmaker and writer, Ronan Williams via Companies House in the UK.[54][55]
In my early teens I went with groups of friends to see certain films. If we saw the logo of Hammer, we knew it was going to be a very special picture. A surprising experience. And shocking.
Hammer's horror films were often praised by critics for their visual style, although rarely taken seriously. "Altogether this is a horrific film and sometimes a crude film, but by no means an unimpressive piece of melodramatic storytelling" wrote one critic ofDraculainThe Timesin 1958.[57]Critics who specialise in cult films, likeKim Newman, have praised Hammer Horror more fully, enjoying their atmosphere, craftsmanship and occasionalcampappeal. InA History of Horror,Mark Gatissremarked that Hammer's earlier films were taken seriously at the time, in comparison to the trademark camp appeal of their later works.
In a 2013 retrospective forThe Guardian, Michael Newton wrote:
Shot in Eastmancolor, the first batch of Hammer Horror movies – Terence Fisher'sThe Curse of Frankenstein(1957),Dracula(1958) andThe Mummy(1959) – are among the loveliest-looking British films of the decade... The early Hammer films offer a last gasp of British romanticism, the solid sets drenched in a soft brilliance of shadows, of greys, reds and blues; when these films stray into the far woods, it's always autumn there, never spring. The leaves fall, and the light shines golden and clear; compared with the well-lit contemporary look of the "angry young men" films, Hammer's mournful sumptuousness must have been even more striking. They play out a 1950s reverie of contagion, lust and post-Suezanxiety. Questions of guilt circulate in these films, where the virtuous can be transformed into vampires through one moment of sexual weakness...[58]
This was a fantasy, science fiction and supernaturalanthologyseries which dealt with normal people in everyday situations that found themselves having to experience something out of the ordinary. 17 episodes of approximately 50 minutes each were produced by Hammer Film Productions and20th Century Fox Television. In America, eight episodes from the series were broadcast as fourmade-for-television filmsconsisting of twinned episodes along with new segment introduction footage provided by actorsPatrick McGoohan,Sebastian CabotandJoan Crawfordserving as hosts.  The series was first aired onABCfrom 26 September, 1968 to 30 January, 1969, prior to broadcast in the UK onITVin 1969.
In 1980, Hammer Films created ananthologyseries for British television,Hammer House of Horror. Shown onITV, it ran for 13 episodes with a running length of approximately 54 minutes each. In a break from their cinema format, these self-contained episodes featuredplot twistswhich usually saw the protagonists fall into the hands of that episode's horror at the end. The series featured a different kind of horror each week, including witches, werewolves, ghosts, devil worship and voodoo, but also included non-supernatural horror themes such as cannibalism, confinement and serial killers. All the stories were set in contemporary England.
A second television anthology series,Hammer House of Mystery and Suspense, was produced in 1984 and ran for 13 episodes. The stories were originally to have been the same 54 min. length as their previous series, but it was decided to expand them to feature-length to market them as 'movies of the week' in the US. The running time varied from 69 to 73 minutes. The series was made in association with20th Century Fox(who broadcast films asFox Mystery Theater) and as such, the sex and violence seen in the earlier series was toned down considerably for US television. Each episode featured a star, often American, known to US viewers. This series was Hammer's final production of the 20th century, and the studio went into semi-permanent hiatus.

And I think experiencing both sides has been helpful. My father had mattresses on the floor of his apartments. He lived in cabins andtrailer parks. He just didn't have much money... Actually, my memories of growing up with him were so colourful and eccentric and fun. It was a good vibe, you know? When I was like eight I told him, 'I want to grow up and be poor like you!' He was eating a bowl of cereal. I didn't realize how wildly offensive that was!"[8]
Keough was raised primarily by her father inHawaiiandLos Angeles,[13]though she at times lived at her mother's Los Angeles home, as well as at theGraceland EstateinMemphis, Tennessee, which her mother inherited following her grandfather Elvis's death.[8]She is now the sole guardian of the estate and presides over the sub-trusts of her siblings, each inheriting one-third of their mother's estate including Graceland and the Elvis estate.[14]

In 2020, he played the lead role in theNetflixminiseriesThe Stranger.
After graduating from theLondon Academy of Music and Dramatic Art(LAMDA), Armitage initially sought theatre work and was a member of theRoyal Shakespeare Company(RSC). He turned to film and television roles when he noticed that leading stage roles went to actors with name recognition who could bring in patrons to fill venues. After twelve years away and having earned that name recognition, Armitage returned to the stage in 2014, taking his first leading role in a major production. He played John Proctor in the successful and critically acclaimed production ofThe CrucibleatThe Old Vic,[8][9]and earned anOlivier Awardnomination for Best Actor.[10]
One of Armitage's trademarks is hisbaritonevoice, which he has employed as a voice actor since 2006.

Armitage has recorded several audiobooks and has worked as a narrator on TV, radio shows, and adverts. In 2022, he ventured into video games for the first time, providing the voice of the Daemon Prince Be'lakor inTotal War: Warhammer III.[citation needed]
Armitage was born inLeicester, England, the younger son of Margaret, a secretary, and John Armitage, an engineer. He has an older brother named Christopher.[11]
He attended Huncote Community Primary School inHuncote,Blaby District, Leicestershire,[citation needed]and began secondary school at the local comprehensive school,Brockington CollegeinEnderby. At Brockington, Armitage pursued his interest in music – playing the cello in school and local orchestras, and learning how to play the flute. By the age of 14, having secured a grant from the Leicestershire Authority, he successfully persuaded his mother to allow him to transfer toPattison CollegeinCoventry, an independent school specialising in the performing arts, so that he could focus on drama and dance.[12][13][14]
Armitage has expressed gratitude for the lessons and opportunities Pattison College provided, saying "It... instilled me with a discipline that has stood me in good stead – never to be late, to know your lines and to be professional."[15]By the time he finished school, he had achievedA Levelsin music and English,[16]and acting experience in local amateur and professional productions such asShowboat,Half a Sixpence,Orpheus and the Underworld(asBacchus), andThe Hobbit(as an elf) at theNew Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham.[15]
After completing the programme at Pattison College in 1988, Armitage joined the Nachtcircus inBudapestfor six months to obtain hisEquity Card, a requirement at the time for entertainment professionals to work in the UK.[17][18]Returning to the UK, he pursued a career in musical theatre – working as an assistant choreographer to Kenn Oldfield and performing in various productions, including the ensembles of42nd Street,My One and Only,Nine,Annie Get Your Gunand asAdmetus and MacavityinCats.[19]Armitage was also pursuing acting in dramatic theatre productions, includingThe Real Thing,Six Degrees of SeparationandDeath of a Salesman.
By 1992, he began to doubt if musical theatre was the right career path, so he enrolled at theLondon Academy of Music and Dramatic Art(LAMDA) in 1993 to further study acting.[20][21]"I needed to do something a bit more truthful than musical theatre. For me it was a bit too theatrical and all about standing on stage and showing off. I was looking for something else, so that's why I went back to drama school."[22]
After completing LAMDA's three-year programme, he returned to the stage as a supporting player with theRoyal Shakespeare Company's productions ofMacbethandThe Duchess of Malfi, as well asHamletandFour Alice Bakerswith theBirmingham Repertory Theatrewhile taking a series of small roles in television and films.[23]In 2002 he starred in the Charm Offensive's production ofUse Me As Your Cardigan.[24]
That same year, Armitage appeared in his first major television role, as John Standring in theBBCdramaSparkhouse(2002).[25]"It was the first time I went to an audition in character. It was a minor role but it was something I really got my teeth into... I couldn't go back. I knew I had to approach everything the same way."[26]After this he took supporting roles in the TV productions ofBetween the Sheets,[27]Cold Feet(series 5),[28]andUltimate Force(series 2).[16][27]
In 2004, Armitage landed his first leading role as textile mill owner John Thornton in the BBC adaptation ofElizabeth Gaskell'sNorth & South.[29]The director and producers took a chance casting a little-known actor for their leading man. He was the first actor to audition for the role and the last person cast.[30]North & Southwas an unexpected success.[31]The BBC message boards crashed shortly after the telecast as a result of chatter about him[20]and he was hailed as the new "Mr. Darcy"[32][33](referring to Colin Firth's "Mr Darcy" whom many regard as the definitive romantic leading man). Armitage did not perceive John Thornton as the ideal romantic leading man role and was surprised by the response.[34]Instead, he said that he felt personally drawn to the role, as his father's family had been weavers. He cited Thornton's dualism as drawing him to the character. "The dichotomy between the powerful, almost monstrous, entrepreneur and this kind of vulnerable boy is exciting for me to look at."[30]
In 2005, he played PeterMacDuffinMacbethin the BBC'sShakespeaRe-Toldseries and appeared as a recovering gambling addict in one episode ofInspector Lynley Mysteries.[35]He starred inThe Impressionists, playing the youngClaude Monet,[36]and as Dr Alec Track in ITV'sThe Golden Hour, a medical series based on theLondon Air Ambulance.[37]His first substantial role in movies was in the independent filmFrozen.[38]
In 2006, Armitage was cast as Guy of Gisborne in the BBC seriesRobin Hood, which was filmed inHungary.[20]"In order to sustain the character of Guy, you have to find the conflict within him. He's constantly pulled between good and evil, between who he wants to be and who he actually is. He could have been a good man, but he is forever dragged down by his fatal flaw – that he wants glory at all costs."[39]Approaching the third series, he said, "I do love playing him, but with a character like Gisborne, if you give him what he needs, then in a way, it's over. That character is only interesting when he isn't getting what he wants, whether it's power, money or the girl."[40]The third and final series of Robin Hood started on 28 March 2009.
Armitage appeared in a two-part 2006/07 Christmas/New Years special ofThe Vicar of Dibley, as Harry Kennedy, the vicar's new love interest (and eventual husband).

"I love films with a combination of action and good characters. That's why Lucas is interesting as I get to play someone with a complex psychology who goes out there and tries to save the world."[41]During the filming of series 7 Armitage allowed himself to be subjected towaterboardingto film a flashback sequence.[42]In July 2010, Armitage completed filming of series 9, his final series.[43]

In May 2010, Armitage starred as formerSAStrooper John Porter inStrike Back(also known asChris Ryan's Strike Back) forSky1.[6]Filmed in South Africa, Armitage found the main challenge of the role was to show how the character resolved being a trained killer with having a family and home life.[44]"In the end it was the character I was attracted to, the story of a man who makes a decision under pressure and that decision has a knock-on effect on his whole life," he said. "He goes in search of atonement still believing he did the right thing even though it cost the lives of three of his friends... There's anger and there's injustice. It's like, 'I did the right thing, with the wrong outcome.'"[45]By the time Sky1 and Cinemax decided to commission a second series ofStrike BackcalledStrike Back: Project Dawn, Armitage had committed toThe Hobbitand was unable to continue in the series. However, he appeared as a guest star in the first episode to resolve John Porter's fate.[46][47]

Armitage thought it was a wonderful opportunity, as he grew up reading the books. Coincidentally, one of his first stage roles was playing anelfin a production ofThe Hobbitat the Alex Theatre inBirmingham.[50]He describes the character of Thorin as being complex and flawed, "somebody that had doubts and that had fears, and there was a gentle side to him and a very perhaps lonely side to him."[51]He notes the scene with Balin in Bag End shows the character's inner sensitivity and fear of failure, "failing where his father and his grandfather had failed as well."[51]

He has recorded many audiobooks: six based on BBC'sRobin Hood, Bernard Cornwell'sThe Lords of the North, threeGeorgette Heyernovels for Naxos AudioBooks (Sylvester, or the Wicked Uncle,Venetia, andThe Convenient Marriage),David Copperfieldby Charles Dickens for Audible Studios andHamlet, Prince of Denmark: A Novel. He has narrated television documentaries such asHomes from Hell,Empire's Children(2007),Too Poor for Posh School?,The Great Sperm Race,Forest Elephants: Rumble in the Jungle,Surgery School, andElsa: The Lioness That Changed the World. In 2011, he provided the narration for a series about theRoyal NavyflagshipHMSArk Royal,[104]125 Years of Wimbledon: You Cannot Be Serious, andFraud Squad. He has also provided the voice-over for many TV and radio advertisements, and stars as lead character Trevor Belmont in the Netflix animated seriesCastlevania.He has also voiced thetitle characterin the scripted podcastMarvel's Wolverine, and voicedRassilonin theDoctor Whoaudio spin-offGallifrey.
Armitage was hoping to star in a drama based onRichard III. Armitage was born on the anniversary of theBattle of Bosworth Field, where Richard III was killed and has said "I believe it is a great story, a socio-political thriller, a love story and a dynastic tragedy."[105]He thinks the story has the potential to be told as a twenty-episode miniseries. A script has been in development since 2010 and "a lot of people... are interested [in producing it], but there is no one that will step on the gas."[106]
Armitage has described himself as amethod actor. "Yeah, I suppose I am. In a way it's slightly lazy because it means you don't have to pretend – you just have to believe. As much as it's possible to be like that I suppose I kind of do step in and out, I'm not one of these people that can't talk to other people because I'm in my character, but I kind of do stay with the character, yeah. He's always there. It's like marinating something – you're sitting in a marinade the whole time."[107]He has also spoken of dreaming in character while playing John Porter and Thorin Oakenshield.[108][109]However, recently he rejected the label of "method actor." "I think I'm a concentrating actor. So in order to do my work in the course of a day, particularly with a character like this I have to concentrate. So it's about staying in the scene, staying with my head in the scene and attempting to keep the character with me. It doesn't mean I can't have a conversation or go and make a cup of coffee. But I actually stay with the character for 18 months."[110]
He frequently speaks of developing and being drawn to dualism in his characters.[106]"If I'm offered the role of the hero, I immediately look for theantiherowithin!... I see everything in terms of an outer skin and an inner skin."[111]He creates "character diaries" with entire biographies for the characters he plays. "It was important to me to put in a background for my character that would be useful for the whole journey. A lot of that is secret and no one gets to read that. It's what is useful to me. If you are playing something long-running and a role that has a future [beyond the initial series], it's almost like you have to plant a garden which you will need to come back to at some point. If you don't put in early, it can jar with you."[22]
Armitagecame outto his family at the age of 19.[112]In 2023, he publicly disclosed that he had a male partner.[113]

Her Scottish accent is good, her comic delivery is fresh, and she gets the maximum laugh value from each wobbly curtsey. Her character is the one thing in the show that Mamet gets absolutely right, although she is used a bit repetitively."[41]In the same year, she starred as a secretary in the theater productionSpeed-the-Plow, a satire of Hollywood executives.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
