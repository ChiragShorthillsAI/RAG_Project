Twenty-four-year-old high schooldropoutScott Carlin lives with his mother Margie and his sister Claire inStaten Island. Hisfirefighterfather Stan died fighting a fire when he was seven, a loss that continues to affect him; he also deals with numerous medical problems, includingCrohn's diseaseandADD, and smokesmarijuanaoften.
Unemployed, Scott spends his days hanging out with his friends, including Kelsey, whom he issleeping with. She wants the relationship to be more serious, but he fears commitment and that he is not good enough for her. Claire, who is leaving for college, is concerned Scott'sneurosesmay grow out of control with her gone.
Scott dreams of being atattoo artistand practices regularly on his friends, although his work is extremely inconsistent. One day, while hanging out with them at the beach, he is approached by 9-year-old Harold. Harold asks Scott to give him a tattoo, but runs off after getting a single line. Later, Harold's father, Ray, shows up at Scott's house.
Initially furious, Ray finds himself attracted to Margie and he eventually asks her out. Though she has not dated since Stan's death, she agrees. As things get more serious, Margie reveals their relationship to Scott, who is disturbed that he, like Stan, is a firefighter. Ray takes Scott to aStaten Island Yankeesgame with his co-workers but finds it difficult to talk to Scott, who argues that firefighters should not have families because of the pain that is caused by their deaths.
Margie and Ray give Scott an ultimatum to move out, which upsets him. While visiting Claire, he tells her he plans to break up their mom and Ray, as the relationship is 'unhealthy'. Scott gets a job as abusboy, and begins walking Harold and his sister Kelly to school each day, growing close with them.
Meanwhile, Scott's friends plan to rob apharmacyforoxycodonepills to sell. He is uncomfortable with the plan but agrees to be thelookout. The robbery goes awry when the pharmacist and his wife confront them. Oscar is shot and all three are arrested, but Scott flees.
Scott talks with Ray's ex-wife Gina, who tells him several negative things about Ray, painting him as a homelessgambling addict. He relays this to Margie, only to end up in a physical confrontation with Ray when he hears what Scott told her. A furious Margie kicks both men out.
With his friends in jail, Scott struggles to find a place to stay. He hopes that Kelsey will let him stay with her after they sleep together, but she is indignant when she recognizes his ulterior motives and refuses. Desperate, Scott goes to Ray'sfirehouse, where he is told he may stay in return for doing chores.
Scott gradually bonds with Ray and the other firefighters, who tell him stories about his father, which humanizes him and helps Scott accept his death. Ray learns from Harold that Scott is a talented artist, and agrees to let him tattoo his back as practice, but within certain limits.
One day, a man shows up at the firehouse with an abdominal wound while Scott is there alone. He takes him to the hospital, where Ray arrives, using his firefighter connections to get the man the help he needs. Margie, who works as anemergency roomnurse, sees Scott and Ray and reconciles with them both.
Ray shows Margie his tattoos; a number of them are offensive or violate his criteria, but the most prominent is one of Margie, Ray, Scott, and Claire together (plus their dad as the sun). Scott surprises Kelsey at theStaten Island Ferry, where she is heading intoManhattanto take acivil service exam. He rides on the ferry with her, where he confesses his love for her, and they kiss. Kelsey heads into the exam, asking him to wait for her.

He also wrote and directed several episodes of the series. After its cancellation, Apatow was the executive producer and creator of the seriesUndeclared, which reusedSeth Rogenin the main cast and otherFreaks and Geekscast members in recurring roles. Although both shows were quickly canceled,USA Todaymedia critic Susan Wloszczyna called the shows "two of the most acclaimed TV series to ever last only one season".[30]

Apatow wrote the initial draft of the film on the set ofTalladega Nights.[20]The story concerns a slacker and a media personality (Rogen and Heigl, respectively) whoseone-night standresults in an unintended pregnancy. In addition to being a critical success, the film was also a commercial hit, continuing Apatow's newfound mainstream success.[citation needed]
In August 2007, Apatow produced the filmSuperbad, which was written bySeth Rogenand his writing partnerEvan Goldberg. A concept Rogen and Goldberg had created as teens, Apatow convinced Rogen to write the film as a vehicle for himself in 2000. Rogen and Goldberg finished writing the film, but were unable to find a studio interested in producing it. Apatow then enlisted Rogen and Goldberg to writePineapple Express, astoneraction movie that he felt would be more commercial. After the success ofAnchormanandThe 40-Year-Old Virgin, Apatow was still unable to sell bothSuperbadandPineapple Express; it was only after he produced the commercial hitTalladega NightsthatSony Pictures Entertainmentdecided to produce both.[25]
At this point, Rogen was unable to play the lead forSuperbad, as he had grown too old to play the part of Seth. Subsequently, he was cast in a supporting role as a police officer and friendJonah Hilltook his role as the high school student. Apatow credits Rogen for influencing him to make his work more "outrageously dirty".[20]
In August 2007,Superbadopened at No. 1 in the box office to critical acclaim, taking in $33 million in its opening weekend.[36]Industry insiders claimed Apatow was now a brand unto himself, creating movies geared toward older audiences, who would watch his movies even when the films delved into the teen genre.[37]
Apatow served as producer and co-writer along with directorJake Kasdanfor the biopic spoofWalk HardstarringJohn C. Reilly,Kristen WiigandJenna Fischer, which was released in December 2007.[38]While the film received positive reviews,[39]it did poorly commercially.[40]In 2008, he served as producer forDrillbit Taylorstarring Owen Wilson andLeslie Mannand written bySeth Rogen, which opened in March and earned negative reviews.[41]
For the rest of 2008, Apatow produced the comedy filmsForgetting Sarah MarshallstarringJason SegelandKristen Bell;Step Brothers, which reunitesTalladega Nightsco-starsWill FerrellandJohn C. Reilly; andPineapple Expressstarring Seth Rogen andJames Franco, both of whom originally starred onFreaks and Geeks. In addition, he served as co-writer for theAdam Sandlercomedy filmYou Don't Mess with the Zohan, which Sandler andRobert Smigelalso co-wrote and went on to gross $204 million at the worldwide box office.[42][43]
He tries to keep a low budget on his projects and usually makes his movies about the work itself rather than using big stars. After his success in film, he hired the entire writing staff fromUndeclaredto write movies forApatow Productions.[20]He never fires writers and he keeps them on projects through all stages of productions, known colloquially as "the comedy wheel".[20]Apatow is not committed to any specific studio, but his projects are typically set up atUniversalandSony,[20]and in 2009Varietyreported that Universal had signed him to a 3 picture directing deal.[44]Apatow once vowed to include a penis in every one of his movies.[45]He explained his position as, "I like movies that are, you know, uplifting and hopeful...and I like filth!"[46]
In 2009, Apatow served as producer for the biblical comedy filmYear One; the film was not well received.[47]He also released his third directorial feature on July 31 that same year, titledFunny People. Apatow wrote the film, which starredAdam SandlerandSeth Rogenas a pair of standup comedians, one of whom has a terminal illness. Other co-stars included his wifeLeslie MannandEric Bana, who was a comedic actor in Australia before appearing in American films. The film contained more dramatic elements than Apatow's previous directorial efforts.[48]Although the film was not financially successful (grossing $54 million domestically), the critical reception was primarily positive, with David Denby ofThe New Yorkermagazine including the film on his top ten films of 2009,[49]callingFunny People"a serious comedy about a funny man's brush with death" and stating that the film "is Apatow's richest, most complicated movie yet—a summing up of his feelings about comedy and its relation to the rest of existence."[50]New York TimescriticA.O. Scott, reflecting on summer films of 2009, opined thatFunny Peoplewas "a movie about growing up, feeling sad, facing death—a long, serious film whose subject is the challenge of maturity. Which may be why, in the face of a softish opening weekend, various interpreters of box office data were quick to declareFunny Peoplea flop. The summer is no time for grown-ups."[51]
In 2010, Apatow served as producer on theForgetting Sarah Marshallspin-offGet Him to the GreekwithRussell Brandreprising his role andJonah Hillreturning from the original film, albeit as a different character.

The series ran from 2012 to 2017 and generating criticism over its depiction of sexual assault,[55]male ejaculate,[56]and Dunham's frequent on-screen nudity.[57][58]In a January 2013 interview inFast Company, Apatow and Dunham discussed the creative process of working on the show, saying that "this type of show is an auteur's vision. It isn't collaborative in the same way as other shows. We are probably closer toCurb Your Enthusiasmthan we are to something likeFriends."[59]
Apatow producedWanderlust(2012), starringJennifer AnistonandPaul Ruddas a married couple who leave New York City and live in a hippie commune.[60]He also producedThe Five-Year Engagement(2012), featuringJason SegelandEmily Bluntas a couple who have a rocky five-year engagement.[61]

In 2012,Entertainment Weeklyreported that 22 years after writing an episode ofThe Simpsons, Apatow's script ("Bart's New Friend")[64]was being developed into an episode that would air in 2015.[65]Apatow co-producedAnchorman 2: The Legend Continues, which was released December 18, 2013, with the plot focusing on "Ron Burgundy's struggle to find his place in the rise of new media and the 24-hour news cycle".[66]Apatow producedBegin Again(2013), starringKeira Knightleywho plays a singer-songwriter who is discovered by a struggling record label executive (played byMark Ruffalo) and collaborates with him to produce an album recorded in public locations all over New York City.

In his comedy, Garry Shandling always was in pursuit of the truth and contemplating real life. With this two-partHBOspecial, he and Judd Apatow achieved that very beautifully one last time."[91]In September 2018, Apatow took home the outstanding documentary or nonfiction special award at theCreative Arts Emmy Awardsfor his work on the documentary.[92]

ActressKatherine Heiglsaid in 2007 that though she enjoyed working with Apatow onKnocked Up, she found the film itself "a littlesexist" and felt it "paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys."[97][98][99]Apatow responded, "I'm just shocked she used the wordshrew. I mean, what is this, the 1600s?"[100]Apatow said the characters in the film "are sexist at times... but it's really about immature people who are afraid of women and relationships and learn to grow up."[101]
In 2012, Alyssa Rosenberg ofThinkProgressquoted Apatow as saying, "I got bored of penises. I said, 'enough of that.' No, I just like immaturity, I like to show people struggle and try to figure out who they are. I'm a guy and so it leaned guy for a while. But one of the projects I'm most proud of isFreaks and Geeks, which is about a woman in high school struggling to figure out which group she wants to belong to, so for me, it goes back and forth."[102]

Sirus's most well-known character is faux reporter Brick Stone, who became famous for his interviews with members of theWestboro Baptist Churchwhere he ambushes and harasses them with absurd or explicit questions. He interviewed the Westboro Baptist Church in-character as they were protesting the Golden Globes January 12, 2014.[5]A number of former Westboro Baptist Church members who first encountered Stone while he was counter-protesting them would later reach out to Sirus to discuss the church, including Zach Phelps-Roper.[6]He has produced other interview videos as his Brick Stone character with Occupy Wall Street residents, conspiracy theorists, street preachers, gay pride marchers, and the general public.[7]
Sirus ceased performing the Brick Stone character in 2015 largely due to his schedule: he hoped to bring the character back to cover election cycles, but found the material was too similar to his work on Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.

Marisa Tomei was born on December 4, 1964, inBrooklyn, New York City, to Adelaide "Addie" (néeBianchi), an English teacher, and Gary A. Tomei, a trial lawyer.[7]She has a younger brother, actor Adam Tomei,[8]and was partly raised by her paternal grandparents.[9]Tomei's parents are both ofItaliandescent; her father's ancestors came fromTuscany,Calabria, andCampania, while her mother's ancestors are from Tuscany andSicily.[10][11]She graduated fromEdward R. Murrow High Schoolin 1982.[12][13]
Tomei grew up in theMidwoodneighborhood of Brooklyn.[14]While there, she became captivated by theBroadwayshows to which her theater-loving parents took her and was drawn to acting as a career. At Andries Hudde Junior High School, she played Hedy LaRue in a school production ofHow to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. She also attended Albee School of Dance. After graduating from high school, she attendedBoston Universityfor a year.[9]
Tomei followed upAs the World Turnsin 1987 with a main role on thesitcomA Different Worldas Maggie Lauten during the first season. Her film debut was a minor role in the 1984comedy filmThe Flamingo Kid, in which she played Mandy, a waitress. She had only one line in the film. In 1986 she had a small role in theBobandHarvey Weinsteindirected comedy filmPlaying for Keepswhich was a financial and critical failure.
During this phase, she made her stage debut in 1987 at the age of 22 in the off-Broadway playDaughters, playing Cetta. The role earned her rave reviews and theTheatre World Awardfor outstanding debut on stage. She continued to take roles off-Broadway in the playsBeirutin 1987,Sharon and Billyin 1988, andWhat the Butler Sawin 1989.

Following several small films, includingOscar,[15]Tomei came to international prominence with her comedic performance in the 1992 filmMy Cousin Vinnystarring oppositeJoe Pescifor which she received critical praise.[16]CriticVincent Canbywrote, "Ms. Tomei gives every indication of being a fine comedian, whether towering overMr. Pesciand trying to look small, or arguing about a leaky faucet in terms that demonstrate her knowledge of plumbing. Mona Lisa is also a first-rate auto mechanic, which comes in handy in the untying of the knotted story."[17]For her performance, Tomei was namedBest Supporting Actressat the1993 Academy Awards, prevailing overMiranda Richardson,Joan Plowright,Vanessa RedgraveandJudy Davis.
American film criticRex Reedcreated controversy (and a minor Hollywood myth)[18][19][20]when he suggested thatJack Palancehad announced the wrong name after opening the envelope.[21][22]While this allegation was repeatedly disproved[23][24]—even theAcademyofficially denied it[22]—Tomei called the story "extremely hurtful". APrice Waterhouseaccountant explained that if such an event had occurred, "we have an agreement with the Academy that one of us would step on stage, introduce ourselves, and say the presenter misspoke."[25]In 2015, whenThe Hollywood Reporterpolled hundreds of academy members, asking them to re-vote on some past decisions, Academy members indicated that, given a second chance, they would still award the 1992 Best Supporting Actress award to Tomei.[26]

She then appeared inNick Cassavetes'Unhook the Stars. Of Tomei's performance,Stephen HoldenofThe New York Timescompared her favorably to the film's star,Gena Rowlands, writing, "Ms. Tomei is equally fine as Mildred's [Rowlands' character's] younger, hot-tempered neighbor, whose raw working-class feistiness and bluntly profane vocabulary initially repel the genteel older woman."[27]She received her firstScreen Actors Guildaward nomination for OutstandingFemale Supporting Actorfor her performance.
In 1998, she was nominated for theAmerican Comedy Awardfor Funniest Supporting Actress forTamara Jenkins'cult filmSlums of Beverly Hills. The independent feature was well received by critics and the public,[28]withJanet MaslinofThe New York Timeswriting, "Jenkins makes the most of an especially ingratiating cast, with Ms. Tomei very charming and funny as Rita,"[29]andEmanuel LevyofVarietydescribing Tomei as "spunky and sexy... more subdued than she usually is."[30]Tomei spent several years away from high-profile roles[why?]and major motion pictures in the late 1990s before rising again to prominence in the early 2000s.[31]

Simpson murder trial.[33]
In 1998 she made herBroadwaydebut playing Susy Hendrix	in the revival of theFrederick KnottplayWait Until Darkacting oppositeQuentin Tarantinoat theBrooks Atkinson Theatre.[34]Ben BrantleyofThe New York Timescompared her performance unfavorably toAudrey Hepburnwho played the role in the1967 film. Brantley wrote, "[Tomei]'s a fine, vibrant actress, and heaven knows she works hard here, but she isn't well cast. The appeal of [Hepburn] in the part was of seeing her fragile, ladylike persona turn tough and muscular, and Ms. Tomei's performance allows for no similar transition".[3]Matt Wolf ofVarietywrote "Tomei gives a likable, if not wildly interesting performance".[35]
Tomei appeared in theNancy Meyersdirected comedyWhat Women WantstarringMel GibsonandHelen Hunt. The film was a commercial success. She also had a supporting role in the romantic comedySomeone Like YoustarringAshley Judd,Hugh Jackman, andGreg Kinnear.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
