The Rentalis a 2020 Americanhorror filmco-written, produced and directed byDave Franco, in his feature directorial debut. Franco co-wrote the screenplay withJoe Swanbergfrom a story by Franco, Swanberg, and Mike Demski. It starsDan Stevens,Alison Brie,Sheila Vand,Jeremy Allen White, andToby Huss, and follows two couples who begin to suspect they are being watched in the house they rented.
The film was released on video-on-demand and in select theaters in the United States on July 24, 2020, byIFC Films. It received generally positive reviews from critics, and became the second film to ever topvideo-on-demand(VOD) charts and the box office in the same weekend.
Charlie, his wife Michelle, his brother Josh, and Josh's girlfriend/Charlie's business partner Mina rent a remote house on theOregon Coastfor a weekend getaway. The caretaker Taylor gives them the housekey, but they get a negative impression of him. In the evening, Michelle gives the othersMDMA(ecstasy), but she doesn't take any herself and goes to bed early. After Josh passes out on the couch, Mina and Charlie kiss in the hot tub and have sex in the shower.
The next morning, Michelle and Josh leave for a hike. Charlie and Mina agree their one-night stand was a mistake and will remain a secret. While taking a shower, Mina discovers a hidden camera and alerts Charlie; the two believe Taylor installed it. Charlie stops her from calling the police, fearing Michelle and Josh would learn of their affair. He assures her that Taylor would not reveal the footage because he would have to admit spying on them.
That night, Josh realizes his dog is missing, while Michelle takes ecstasy and calls Taylor over to fix the hot tub. Josh is suspicious that Taylor may have taken the dog, so he confronts Taylor upon his arrival, but he denies it. Taylor fixes the hot tub, and Mina privately confronts him about the hidden camera in the shower, which he claims to be unaware of. Mina threatens to call the police but Taylor calls her bluff and they start arguing loudly. Josh rushes in and, assuming Taylor was attacking Mina, beats him unconscious. Mina is forced to reveal the hidden camera, but while the group discusses what to do outside, a masked stranger sneaks in and suffocates Taylor. When the others find Taylor dead in the bathroom, they assume that he died from Josh's beating.
Frantic, Michelle demands they call the police, but Charlie refuses, unwilling to let Josh, who has previously been incarcerated, return to prison. He suggests staging Taylor's death as an accident by throwing him off the cliff into the ocean. Michelle refuses to take part and goes to the bedroom. The other three carry Taylor's body to the cliff. It falls onto an outcrop, forcing Josh to go down and push it into the sea. Back at the house, Michelle is lured into a room where a TV plays the footage of Charlie and Mina having sex. Michelle angrily confronts Charlie and drives off. Down the road, she runs over metal spikes, crashes into a tree, and is attacked by the stranger while texting Charlie for help.
Charlie goes to search for Michelle. He finds her dead body on the road and is then attacked and murdered by the stranger. Back at the house, Mina and Josh are looking for the shower camera's transceiver to destroy any footage it recorded. Josh receives a video from Charlie's phone showing him and Mina having sex. Josh then hears someone enter the house and, thinking it is Charlie, rushes to confront him. Instead, the stranger attacks and kills Josh as Mina flees. Pursued through the forest in darkness and fog, she accidentally runs off a cliff and falls into the ocean.
The stranger returns to the house, removing all evidence and surveillance equipment. As he is about to leave, Josh's dog enters through the back door.  The killer pets the dog gently and departs. He rents a new property and installs cameras in it to carry out further serial killings. We see several couples through these cameras, and at the end he emerges from a closet to attack a sleeping couple.

Writing for theChicago Sun-Times,Richard Roepergave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying: "The Rentalwould have worked purely as a compelling character study about four dysfunctional adults unraveling over the course of a long weekend — but when the presence of a homicidal maniac is introduced to the proceedings, the transition to horror film is brilliant and wacky and pretty darn great."[19]Owen GleibermanofVarietysaid the film had "tense flavor and skill" and wrote: "There's some crafty artistry at work inThe Rental, and also some fairly standard pandering, which feels like a violation of the movie's better instincts. That said, most of it is skillful and engrossing enough to establish Franco as a director to watch."[20]In a negative review, Oliver Jones of theObserversaid the film’s ideas aren’t fully explored or developed enough, which results in "a tweener: a film that is part infidelity drama and partslasher filmwhile never fully committing to either idea."[21]Jones added the plot felt "paper-thin" and the characters insubstantial, concluding "there are seeds of ideas about the toxicity of aspirational real estate and those that indifferently own it that could have possibly have flowered into something worth exploring."[21]
Franco has voiced his interest in a sequel, saying: "It was the intention from the beginning to leave the ending ambiguous enough that we carry on the story if given a chance... I have a very strong idea for what I would want to do with a sequel."[9]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
