The film premiered at the 2020Screamfest Horror Film Festivalon October 6, 2020, and was released onHuluthe following day.[1][2]This was the final production byTouchstone Televisionbefore being folded into20th Television.[3]
The film tells three stories, two of which are loose adaptations from the titular horror fiction anthology:"The Book of Blood"("Miles") and"On Jerusalem Street" (a postscript)("Bennett").
Jenna Branson is a college student suffering from amental illnessthat makes the smallest of noises overwhelming for her. Unhappy at home, she decides to run away after becoming noncompliant with her medication. She begins to suspect that someone is following her and takes refuge at abed and breakfastrun by older couple Ellie and Sam Austin. Jenna bonds with a fellow guest named Gavin, and with her host, Ellie. She begins to feel a connection with Ellie after experiencing delusions of bugs and continuing to see someone following her. She is horrified when she discovers that the couple have been paralysing their guests, sewing their eyes shut, removing their tongues and ears, and hiding them within the house. Ellie uses her skills as a former health practitioner to keep her victims 
alive but sedated in the walls and hidden compartments of her home, in a warped belief that her actions are providing Ellie and Sam's victims with a better life.
Jenna is saved by her stalker, revealed to be the father of Jenna's former boyfriend who died by suicide. He is murdered by Ellie and Sam. His body is put in his car, which is driven away by Sam. Jenna manages to get into the backseat of the car and subsequently ends up trapped in the car as it goes over a cliff in a fake suicide set up by Ellie and Sam to dispose of the body of Jenna's former boyfriend's father.
Mary Floresky is approached by apsychicnamed Simon McNeal, who claims that he is communicating with her dead son Miles. While she is skeptical, Mary truly wishes to speak to her son and decides that this could be a beneficial experiment for her work. The experiment is seemingly successful and the two end up becoming a couple, also launching a foundation together. This happiness does not last, as Mary eventually discovers that not only is Simon unfaithful but he alsofaked the entire experiment. Later a devastated Mary sees her son's ghost and watches as a message entreats her to repeat the experiment with Simon.
Simon is initially unwilling to participate but does so when she mentions that it is necessary to raise funding for her work. Later Simon is in the room as multiple ghosts appear and carve their stories into his flesh.
A bookseller owes money to shady people and Bennett has been hired to collect, along with his driver Steve. When he is unable to produce what is owed, the seller attempts to save his life by telling Bennett of the "Book of Blood", a rare tome worth a million dollars, that's located in an abandoned town. Bennett is intrigued by the story, but still kills the bookseller.
Together with Steve, Bennett travels to the abandoned town where both men experience inexplicable and supernatural phenomena. Steve is driven to shoot himself after hearing the voice of his dead mother, while Bennett is chased by their car. When he arrives at the purported location of the book, he discovers Mary, Simon, and the ghost of Miles. Bennett is unwilling to believe that Simon is the book, particularly after Mary tells him that he is now one of the stories. He is then chased outside, where he is tormented by visions until he stabs himself. Though severely wounded, Bennett manages to escape but is unfortunate in that he ends up at Ellie and Sam's home, where he is killed by Ellie.
Then, the scene moves to a hospitalized Jenna, who survived the crash. We have a flashback of her last phone call with her boyfriend, and we learn that she instigated him to jump from a roof. She cries as she recalls it, and returns to the evil couple, letting them drug and mutilate her like the others. Jenna is shown to be happy as she can no longer hear noises.
All these stories appear to be written on Simon's back, and read by Mary.

It was launched on October 29, 2007, initially as ajoint venturebetweenNews Corporation(later21st Century Fox) andNBC Universal, which was laterbought byComcast. Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initiallybrandedas "Hulu Plus," which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and un-delayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—anover-the-topstreaming television service offering access tobroadcast televisionchannels.
In 2011, Hulu launchedits services in Japan, marking its first and only international expansion. Three years later in 2014, Hulu Japan was acquired byNippon TVand spun off from its American counterpart.[2]Since February 2021, Hulu's original content has since been distributed outside of the U.S. viaDisney+under theStarbrand. In 2019, Disney acquired a majority stake in Hulu as part of itsacquisition of 21st Century Fox, and subsequently acquired the remaining stakes held by AT&T and Comcast in 2019 and 2023, respectively, giving it full ownership. After the acquisition, Disneysoft launchedan integration of Hulu into Disney+ as a content hub in December 2023, allowing subscribers of both services to access Hulu content from within the Disney+ app. Hulu is one of the three streaming services in the Disney Bundle, alongside Disney+ andESPN+.
On January 6, 2025, Disney began its acquisition of a 70% stake inFuboTV, with the latter merging with Hulu's Live TV service. The combined company will remain publicly traded on theNew York Stock Exchange, but will be controlled by Disney executives. As part of the deal, Fubo settled a lawsuit againstESPN Inc.(majority-owned by Disney),Fox Corporation(21CF's successor), andWarner Bros. Discovery(WarnerMedia's successor after its merger withDiscovery, Inc.) over a joint venture known asVenu Sports, with Fubo being granted a preliminary injection to stop its launch in August 2024. The merger will take 12 to 18 months according to Disney and Fubo. Venu Sports was discontinued a few days later.
The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

It invited users to leave their email addresses for the upcomingbeta test.[13]In October 2007, Hulu began the private beta testing by invitation, and later allowed users to invite friends.[14]Hulu launched for public access in the United States on March 12, 2008.[15]
Hulu began an advertising campaign during NBC's broadcast ofSuper Bowl XLIIIwith an initial ad starringAlec Baldwintitled "Alec in Huluwood."[16]Advertisements have since aired featuringEliza Dushku,Seth MacFarlane,Denis Leary, andWill Arnett.[citation needed]
In July 2007,Providence Equity, the owner ofNewport Television, became one of the earliest "outside" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 millionequity investment,[17]before the company was known as "Hulu."[18]With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an "independent voice on the board."[18]In April 2009,the Walt Disney Companyjoined the Hulu consortium as a stakeholder, with plans to offer content fromABC,ESPNandDisney Channel.[19][20][21][22]
Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

Under the agreement, Comcast's 33% stake can be sold to Disney atfair market valueas early as 2024. The fair market value will be determined at that time, but Disney guaranteed a minimum valuation of the entire company at $27.5 billion (valuing the Comcast stake as worth at least $9.075 billion).[39]Randy Freer would report to Disney executiveKevin Mayer.[39]

However, Comcast had not offered reasonable terms for an early buyout[54]and had instead expressed interest in buying Hulu themselves if it were for sale.[53]

He plays a humorous version of himself, pitching a project and getting barred from the studio lot, in the famous opening-shot ofRobert Altman'sThe Player(1992). He previously appeared, thinly veiled, as a fictional character inChristopher Guest's filmThe Big Picture(1989) and would reappear inKim Newman's novelJohnny Alucard(2013), where he again pitches a project and becomes the only person in Hollywood standing up to a particularly sinister studio executive.[1]
Kim Newman has noted that Adam Simon has "become one of the most oft-cited figures in contemporary Hollywood satire, and those in the know have begun to play the game of Simon-spotting. [...] Remarkable look- and act-alikes for Adam Simon have appeared in a couple of sinister Hollywood satires: Adam Rafkin (Jarrad Paul) on the cancelled-too-soon TV seriesAction, who ruins his emotional and physical health on successive drafts ofBeverly Hills Gun Clubfor sleazy überproducer Peter Dragon (Jay Mohr); and Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) in David Lynch'sMulholland Drive, who finds his entire life - and film project - jeopardised when he considers going against the wishes of backers who represent either organised crime or Hell."[2]

And I didn't want to be. I spent years turning down other lesbian roles because it felt like going back to Beth. [But it] did also make me want to take on parts that showed extreme sides of women".[12]In 1995, Friel won aNational Television Awardin the category of "Most Popular Actress" for her work onBrookside.[13]
Upon leaving the show, a decision that she initially thought to be a "terrible mistake",[14]Friel was cast in an episode ofTales from the Cryptand appeared as one of the main characters inStephen Poliakoff's television filmThe Tribe(1998), which attracted controversy for its inclusion of aménage à troissex scene.[15]She then played leading roles in small-screen adaptations ofCharles Dickens'Our Mutual FriendandRobert Louis Stevenson'sSt. Ives(both 1998), and co-starred in several British films, such as wartime period dramaThe Land Girls(1998),[16]crime dramaRogue Trader(1999), and slapstick comedyMad Cows(1999).[17]While most were dismissive ofCow's eccentric humour, some critics felt that Friel's work as Australian expatriate Maddy was impressive.[18][19]Next, she playedHermiain the 1999 film version ofWilliam Shakespeare'sA Midsummer Night's Dream,[20]saying later of the experience, "I think that [role] sort of changed things for me, especially in America, because the cast was really great—Kevin Kline,Michelle Pfeiffer,Christian Bale—and people started to think, 'if she's working with [those people] she must be doing well'".[21]
During that same period, Friel made herBroadwaydebut in a production ofPatrick Marber'sCloser, which ran for 173 performances at theMusic Box Theatrein New York (March–August 1999).[22]In his review of the show forVariety,Charles Isherwoodwrote:
It's the exquisitely lovely Friel who is the discovery here. Her Alice is both the nihilistic core of the play and its tender center, and the paradoxical mixture of toughness and fragility [she] brings to it are essential to the play's deepest truths. It's a star-making performance.[23]
For her work as exotic dancer Alice, Friel won that year'sDrama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play.[24]

In his appraisal ofYouforVariety, David Rooney said, "Of the central duo, Friel has the most difficult job, playing an essentially unsympathetic brat … But [she] continually tempers the negatives with a vulnerability and insecurity that redeem her".[29]Between March and May 2001, Friel appeared in an adaptation ofFrank Wedekind'sLuluat theAlmeida Theatre; herWest Endstage debut.[30][31]Describing her portrayal of the titular Victorian sex worker, theatre criticNicholas de Jonghfelt, "The appeal of Miss Friel's [performance] depends upon its restraint, guile and cool", noting that she mixes "child-like glee and naughtiness" with a "calm and callous" demeanour.[32]The play transferred to theKennedy CenterinWashington, D.C.for one month following its run at the Almeida.[33]
Friel's next roles were in the Irish television filmWatermelon(2003), where she starred as a headstrongDublingirl who travels to England for an abortion,[34]and theRichard Donnerfantasy adventure filmTimeline(2003), where she played the love interest of the main character. She was then cast as Attorney Megan Delaney inThe Jury, an American legal drama series that ran onFoxfor a single season in 2004. Writing forThe New York Times,Alessandra Stanleycalled the show "clever, innovative", and said of Friel, "hers is the most textured and persuasive character".[35]Friel later admitted to finding the job a challenge: "Everyone was saying, 'you will never believe how much hard work it is', and I was telling them not to worry because I'm used to it … but my God were they right … You run off the set from one scene and get changed and run back on. It is so fast and so very well organised but it is hard, hard bloody work".[21]Next, she playedGeordienurse Roz in the British-American sports dramaGoal!(2005; a part she reprised in itssequel) and appeared as a recovering drug addict in theToronto-setNiagara Motel(2006).

TheNBCshow ran for a single season between April and June 2015, with some critics comparing it unfavourably toHomeland; though Friel's performance was roundly praised.[67][68][69][70]She starred that same year in the World War II-set Norwegian miniseriesThe Heavy Water War(known elsewhere asThe Saboteurs),[71]and in the drama filmUrban and the Shed Crew, based on the memoir of the same name.[72]Her next major film projects were the independent dark comedyThe Cleanse, revenge thrillerI.T.(both 2016), and the Irish-Canadian crime dramaTomato Red(2017), where her role as atrailer trashmother drew attention for beingagainst type.[73][74]
Friel began playing the eponymous Marcella Backland in the BritishNordic noirdetective series,Marcella, in 2016. Speaking of her decision to take on the part—a former policewoman who returns to work to investigate an unsolved serial killer case—she told a journalist prior to the debut of thesecond season, "I nearly pulled out of [the job] after I'd accepted it [because] I just thought, 'Oh God, how can I do this? There are so many amazing female detectives that have done it so well, I don't know what I can offer differently' … so when [the first season] was received as well as it was, I thought maybe I had done something that is different and I've put my own ownership and my own stamp on it".[75]In 2019, Friel collected theInternational Emmy Award for Best Actressfor her portrayal of Backland,[76]whichDeciderfelt was "extraordinary":
Friel is a master of expressions. From scene to scene the actress' face can shift from chilling hard stares to wide-eyed looks of terror. It's never completely clear what Marcella is thinking or what she's going to do next. Not only does this allow Friel to explore her wide range, but it adds to the unsettling tone of this show.[77]
Marcella's third andfinal seasondebuted onNetflixin 2020,[78]with Friel commenting afterwards that a fourth season was unlikely to happen.[79]
On thesecond seasonofThe Girlfriend Experience(2017), ananthologydrama series produced bySteven Soderberghfor theStarznetwork, Friel played Erica Myles, an ambitious financier engaged indom-subpartnerships with multiple women. Her performance was described as "outstanding" byThe Atlantic[80]and "fantastic" byVariety, who added, "sometimes [the camera] just focuses on her eyes, which can either well up with frustrated tears or shutter in Erica's emotions, as changeable as the sky reflected in a lake".[81]Referring to the series' intense work schedule and the explicit nature of its sex scenes, Friel said that the role was her "most challenging job to date".[82]That same year, she was nominated for theBritish Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actressfor her portrayal of a destitute mother in the six-part BBC dramaBroken,[83]withMetro's Sarah Deen noting, "Friel excellently [plays] Christina's frantic desperation … all wild eyes, flapping shoes and dry humour ('I went to Mass and I got the sack. What am I gonna get tomorrow? Cystitis?'). You couldn't tell if her wit was genuine or hastily developed as a defence mechanism to stop her from bursting into tears".[84]
In the ITV drama seriesButterfly, which aired over three weeks in October 2018, Friel starred as Vicky, the parent of atransgenderchild.Lucy ManganofThe Guardiancalled the show "important, truthful ... a wonderfully delicate drama that covers new ground carefully and features fully realised characters",[85]while theNew Statesmanfelt that Friel's portrayal of a mother "racked by guilt" was "sterling".[86]Friel said she and the show's creators felt a great responsibility to make it as realistic as possible: "We met all these wonderful families, who were saying, 'please tell our story and tell it properly'. I said, 'do you not feel represented?' And they said 'no'. People have so many comments and opinions, but they actually can be somewhat ill-informed".[87]The following year, Friel headlined the six-part miniseriesDeep Water, whichMetrodescribed as a "dark soap opera", adding, "The performances, with a very human and relatable nasty streak running through each one, [elevate it] to a must-binge drama … Friel excels when it comes to playing harassed women, usually ones with a secret to keep, and the actress completely [disappears] into [her character] as she [fights] to get her marriage back".[88]
In the 2020 horror filmBooks of Blood, Friel played Mary, a grieving mother who makes contact with her late son.[89]Based on a collection of stories byClive Barker,Bloodreceived mixed reviews,[90]though critics remarked that Friel's work was strong.[91][92]Her next project was the starring role of Sharon Pici, aKansas Citydetective, inViaplay's seven-part psychological thrillerThe Box(2021).[93]The following year, she co-headlined the Fox musical drama seriesMonarchoppositeSusan Sarandon. Friel played Nicolette "Nicky" Roman, a singer-songwriter trying to continue her family's legacy while forging her own path in thecountry musicindustry. In his review forThe A.V. Club, Max Gao said:
Friel, not Sarandon, is the show'srealleading lady—and a pretty great one at that … She belts out song after song, delivers memorable, fast-paced one-liners in a Texas accent ("I was going to say be careful about the rats, but there's no need because… you're going to fit right in"), and plays Nicky with such steadfast conviction that it's easy to wonder why she hasn't been more successful on this side of the pond since starring in ABC'sPushing Daisies… thankfully [this is] a role that is worthy of her talents.[94]
Friel performed every song that her character sings—a mixture of covers and originals—herself.[95]It was announced in December 2022 that the series had been cancelled after one season.[96]
In the period drama filmCharming the Hearts of Men(2021), Friel played Grace Gordon, a woman fighting forcivil rightsin 1960s Southern America. Her work drew acclaim,[97][98]withFilm Threatcommenting that her "lived-in" performance was key toHearts'success.[99]She then appeared as Nicky, aLiverpudliannurse helping one of her patients unravel a dark secret, in the British psychological thrillerLocked In(2023).[100]
Friel has featured in print and television advertising campaigns for brands such asReebok,Virgin Atlantic,Mulberry,Three,Pantene, andMarks & Spencer.[101][102][103][104][105][106]

Friel works as an ambassador for theWWFwildlife charity.[108][109]
In 2001, Friel began a relationship with actorDavid Thewlis, after the pair met on a flight toCannes.[110]Later that year, Friel collapsed and was rushed to a hospital, needing emergency surgery and two blood transfusions for a rupturedovarian cyst.[111]It was discovered that she suffers fromendometriosisand would have difficulty conceiving.[112]Despite this, she later became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter, Gracie Ellen Mary Friel, on 9 July 2005 atPortland Hospital, London.[113]Gracie was named afterGracie Fields, and her mother's grandmothers, Ellen and Mary. In December 2010, Friel and Thewlis separated after almost ten years together.[114]Friel dated actorRhys Ifansfrom 2011 to 2014.[115][116]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
