The film premiered at theVenice Film Festivalon September 6, 2019. It was released on August 7, 2020, bySamuel Goldwyn Films. It received a lukewarm critical response.
The Magistrate manages an outpost on the desert frontiers of an unnamed Empire. His careful management has kept the peace for many years and there are only minor misunderstandings. All that changes with the arrival of Colonel Joll, who is acting as part of a mysterious plan set in motion by the centre of the empire. The Magistrate tries his best, but Colonel Joll remains antagonistic.  Colonel Joll insists on interrogating an innocent man and his nephew for sheep rustling. Colonel Joll is determined to follow his process for getting the truth, which requires brutal torture. The Magistrate does not understand Joll, or his methods, or his goals. Colonel Joll then forces the tortured nephew to escort him and a detachment of soldiers to his tribe, where numerous women and elderly men are taken into custody as "prisoners of war".
Colonel Joll departs the next day, prompting the Magistrate to immediately release the prisoners and send them home. A few months later, a former prisoner with two broken ankles is seen panhandling in the streets. The Magistrate gives her food and shelter, and attempts to heal her broken ankles. Some of the soldiers mistake this act of kindness for an act of lust, believing that the Magistrate intends to keep the girl as aconcubine. The Magistrate learns of all the tortures and hardships the girl has gone through, including the death of her father. He asks her to stay at the fort, but promises to return her to her people if she does not wish to stay. The girl chooses the latter.
After a long and arduous journey through the desert, the Magistrate approaches the nomads in the mountains hoping to restore relations with them, but the nomads are upset and only the Magistrate's reputation and the knowledge that he helped one of their own keeps the tribesmen from butchering him and his escorts. The Magistrate returns to find Officer Mandel, Colonel Joll's underling, has been assigned to command the fort. Officer Mandel immediately takes the Magistrate into custody, accuses him oftreachery, and strips him of his office.
The Magistrate is eventually released, but when he tries to help "prisoners of war" being mistreated by Mandel's soldiers, the soldiers beat and abuse him. He is then brought in for questioning and accused of consorting with the enemy for helping the nomad girl. The Magistrate is publicly shamed and has his home and possessions confiscated, while Colonel Joll departs with a large force to wipe out the mountain nomads. The Magistrate, now disheveled, poor, homeless, and ostracized by his countrymen, is taken in by one of his former servants, who feeds and clothes him.
Colonel Joll's military campaign has resulted in the unification of the dispersed nomadic tribes into a single "barbarian" army. A horse carrying the mutilated corpse of one of Colonel Joll's men walks into the fort. Officer Mandel quickly leaves with some of his men. Those left behind soon decide to flee as well but not before looting, raping and murdering the townpeople. Later Colonel Joll returns with only a handful of survivors. The Magistrate finds him  sitting in his coach completely detached from reality. With no supplies or horses, they leave while being pelted by rocks.
The Magistrate walks through the town where boys play-pretend to stand guard next to scarecrows dressed as soldiers at the gates of the fort. While he thinks of the nomad girl living in the desert, a shadow approaches the Magistrate, who is standing alone in the courtyard, and a cloud of dust appears on the horizon thrown up by an immense army of nomadic warriors heading towards the town.

John Maxwell Coetzee[a]FRSLOMG(born 9 February 1940) is a South African and Australian novelist, essayist, linguist, translator and recipient of the2003 Nobel Prize in Literature. He is one of the most critically acclaimed and decorated authors in theEnglish language. He has won theBooker Prize(twice), theCNA Literary Award(thrice), theJerusalem Prize, thePrix Femina étranger, andThe Irish TimesInternational Fiction Prize, and holds a number of other awards andhonorary doctorates.
Coetzee moved to Australia in 2002 and became an Australian citizen in 2006. He lives inAdelaide,South Australia. He is patron of theJ. M. Coetzee Centre for Creative Practiceat theUniversity of Adelaide. His most recently published book isThe Pole and Other Stories(2023).
Coetzee was born inCape Town,Cape Province,Union of South Africa, on 9 February 1940 toAfrikanerparents.[2][3]His father, Zacharias Coetzee (1912–1988), was an occasional attorney and government employee, and his mother, Vera Coetzee (née Wehmeyer; 1904–1986), a schoolteacher.[4][5]His father was often absent, and enlisted in the army and fought in World War II to avoid being prosecuted on a criminal charge. Vera and her children therefore relied on financial and other support from relatives.[6]The family mainly spoke English at home, but Coetzee spokeAfrikaanswith other relatives.[4]
He is descended from 17th-century Dutch immigrants to South Africa,[6][7]on his father's side, and from Dutch, German, and Polish immigrants through his mother.[8][9]His mother's grandfather was a Pole, referred to by the Germanised form, Balthazar du Biel, but actually born Balcer Dubiel in 1844 in the village ofCzarnylas(Schwarzwald), in a part of Poland annexed byPrussia. His ancestry caused a lifelong preoccupation with Polish literature and culture, culminating in his 2022 novelThe Pole.[10]
Coetzee spent most of his early life in Cape Town and inWorcester, a town in the Cape Province (modern-dayWestern Cape), as recounted in his fictionalised memoir,Boyhood(1997). His family moved to Worcester when he was eight, after his father lost his government job.[5]Coetzee attended St. Joseph's College, aCatholic schoolin the Cape Town suburbRondebosch.[11]He studied mathematics and English at theUniversity of Cape Town(UCT), receiving a Bachelor of Arts with honours in English in 1960 and a Bachelor of Arts with honours in mathematics in 1961.[12][13]
Coetzee moved to theUnited Kingdomin 1962 and worked as acomputer programmerforIBMinLondonand ICT (International Computers and Tabulators) inBracknell, staying until 1965.[4]His experiences in England are recounted inYouth(2002), his second volume of fictionalised memoirs.
In 1963, theUniversity of Cape Townawarded Coetzee aMaster of Artsdegree for his thesisThe Works ofFord Madox Fordwith Particular Reference to the Novels(1963).[4][14]
In 1965, Coetzee went to theUniversity of Texas at Austin[b]in the United States and enrolled inbibliographyandOld Englishcourses. While there, he taught students at the university, and also wrote a paper on themorphologyof theNama,Malay, andDutch languagesfor linguist Archibald A. Hill,[16]who taught at the university.[17][18]His PhD dissertation was a computer-aidedstylistic analysisof the English prose ofSamuel Beckett.[19]After leaving Texas in 1968, he was awarded hisdoctoratein 1969.[20]
In 1968, Coetzee began teaching English literature at theState University of New York at Buffalo, where he stayed until 1971. At Buffalo, he began his first novel,Dusklands.[4]
From as early as 1968, Coetzee sought permanent residence in the U.S., a process that was finally unsuccessful, in part due to his involvement inprotests against the war in Vietnam. In March 1970, he was one of 45 faculty members who occupied the university'sHayes Halland were arrested for criminal trespass.[21]The charges against them were dropped in 1971.[4]
In 1972, Coetzee returned to South Africa and was appointed lecturer in the Department of English Language and Literature at theUniversity of Cape Town. He was promoted to senior lecturer andassociate professorbefore becoming Professor of General Literature in 1984. In 1994 Coetzee became Arderne Professor in English, and in 1999 he was appointed Distinguished Professor in the Faculty of Humanities. Upon retirement in 2002, he was awardedemeritusstatus.[22][23]
He served on theCommittee on Social Thoughtat theUniversity of Chicagountil 2003.[24]
After relocating to Adelaide, Australia,[8]Coetzee was made an honoraryresearch fellowat the English Department of theUniversity of Adelaide,[25]where his partner, Dorothy Driver,[12]is a fellow academic.[26]As of November 2023[update], Coetzee is listed as University Professorial Research Fellow within the School of Humanities[27]
Coetzee's first novel wasDusklands(1974), and he has published a novel about every three years since. He has also written autobiographical novels, short fiction, translations fromDutchandAfrikaans, and numerous essays and works of criticism. His latest work isThe Pole and Other Stories(2023). He has not written a novel set in South Africa since 2009.[28]
According toJames Meek, writing inThe Guardianin 2009: "SinceDisgrace, the nature of Coetzee's project has changed. He has moved away from naturalistic, storytelling fiction towards other forms—essays, polemic and memoir, or a composite of all three in a fictional framework... [he] seems to be taking less interest in the storytelling keel of his books and is inviting us instead to listen in to an intimate conversation he is having with himself, in the form of multiple alter egos". These alter egos include a character type represented by the magistrate inWaiting for the Barbariansand David Lurie inDisgrace; another is a female proxy for himself, the "elderly, scholarly, world-weary novelist" Elizabeth Costello, a recurring character in his works; and the last is Coetzee himself, writing autobiographically. Meek also remarks that Coetzee is harsh on himself, in the characters who represent him in some ways.[29]
Relating to his developing interest inArgentine literaturein the 2010s, Coetzee's trilogy of novelsThe Childhood of Jesus,The Schooldays of Jesus, andThe Death of Jesusreflect his preoccupation with and evolution of his ideas and views on language ("I do not like the way in which English is taking over the world... I don't like the arrogance that this situation breeds in its native speakers. Therefore, I do what little I can to resist the hegemony of the English language"). All three were translated into Spanish, with the last published in Spanish translation first. He also became involved with theLiteratures of the Southproject during this period (2015).[30]
The Polewas first published in Spanish asEl polaco, in Argentina, in 2022, and in English the next year.[28]
Coetzee is one of the most critically acclaimed and decorated authors in theEnglish language.[4][6][12][22]He has received numerous awards throughout his career, although he has a reputation for avoiding award ceremonies.[31]
Coetzee was the first writer to be awarded the Booker Prize twice: forLife & Times of Michael Kin 1983, and forDisgracein 1999.[32][33]As of 2020[update], three other authors have achieved this,Peter Carey,Hilary Mantel, andMargaret Atwood.[34]
Summertime, named on the 2009 longlist,[35]was an early favourite to win Coetzee an unprecedented third Booker Prize.[36][37]It made the shortlist, but lost to bookmakers' favouriteWolf Hall, by Mantel.[38]Coetzee was also longlisted in 2003 forElizabeth Costelloand in 2005 forSlow Man.
The Schooldays of Jesus, a follow-up to his 2013 novelThe Childhood of Jesus, was longlisted for the 2016 Booker Prize.[39]
On 2 October 2003, theSwedish Academyannounced that Coetzee had been chosen as that year's recipient of theNobel Prize in Literature, making him the fourth African writer to be so honoured[40]and the second South African, afterNadine Gordimer.[41]When awarding the prize, the Swedish Academy stated that Coetzee "in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider".[42]The press release for the award also cited his "well-crafted composition, pregnant dialogue and analytical brilliance", while focusing on the moral nature of his work.[42]The prize ceremony was held inStockholmon 10 December 2003.[41]
Coetzee is a three-time winner of South Africa'sCNA Literary Award(in 1977, 1980 and 1983).[43][44]HisWaiting for the Barbariansreceived both theJames Tait Black Memorial Prizeand theGeoffrey Faber Memorial Prize,[45]Age of Ironwas awarded theSunday ExpressBook of the Yearaward,[46]andThe Master of Petersburgwas awardedThe Irish TimesInternational Fiction Prize in 1995.[47]He has also won the FrenchPrix Femina étrangerand twoCommonwealth Writers' Prizesfor the African region, forMaster of St Petersburgin 1995 and forDisgracein 2000 (the latter personally presented byQueen Elizabeth IIatBuckingham Palace),[48]and the 1987Jerusalem Prizefor the Freedom of the Individual in Society.[45][46][49]In 1998, he received theLannan Literary Awardfor Fiction.[50]
In 1984, Coetzee received an Honorary Fellow Award at the University of Cape Town.[20]He was elected a Fellow of theRoyal Society of Literature(FRSL) in 1988.[51]In 2001 he won the Outstanding Alumnus award at the University of Texas.[20]In 2004, he was made Honorary Fellow of theAustralian Academy of the Humanities.[20]
On 27 September 2005, the South African government awarded Coetzee theOrder of Mapungubwe(gold class) for his "exceptional contribution in the field of literature and for putting South Africa on the world stage".[52]In 2006, he was elected to theAmerican Philosophical Society.[53]He holds honorary doctorates fromThe American University of Paris(2010),[20][54]the University of Adelaide (2005),[20][55]La Trobe University,[56]theUniversity of Natal(1996),[20]theUniversity of Oxford,[57]Rhodes University,[58]the State University of New York at Buffalo,[46]theUniversity of Strathclyde,[46]theUniversity of Technology, Sydney,[59]theAdam Mickiewicz University in Poznań,[60]and theUniversidad Iberoamericana.[61]
In 2013, Richard Poplak of theDaily Maverickcalled Coetzee "inarguably the most celebrated and decorated living English-language author".[62]
Coetzee first visited Adelaide in 1996, when he was invited to appear atAdelaide Writers' Week.[63]He made subsequent appearances at the festival in 2004,[64]2010[65](when he introducedGeoff Dyer),[66]and 2019 (when he introducedMarlene van Niekerk).[67]
In 2004, theLord Mayor of Adelaidehanded Coetzee thekeys to the city.[63][20]
In 2010, Coetzee was made an international ambassador forAdelaide Writers' Week, along with American novelistSusanna Mooreand English poetMichael Hulse.[68]
Coetzee is patron of theJ. M. Coetzee Centre for Creative Practice(JMCCCP), a research centre and cultural hub founded at the University of Adelaide in 2015. The centre runs workshops with the aim of providing "a stimulating environment for emerging and established writers, scholars and musicians". Coetzee's work provides particular inspiration to encourage engagement with social and political issues, as well as music. The centre was established in 2015.[69]
In November 2014, Coetzee was honoured with a three-dayacademic conference, "JM Coetzee in the World", in Adelaide. It was called "the culmination of an enormous collaborative effort and the first event of its kind in Australia" and "a reflection of the deep esteem in which John Coetzee is held by Australian academia".[70]
From 9 to 10 November 2023, a celebration of Nobel Prize in Literature anniversaries, commemorating the winning of the prize by Coetzee in 2003 andPatrick Whitein 1973, was organised by the head of JMCCCP,Anne Pender, and held by the University of Adelaide. The program included several events over two days, including readings in the reading room of theBarr Smith Libraryby Coetzee,Christos Tsiolkas,Patrick Flanery,Helen Garner,Brian Castro, and others; music byAnna GoldsworthyandPaul Grabowsky; and screenings ofDisgraceandThe Eye of the Storm, which included talks by the filmmakers, at thePalace Nova Eastend Cinema.[71][72]
According toFred Pfeil, Coetzee,André BrinkandBreyten Breytenbachwere at "the forefront of the anti-apartheid movement within Afrikaner literature and letters".[73]On accepting the Jerusalem Prize in 1987, Coetzee spoke of the limitations of art in South African society, whose structures had resulted in "deformed and stunted relations between human beings" and "a deformed and stunted inner life". He added, "South African literature is a literature in bondage. It is a less than fully human literature. It is exactly the kind of literature you would expect people to write from prison", and called on the South African government to abandon its apartheid policy.[49]The scholar Isidore Diala wrote that Coetzee, Nadine Gordimer, and Brink are "three of South Africa's most distinguished white writers, all with definite anti-apartheid commitment".[74]
It has been argued that Coetzee's 1999 novelDisgraceallegorises South Africa'sTruth and Reconciliation Commission(TRC).[75]Asked about his views on the TRC, Coetzee said, "In a state with no official religion, the TRC was somewhat anomalous: a court of a certain kind based to a large degree on Christian teaching and on a strand of Christian teaching accepted in their hearts by only a tiny proportion of the citizenry. Only the future will tell what the TRC managed to achieve".[76]
After his Australian citizenship ceremony, Coetzee said: "I did not so much leave South Africa, a country with which I retain strong emotional ties, but come to Australia. I came because from the time of my first visit in 1991, I was attracted by the free and generous spirit of the people, by the beauty of the land itself and—when I first saw Adelaide—by the grace of the city that I now have the honour of calling my home."[25]When he moved to Australia, Coetzee cited the South African government's lax attitude tocrime in that countryas a reason, leading to a spat withThabo Mbeki, who said, "South Africa is not only a place of rape", referencing Coetzee'sDisgrace.[77]In 1999, theAfrican National Congress's submission to aSouth African Human Rights Commissioninvestigation into racism in the media said thatDisgracedepicted racist stereotypes.[78]When Coetzee won the Nobel Prize, Mbeki congratulated him "on behalf of the South African nation and indeed the continent of Africa".[79]
Coetzee has never specified any political orientation nor overtly criticisedapartheid, though he has alluded to politics in his work, especially the part that language plays in supporting the political and social structures of colonialism and nationalism. South African authorNadine Gordimersuggested that Coetzee had "a revulsion against all political and revolutionary solutions", and he has been both praised for his condemnation of racism in his writing and criticised for not explicitly denouncing apartheid.[28]
Writing about his past in thethird person, Coetzee wrote inDoubling the Point:
Politically, theraznochinetscan go either way. But during his student years he, this person, this subject, my subject, steers clear of the right. As a child inWorcesterhe has seen enough of the Afrikaner right, enough of its rant, to last him a lifetime. In fact, even before Worcester, he has perhaps seen more of cruelty and violence than should have been allowed to a child. So as a student, he moves on the fringes of the left without being part of the left. Sympathetic to the human concerns of the left, he is alienated, when the crunch comes, by its language—by all political language, in fact.[80]
Asked about the latter part of this quote in an interview, Coetzee answered: "There is no longer a left worth speaking of, and a language of the left. The language of politics, with its new economistic bent, is even more repellent than it was 15 years ago".[76]
In February 2016, Coetzee was one of 61 signatories to a letter to Australian prime ministerMalcolm Turnbulland immigration ministerPeter Duttoncondemning their government's policy ofoffshore detention of asylum seekers.[81]
In 2005, Coetzee criticisedcontemporary anti-terrorismlaws as resembling those of South Africa's apartheid regime: "I used to think that the people who created [South Africa's] laws that effectively suspended the rule of law were moral barbarians. Now I know they were just pioneers ahead of their time."[82]The main character in Coetzee's 2007 bookDiary of a Bad Year, which has been described as blending "memoir with fiction, academic criticism with novelistic narration" and refusing "to recognize the border that has traditionally separatedpolitical theoryfrom fictional narrative",[83]shares similar concerns about the policies ofJohn HowardandGeorge W. Bush.[84]
In recent years, Coetzee has become a vocal critic ofcruelty to animalsand an advocate ofanimal rights.[85]In a speech given on his behalf byHugo Weavingin Sydney on 22 February 2007, Coetzee railed against the modernanimal husbandryindustry.[86]The speech was forVoiceless, an Australian nonprofit animal protection organization of which Coetzee became a patron in 2004.[87]Coetzee's fiction has similarly engaged with animal cruelty and animal welfare, especiallyThe Lives of Animals,Disgrace,Elizabeth Costello, andThe Old Woman and the Cats. He is avegetarian.[88]
In 2008, at the behest ofJohn Banville, who alerted him to the matter, Coetzee wrote toThe Irish Timesof his opposition toTrinity College Dublin's use ofvivisectionon animals for scientific research. He wrote: "I support the sentiments expressed by John Banville. There is no good reason—in fact, there has never been any good reason, scientific or pedagogical—to require students to cut up living animals. Trinity College brings shame on itself by continuing with the practice."[89]Nearly nine years later, when TCD's continued (and, indeed, increasing) practice of vivisection featured in the news, a listener to theRTÉ Radio 1weekday afternoon showLivelinepointed out that Banville had previously raised the matter but been ignored. Banville then telephonedLivelineto call the practice "absolutely disgraceful" and recalled how his and Coetzee's efforts to intervene had been to no avail: "I was passing by the front gates of Trinity one day and there was a group of mostly young women protesting and I was interested. I went over and I spoke to them and they said that vivisection experiments were being carried out in the college. This was a great surprise to me and a great shock, so I wrote a letter of protest toThe Irish Times. Some lady professor from Trinity wrote back essentially saying Mr. Banville should stick to his books and leave us scientists to our valuable work." Asked if he received any other support for his stance in the letter he sent toThe Irish Times, Banville replied, "No. I became entirely dispirited and I thought, 'Just shut up, John. Stay out of it because I'm not going to do any good'. If I had done any good I would have kept it on. I mean, I got John Coetzee—you know, the famous novelist J. M. Coetzee—I got him to write a letter toThe Irish Times. I asked a lot of people."[90]
Coetzee wanted to be a candidate in the2014 European Parliament electionfor the DutchParty for the Animals, but the Dutch election board rejected his candidacy, arguing that candidates had to prove legal residence in the European Union.[91]
In the early 1960s, while in London,[30]Coetzee studiedSpanish,[28]and from 2015 to 2018, Coetzee was a director of a biannual seminar series on the Literatures of the South at theUniversidad Nacional de San Martínin Argentina.[28][92]This involved writers and literary figures from Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and South America.[93][94]The aim of the seminars, one observer remarked, was "to develop comparative perspectives on the literature" and journalism of the three areas, "to establish new intellectual networks, and to build a corpus of translated works from across the South through collaborative publishing ventures".[95]He developed an interest inArgentine literature, and curated a series for the publishing house El Hilo de Ariadna, which includesTolstoy'sThe Death of Ivan Ilyich,Samuel Beckett'sWatt, andPatrick White'sThe Solid Mandala. His trilogy of novelsThe Childhood of Jesus,The Schooldays of Jesus, andThe Death of Jesusreflect his preoccupation and evolution of ideas and views on language.[30]
At the same time, he was involved in a research project in Australia, Other Worlds: Forms of World Literature, for which he led a theme on "Everyday Pleasures" that is also focused on the literatures of the South.[96]Coetzee chose to publishThe Schooldays of JesusandThe Death of Jesusin Australia, andThe Polein Argentina, before they were published in the U.K. or the U.S. In an interview withEl Pais, he said, "the symbolism of publishing in the South before the North is important to me".[28][97]
When asked in 2015 to address unofficial Iranian translations of foreign works — Iran does not recognize international copyright agreements — Coetzee stated his disapproval of the practice on moral grounds and wished to have it sent to journalistic organisations in that country.[98]
Coetzee was a key figure in the establishment ofOak Tree Press'sFirst Chapter Seriesin 2006.[99]The series produces limited-edition signed works by literary greats to raise money for the child victims and orphans of theAfrican HIV/AIDS crisis.[100]
Coetzee has mentioned a number of literary figures who, like him, have tried "to transcend their national and historical contexts":Rainer Maria Rilke,Jorge Luis Borges,Samuel Beckett,James Joyce,T.S. Eliot,Ezra Pound, andZbigniew Herbert—outsiders to Western culture who moved countries and/or wrote in different languages.[28]He has said, "as a child, as a young man, as a student, I had absolutely no doubt that access to the English language was liberating me from the narrow world view of the Afrikaner", and "I have a good command of English, spoken and written, but more and more it feels to me like the kind of command that a foreigner might have".[30]He has written about his feeling of being an "outsider", such as his experience of being a colonial when living in London, which he writes about inYouth, and characters in his novels have sometimes been outsiders.[14]
On 6 March 2006, Coetzee became an Australian citizen,[25][101]and it has been argued that his "acquired 'Australianness' is deliberately adopted and stressed" by Australians.[70]
Coetzee is generally reluctant to speak about himself and his work, but has written about himself in several autobiographical novels (Boyhood,Youth, andSummertime).[14]He has been described as reclusive, avoiding publicity to such an extent that he did not collect either of his two Booker Prizes in person.[77][102]The South African writerRian Malan, in oft-quoted words from an article published in theNew Statesmanin 1999, called Coetzee "a man of almost monkish self-discipline and dedication", and reported—based on hearsay—that he rarely laughed or even spoke.[103][104]Asked about these comments in an email interview, Coetzee replied: "I have met Rian Malan only once in my life. He does not know me and is not qualified to talk about my character".[105][106]
Coetzee married Philippa Jubber in 1963.[107]They divorced in 1980.[5]They had a son, Nicolas (born 1966), and a daughter, Gisela (born 1968).[107]Nicolas died in 1989 at the age of 23 after accidentally falling from the balcony of hisJohannesburgapartment.[5][107][108][109][110][111]
Coetzee's younger brother, the journalistDavid Coetzee, died in 2010.[112]
His partner,Dorothy Driver, is an academic at theUniversity of Adelaide.[12][26]

But I've met Prince Charles a number of times now – because he's a great lover of Shakespeare – and I think he's a very conscious person and a good influence. ... Partly, in the end, I felt that because I have an interest in a number of subjects that people try to write off, like Shakespeare's authorship or crop circles – they say I'm insane or not mentally stable – that somehow, a knighthood makes it a little less easy to write me off.[61]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
