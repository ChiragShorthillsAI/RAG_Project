Gaz, Nathan, and Terry have decided to break into the home of Dr. Richard Huggins and his wife Ellen, as it is in the countryside and is said to have a very large safe full of cash. Nathan's girlfriend, Mary complicates matters when she arrives to retrieve her car to go to work, however, she is persuaded to come along. She enters the house after the boys fail to access the safe, as she had been waiting outside for a long while.
Once inside, she tells Nathan that she is pregnant. When the Hugginses return, the boys tie the couple up and attempt to threaten them into opening the safe. In the process, Richard recognises Nathan and Terry from when they were children which causes Nathan to become reluctant to continue the theft. In an attempt to take control, Gaz picks a fight with Nathan and stabs him. He then ties up Ellen and tries to hurt her with a circular saw after Richard lies about the combination to the safe twice, only for Mary to kill him with a sledgehammer. As she and Terry untie the couple, Ellen seems to recognise Mary.
Richard deceives Mary by offering to operate on Nathan and pretending to call for an ambulance while Ellen offers to nurse Terry's injured foot. When Mary sees Ellen coddling Terry then reassuringly kissing his bare buttocks after administering an injection, she realises that they have been tricked. After being secretly drugged by Ellen, Terry hallucinates Mary's twin sister Jane, who went missing a few months back and is presumed to have run away. Richard tries to persuade Mary and Terry to drink tea with them, during which they discuss the untimely death of the couple's daughter, Kate, years prior, as well as the mysterious disappearances of numerous teenage girls in the area. Now aware of the danger the couple poses, Mary tries unsuccessfully to escape. She and a paralysed Terry make it to the garage and she tries to drive away in a van belonging to the Huggins, only for Terry to shoot her in the back as she puts the van into drive.
As she bleeds out, Richard taunts Mary about her impending death, despite acknowledging that she saved him and his wife from Gaz. He also tells her that he and his wife have kidnapped and imprisoned several girls in their safe, which is actually a vault where they would dress them up as little girls and call them "Kate". It's insinuated that the girls who did not work out were killed and disposed of. However, the most recent girl they kidnapped did fit the role. And when Richard opens the vault it is revealed that Mary's sister, Jane is inside. Mary finally succumbs to blood loss, with the last thing she sees being her long-lost sister in chains. As a reward for helping them, the Hugginses imprison Terry inside the vault with Jane.
The film ends with Terry's mother discussing her son's disappearance with the Hugginses, unaware of the couple's involvement and the presence of Mary's freshly buried corpse in the garden, presumably alongside Gaz and Nathan.

Percy James Patrick Kent-Smith(born 20 August 1943), known professionally asSylvester McCoy, is a Scottish actor. Gaining prominence as aphysical comedian,[1][2]he became best known for playing theseventh incarnationofthe Doctorin the long-runningscience fiction televisionseriesDoctor Whofrom 1987 to 1989—the final Doctor of the original run—and briefly returning in atelevision film in 1996. He is also known for his work asRadagastinThe Hobbitfilm series (2012–2014).
McCoy was born Percy James Patrick Kent-Smith[3]inDunoon, on theCowalpeninsula, to an Irish Catholic mother and an English father who had died in action duringWorld War IIa couple of months before McCoy was born;[4]he met his father's family at the age of 17.[3]His mother suffered amental breakdownwhen McCoy was eight years old, and was institutionalised thereafter.[5]Prior to adopting his stage name, McCoy was known as Kent Smith; he was unaware of his given names until he was eleven.[5]
McCoy was raised primarily in Dunoon,[3]where he attended Saint Mun's School; he then studied for the priesthood atBlairs College, aseminaryin Aberdeen between the ages of 12 and 16,[3]but gave this up and continued his education atDunoon Grammar School.[4]After school he moved to London where he worked in the insurance industry for five years.[6]He worked in the box office ofThe Roundhousefor a time, where he was discovered byKen Campbell.[7]
McCoy came to prominence as a member of the experimental theatre troupe "The Ken Campbell Roadshow". His best known act was as astuntmancharacter called "Sylveste McCoy" in a play entitledAn Evening with Sylveste McCoy(the name was coined by actorBrian Murphy, who worked beside Kent-Smith at theRoundhouse Theatreand originated in the Wolfe Tones version of "Big Strong Man"[8]), where his stunts included putting a fork and nails up his nose and stuffingferretsdown his trousers, and setting his head on fire. As a joke, the programme notes listed Sylveste McCoy as played by "Sylveste McCoy" and, conscious that he may have needed to distinguish himself from the American actorKent Smithas his career progressed, Kent-Smith maintained the stage name. Canadian criticMilton Shulmanbelieved McCoy's name and fictionalised biography were genuine in his review of the Roadshow.[5]
Notable television appearances before he gained the role of the Doctor included roles inVision On(where he played Pepe/Epep, a character who lived in the mirror), an O-Man inJigsawandTiswas. Every episode of the innovativeATVschools maths programmeLeapfrogfeatured McCoy as "Bert" in wordless sequences filmed out of doors, as he attempted to form regular geometric patterns from different numbers of logs or carpet squares. He also appeared inEureka, often suffering from the effects of inventions ofWilf Lunn, and as Wart, assistant to StarStrider in the Children's ITV seriesof the same name. McCoy also portrayed, in one-man shows on the stage, two famous movie comedians:Stan LaurelandBuster Keaton. While playing Laurel, who had adopted his stage name due to the perceived bad luck of his real name containing thirteen letters, McCoy realised his stage name also had thirteen letters and added an "r" to the end of "Sylveste".[5]He also appeared asHenry "Birdie" Bowersin the 1985 television serial aboutScott'slastAntarctic expedition,The Last Place on Earth.
McCoy also had a small role in the 1979 filmDraculaoppositeLaurence OlivierandDonald Pleasence, and has sung with theWelsh National Opera.
McCoy became theSeventh Doctorafter taking over the lead role inDoctor Whoin 1987 fromColin Baker. He remained on the series until it ended in 1989, ending withSurvival(his twelfth and final serial as the Doctor). As Baker declined the invitation to film the regeneration scene, McCoy briefly wore a wig and appeared, face-down until the last moment before the regeneration commenced as the Sixth Doctor, with his face concealed by regeneration special effects. He played the Doctor in the 1993 charity specialDimensions in Time, and again in 1996, appearing in the beginning of theDoctor Whotelevision movie starringPaul McGannas theEighth Doctor.
In his first season, McCoy used his background inphysical comedyto portray the character with a degree of clown-like humour, butscript editorAndrew Cartmelsoon changed that when fans argued that the character (and plots) were becoming increasingly lightweight. The Seventh Doctor developed into a much darker figure than any of his earlier incarnations, manipulating people like chess pieces and always seeming to be playing a deeper game. A distinguishing feature of McCoy's performances was his manner of speech. He used his natural Scottish accent and rolled hisrs. At the start of his tenure he used proverbs and sayings adapted to his own ends (e.g. "There's many a slap twixt cup and lap" –Delta and the Bannermen), although this characteristic was phased out during the later, darker series of his tenure. In 1990, readers ofDoctor Who Magazinevoted McCoy's Doctor "Best Doctor", over perennial favouriteTom Baker.[9]Since 1999 he has continued acting in the role of the Seventh Doctor in a series of audio plays forBig Finish Productions.
In November 2013 McCoy co-starred in the one-off 50th anniversary comedy homageThe Five(ish) Doctors Reboot.[10]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron.

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
