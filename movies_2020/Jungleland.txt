Walter "Lion" Kaminski, a talented former professional boxer and his brother Stanley, an ex-con and Lion's idealistic manager, work menial jobs in a sewing factory. At night, the pair participate inundergroundboxingmatches, often squatting at a dilapidated house in the slums ofFall River, Massachusettswith their whippet Ash.
Stanley is in debt to Pepper, a localgangster, and in order to pay off, he allows the money to ride on Lion for their next fight. During the fight, Pepper shows up to watch and Lion realizes that Stanley bet on him to win; he angrily throws the fight. An enraged Pepper beats Stanley, but sees potential in Lion due to his skill. He proposes that they pay off the debt by completing a task: to drive a young girl named Sky toReno, Nevadabefore having Lion compete at an underground prizefight called "Jungleland" inSan Francisco's Chinatown.
Having no choice, Stanley agrees and Pepper provides him with cash, anSUV, and apistol. Along the way, they stop at a bar where Sky befriends Lion while Stanley has sex with a woman he met in their hotel. Sky stages a distraction and drugs Lion with aXanaxto steal the car keys before escaping. She accidentally crashes the SUV and tries to run before Stanley catches up to her. Locking Sky in their hotel room, he calls Pepper and demands answers only to find out that Sky is an underage prostitute who must be delivered to Yates, a pimp who Stanley has had dealings with in the past.
Sky pleads with Stanley and Lion not to take her to Reno, but Stanley retorts by saying that Pepper will kill them if they don't. The trio take the SUV to a local garage, but they do not have enough money to pay for the repairs. While searching through Sky's wallet, Stanley finds out her real name is Mary McGinty and that her estranged, strictly religious family lives inGary, Indiana. The trio take a taxi to meet them while posing as churchgoers in an effort to get more money from them. After insulting and demeaning her daughter for the "sinful" path she's taken, Sky's mother, Pam, angrily forces them to leave.
The trio squat in an abandoned school for the night, where Sky and Lion further bond, and Lion reveals the brothers' dream to open adry cleaners. Sky questions his relationship with Stanley, observing that he treats Lion like a servant, not a brother, routinely putting him in harm's way, which Lion objects to. In the morning, the pair make their way back to the garage and make a deal with the mechanics to let them have the car if Lion beats two of them simultaneously in a street fight. A reluctant Lion agrees and handily beats the two. The trio drive across the country, stopping off to get lunch at a restaurant where Lion accuses Stanley of using him for his own benefit. A furious Stanley reminds Lion of all the sacrifices that he has made in order to help his brother, but he retorts by revealing hisarthritisand difficulty moving his hands along with remembering events due to all the fighting he has done. Their outburst gets them kicked out of the restaurant when Ash begins to bark incessantly and Stanley gets punched by an irate customer and having the SUV towed.
With no money and no transport, Stanley sells Ash to a father and son from the restaurant without telling Lion, who attacks him. The three board a bus bound for Reno, but Lion and Sky get off atCarson City, Nevada, leaving a sleeping Stanley who wakes up in Reno. He is then kidnapped by Yates' men for not delivering Sky. At a bar, Lion implores Sky to run away with him, having fallen for her. Sky refuses and they have sex in the bathroom, where Lion realizes that Sky is pregnant with Yates' baby. Sky departs, leaving Stanley's gun and some money with him, which he uses to go to Reno. Finding Yates' hideout, who has been torturing Stanley, Lion incapacitates his henchman. As Yates gloats over prostituting Sky, Lion executes him. A freed Stanley says that the pair can run away together and not have to go to San Francisco, but Lion is determined to fight at Jungleland.
A reluctant Stanley goes with him and before the fight, he breaks down in tears, apologizing for all the hurt he has dealt on Lion. Lion forgives Stanley and shows him a ring robe made by Sky as a parting gift, which Stanley is impressed by. The pair walk out to the ring, and Lion fights well, but is distracted and knocked down. A regretful Stanley pleads with Lion not to get up, saying that they can do something else with their lives, but Lion gets up regardless and wins the fight in spectacular fashion. However, the police raid thevenueand Stanley decides to turn himself in to give Lion a chance to get the money. Whilst Lion revels in his victory and Stanley is led away, Sky shows up at the venue as the two reunite.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
