Lily and Paul invite their three-generation family to their rural lakeside home over a weekend. Anna and her partner Chris arrive late, and it soon becomes apparent that she is estranged.
Trying to connect with her sister, Jennifer helps Anna in her room, asking her why she hasn't responded to various family events. Chris has to be introduced around as everyone doesn't know her. Jennifer asks Anna about dancing, which she has quit, she then lists all the other pursuits she's quit like acupuncture, quilting and yoga which their parents have paid for. Anna also is critical of Jennifer's husband Michael, and likewise Jennifer disapproves of Anna bringing her on and off again Chris and of Lily's long-time friend Liz's presence.
Everyone is there to say goodbye to Lily, who suffers from an incurable disease, and with the help of her husband Paul has chosen to pursue euthanasia when the weekend is over. In the meantime, they do crossword puzzles, play charades, etc.
The next morning, the grandson Jon asks his grandfather how they will euthanise Lily. As euthanasia is illegal in the state, although in reality Paul is going to give her the lethal dose, he's going to tell them on the911emergency phone line that she must have taken it while he was on a walk. Although Jon sees her as still okay, Paul explains that Lily is very likely go downhill fast, so she must do it while her arm still works.
At breakfast, although it is summer, Lily suggests they do an early Christmas, assigning different people tasks. First, they all go for a walk, and she shows them where Jennifer was conceived, hence why she and Paul ended up buying the land and building the house there. When Anna asks, her conception story is ordinary.
As her end approaches, their mother's decision becomes more and more difficult to handle for her daughters Jennifer and Anna. Anna tells Chris she is going to call 911 to prevent the procedure, who isn't too supportive of this. In the kitchen, as they're preparing the meal, Jen finds thepentobarbital.
As Jon hangs the ornaments for Lily, he asks for life advice, which she attests elders are no wiser. When she presses for him to tell her his hidden desire, he admits he'd like to become an actor.
Over dinner, Lily gives each of them a piece of jewelry important to her, as well as a novelty tie for Michael and a dildo for Jen. Jon's parents show how controlling they are of him, disapproving when he says he wants to be an actor, he is offered wine and Lily pulls out pot.
When Lily proudly talks about each of them, after she declares she raised two strong, independent women, Anna declares they're both messed up and that she herself had been institutionalised for attempted suicide. Lily is suddenly very tired, and goes to bed.
Chris pulls Jen aside, explaining Anna's suicide attempt and that she is bipolar. When she tells her Anna plans to call 911 to thwart the euthanasia, Jen confronts her sister and talks her out of it. However, downstairs Jen sees Paul and Liz embracing. She stays up all night, scouring over photo albums and realises Liz has been with them on all family trips.
In the morning, although Lily wants them to have a lazy Sunday, Jen gets Anna to back her in announcing they will block the euthanasia by calling 911. Trying to get Paul or Liz to confess, Lily tells everyone it was her idea, as she doesn't want either to be lonely.
Lily gets everyone on board with the procedure, but Jen and Anna insist on being with Paul at her side while she drinks the medication. Afterwards they drive off, one by one.

The company producesaction films, most of which are filmed primarily inSouth AfricaandBulgaria(by 2005, it acquiredNu Boyana Film Studios),[4]among other locations.
In the mid-1980s,The Cannon Group, Inc.began expanding its operation into Africa, taking advantage of cheap locations and labor in countries such asZimbabweandSouth Africa.Avi Lerneropened Nu Metro Entertainment, a film production company based inJohannesburgto accommodate production demands in the countries.[5]During this time, Lerner executive produced many films, such asAmerican Ninja 2: The ConfrontationandRiver of Deathfor Cannon as well asHowling IV: The Original NightmareforHarry Alan Towers.
After pressure from anti-apartheid forces, Cannon closed its African operations in 1988,[6]Lerner created a new company, Nu Image, to produce original, low budget films alongside his brother Danny Lerner and otherCannonemployees Trevor Short, Danny Dimbort andBoaz Davidson.[5]
From 1992, Nu Image began producing multiple films a year, mainly in the action genre. Many of its films wentdirect-to-video, however some, such asShark Attackdebuted ontelevision. Many stars, writers and directors fromThe Cannon Group, Inc.appeared in films for Nu Image, includingDavid Bradley,Michael Dudikoff,Sam FirstenbergandBilly Drago. They also built a new generation of action talent such asBryan Genesse[7]andJoe Lara.[8]
However, their efforts to break into the mainstream withmockbusterssuch asFreefallstarringEric Roberts,Jeff FaheyandPamela Gidley, created to capitalise on the success ofSylvester Stallone'sCliffhangerfailed to make much of an impact.Freefallended up goingdirect-to-video.[9]
After the successes ofcreature featuressuch asAnacondaandDeep Blue Seareleased in the late 1990s, Nu Image produced a spate of low budget franchises to capitalise on the trend including;Tobe Hooper'sCrocodile,Shark Attack,Spiders,Killer Rats,OctopusandRaging Sharksand various sequels were produced from 1999 to 2005. While not critically successful, the films were extremely successful on television and home media.
In 1999, Nu Image formed a subsidiary label, Millennium Films, for higher-budget productions. From the mid-2000s, the main Nu Image company gradually began producing fewer films, with Millennium Films releasing more with a greater level of financing than previously.
In 2005, it purchasedNu Boyana Film Studiosin Bulgaria.[10]
In March 2007, Nu Image acquired a controlling 52% stake in independent film and home video companyFirst Look Studios. As a result, Nu Image and Millennium Films were given an additional outlet for home video and theatrical distribution.[11]
One of the first films to be produced by Millennium Films was the remakeThe Wicker ManstarringNicolas Cage.[12]The film was a critical and commercial failure.[13][14]They continued on with a focus onsequelsandremakesof notable properties such asDay of the Dead[15]andRambo.[16]After the commercial success ofRambo,[17][18]Millennium Films entered into a multi-year deal withLionsgateto produce several big-budgeted films, the first of which wasConan the Barbarian.[19]The deal would be extended over the years with successful box-office hits (The Mechanic[20]) andbox office bombs(The Legend of Hercules[21]). Another notable success wasOlympus Has FallenstarringGerard Butler.[22]
In November 2010, First Look filed for bankruptcy. Nu Image formed Millennium Entertainment, LLC to assume the assets of First Look.[23]
Millennium Entertainment was sold in August 2014. The company's library and distribution assets had been sold to a consortium consisting of its current management and Virgo Investment Group. The new owners renamed the companyAlchemyin January 2015, finally cutting ties to its former sister company Millennium Films, which remained under the control ofAvi Lerner.[24]Alchemy filed forChapter 7 Bankruptcyon June 30, 2016.[25]
In 2017, a deal was reached withThe Recon Group, a Chinese investment firm, for them to purchase a majority stake in the Millennium Films subsidiary.[26]The deal was signed and a $20 million downpayment was secured.[27]However, this deal was later announced to be off in August 2017 due to the Chinese government clamping down on overseas business investments.[28]The same year, Millennium Films was merged into Nu Image to form Millennium Media.
In 2017, Millennium faced sexual harassment allegations alleging hostile workplace and rampant sexual harassment and gender disparity.[29]

Roger Harry Michell was born on 5 June 1956 inPretoria,Union of South Africa.[1][2]He was not South African, as is sometimes mistakenly assumed, but was born there because his father was a British diplomat who had been posted to South Africa. On account of his father's job, Michell spent parts of his childhood inBeirut,Damascus, andPrague; he and his family were in Prague during the1968 invasion.[2]
He was educated atClifton CollegeinBristol, where he began directing and writing short plays, before studying English atQueens' College, Cambridge,[2]where he directed and acted in dozens of plays, winning both the RSC Buzz Goodbody Award for Best Student Director at the NSDF, and a Fringe First Award at theEdinburgh Fringe Festivalfor his playPrivate Dick. He graduated in 1977.[1]
After leaving Cambridge, Michell moved toBrighton[2]where he directedPeter Gill’sSmall Changeand other plays for the Brighton Actors Workshop. In 1978, under the RTDS scheme, he became an assistant director at theRoyal Court Theatrewhere he assisted, amongst others,John Osborne,Max Stafford-Clark, andSamuel Beckett, and directed a number of plays in the Theatre Upstairs.[2]Michell's contemporaries at the Court includedAntonia Bird,Simon Curtis,Hanif Kureishiand, as his stage manager,Danny Boyle.[2]
In 1979 he left the Royal Court Theatre and began writing and directing as a freelance, the most successful result of which wasPrivate Dick, a comedy aboutRaymond Chandlerco-written withRichard Maher, which opened at theLyric Hammersmithto great reviews, and later moved to the West End withRobert PowellasPhilip Marlowe.
In 1985, Michell joined theRoyal Shakespeare Companywhere, as Resident Director for six years, he directed plays by Shakespeare, Havel, Nelson, Bond, Farquhar, Darke, and others, including Richard Nelson'sSome Americans Abroad, which transferred to Broadway in 1990. In 1989, Michell was appointed the Judith E Wilson Senior Fellow atTrinity College, Cambridge.
Michell was a graduate of the BBC Directors' Course, a three-month course especially designed to help theatre directors understand the camera. Subsequently, his first piece of television was the three-part Leigh Jackson thrillerDowntown Lagos, produced byMichael Wearing, which in turn led to the award-winning adaptation ofHanif Kureishi's autobiographical novelThe Buddha of Suburbia, starringNaveen Andrews, which he scripted with the novelist. He followed that with theBBCfilm ofJane Austen’sPersuasionin 1995, widely regarded as one of the finest Austen adaptations, and winner of the 1995BAFTAfor Best Single Drama. Michell then directedMy Night with Reg(1997), from the award-winning play that he had directed at the Royal Court and for a year in the West End. Next cameTitanic Town(1998), a story set in Northern Ireland in the 70s starringJulie WaltersandCiaran Hinds, and winner of Awards at Emden and Locarno.
Throughout the 1990s, Michell directed a number of productions at theNational Theatreincluding Mustapha Matura'sThe Coup, Pinter'sThe Homecoming,Dylan Thomas’sUnder Milk Wood, Joanna Murray Smith'sHonour, Joe Penhall'sLandscape With Weapon, Granville Barker'sWaste, Nina Raine'sConsent(subsequently at theHarold Pinter Theatrein the West End), andBlue/OrangewithBill Nighy,Andrew Lincoln, andChiwetel Ejiofor, which won numerous awards and played in the West End for a year.

He then directed the 2002 critical box office successChanging LanesstarringBen AffleckandSamuel L. Jackson.[3]
For the next decade, Michell chose for personal reasons to work only in the UK, and in 2003 directedThe Mother, his second collaboration with Hanif Kureishi, starringAnne ReidandDaniel Craig. Craig also starred in Michell's subsequent film,Enduring Love(2004), an adaptation ofIan McEwan's novel, before directingPeter O'Toolein 2006'sVenus, again written by Kureishi. Their partnership became one of several important relationships with writers in both theatre and film, includingNick Darke,Joe Penhall,Joanna Murray Smith, andNina Raine.
Michell was in negotiations to work with Craig yet again in 2006 on what became the James Bond filmQuantum of Solace, but after months of unfruitful script conferences, and in spite of good relationships with the producers, he jumped ship. Michell later explained that he reached "tipping point" with producersBarbara BroccoliandMichael G Wilson, who were "desperate" to release the next 007 film in 2007, despite the lack of a script. This "freaked" Michell out, seeing a WGA writers’ strike fast-approaching, production gearing up, and still no proper script or story. The producers eventually delayed the film a year and eventually went ahead withMarc Forsterat the helm.
He continued to work in theatre, atHampstead Theatrewith Richard Nelson'sFarewell to the Theatre; at the Royal Court with Joe Penhall'sBirthday, which he also filmed starringStephen Mangan, and Nina Raine'sTribes; and at theOld Vic, Penhall'sMood Music, starringBen Chaplin.

Next came the multi-award-winningLe Week-End, another collaboration with Hanif Kureishi, starringJim BroadbentandLindsay Duncan, set and filmed in Paris. After working withEllie Gouldingon the mini rom-comHow Long Will I Love You?, Michell directed the much-lauded two-part TV dramaThe Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies, written byPeter Morgan, and telling the true-life story of a retired schoolteacher accused of murder. Jefferies was in fact not only innocent, but one of Michell's teachers at school. The film went on to win Michell a second BAFTA, as well as RTS and other awards.

Wasikowska was born on 25 October 1989[2]inCanberra, Australia.[3]She attended Cook Primary School, Ainslie Primary School andCanberra High School,[4]andKarabar High SchoolinQueanbeyan, which neighbours Canberra.[5]She has an older sister, Jess, and a younger brother, Kai.[6][7]Her mother, Marzena Wasikowska, is a Polish photographer, while her father, John Reid, is an Australian photographer andcollagist.[8][9][10]In 1998, when she was eight years old, Wasikowska and her family moved toSzczecin,Polandfor a year, after her mother received a grant to produce a collection of work based on her own experience of emigrating from Poland to Australia in 1974 at the age of 11.[11][12]Wasikowska and her siblings took part in the production as subjects; she explained toJohanna SchnellerofThe Globe and Mailin July 2010, "We never had to smile or perform. We weren't always conscious of being photographed. We'd just do our thing, and she'd take pictures of us."[13]
At the age of nine, Wasikowska began studying ballet with Jackie Hallahan at the Canberra Dance Development Centre,[14]with hopes of going professional. She began dancingen pointeat thirteen, and was training 35 hours a week in addition to attending school full-time.[15][16]Her daily routine consisted of leaving school in the early afternoon and dancing until nine o'clock at night.[17]A spur on her heel hampered her dancing.[18]Her passion forballetalso waned due to the increasing pressure to achieve physical perfection and her growing dissatisfaction with that world in general, and she quit at the age of fourteen. However, she credits ballet with improving her ability to handle her nerves in auditions.[18]
At the same time, she had been exposed to European and Australian cinema at an early age, and was particularly moved byKrzysztof Kieślowski'sThree ColourstrilogyandGillian Armstrong'sMy Brilliant Career.[13]Although shy and averse to performing during her school years,[13][19]she was inspired to try to break into acting after seeingHolly HunterinThe PianoandGena RowlandsinA Woman Under the Influence.[20]She felt acting in film was a way to explore human imperfections.[21]She looked up twelve Australian talent agencies on the Internet and contacted them all, but received only one response. Despite her lack of acting experience, she arranged a meeting after persistent callbacks.[20]
Wasikowska landed her first acting role in 2004 with a two-episode stint on the Australiansoap operaAll Saints. She had just turned 15 when she was cast in her Australian film debut,Suburban Mayhem(2006),[18][22]for which she was nominated for a Young Actor'sAFIAward.[5]That year she also appeared in her first short film,Lens Love Story, in which she had no dialogue.
In 2007, Wasikowska appeared in the crocodile horror filmRogue,alongsideRadha MitchellandSam Worthington. She observed quietly on the set; fellow actorStephen Currynoted, "We didn't hear a peep out of her for three weeks, which earned her the nickname of 'Rowdy'".[22]She beat nearly 200 other actresses for a part in the dramaSeptember(2007) when she was cast on the spot by director Peter Carstairs following her audition.[18]She starred inSpencer Susser's acclaimed short filmI Love Sarah Jane,which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.[23][24]
At the age of seventeen, Wasikowska received her first big break role in the United States when she was cast as Sophie, a suicidal gymnast, in HBO's acclaimed weekly dramaIn Treatment; she auditioned for the role by videotape.[25][26]The part required her to leave school in Canberra and move to Los Angeles for three months, while enrolling incorrespondence courses.[26]She earned critical acclaim for her performance as the troubled teenager treated by psychotherapist Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne),[27][28][29]which included praise for her American accent.[30]She revealed in an October 2008 interview withVarietythat she was something of a mimic as a child, and that the widely available American films and TV shows in Australia made it easier for Australians to learn to speak like Americans.[31]
This show enabled Wasikowska to gain roles in American films. She played Chaya, the young wife ofAsael Bielski(Jamie Bell) inDefiance(2008).[32]DirectorEdward Zwickcast her, explaining to the Australian edition ofVogue, "Her inner life is so vivid that it comes across even when she's being still."[33]Her next role was as aviation pioneerElinor SmithinMira Nair's 2009 biopicAmelia.[34]In June 2008, for her work onIn Treatment, she received an Australians in Film Breakthrough Award.[35]
Wasikowska played the supporting role of Pamela Choat in the 2009Southern Gothicindependent filmThat Evening SunoppositeHal Holbrook. DirectorScott Teems, seeking a young actress who bore a resemblance toSissy Spacek, initially balked at the casting director's suggestion of Wasikowska for the role. He wanted to cast all nativeSouthernersfor the sake of authenticity.[36][37]However, after auditions with other actresses were unsuccessful, Teems relented and summoned Wasikowska for as audition. During the two hours she had to prepare, she watchedCoal Miner's Daughteronline to quickly learn a Southern accent, and impressed Teems enough to be the only non-American actor in the film.[37]She was nominated for a 2009Independent Spirit Awardfor Best Supporting Female,[38]and the film received a South by Southwest award for Best Ensemble Cast.
In July 2008, Wasikowska was cast as the eponymous heroine inTim Burton's version ofAlice in Wonderland, alongsideJohnny Depp,Anne HathawayandHelena Bonham Carter.[39]She sent a videotaped audition to casting directors in London, and her first live reading in Los Angeles occurred on the same day as herEvening Sunaudition.[36]After three more auditions in London, she was given the role.[40]Burton cited her "old-soul quality" as a catalyst in casting her: "Because you're witnessing this whole thing through her eyes, it needed somebody who can subtly portray that."[26]
Wasikowska portrayed a nineteen-year-old Alice returning to Wonderland for the first time in over a decade after falling down a rabbit hole from an unwanted marriage proposal. Her affinity for the character played a part in her desire for the role, as she had read theLewis Carrollbooks as a child and was a fan ofJan Švankmajer's 1988 stop-motion filmAlice.[41]She considered Burton's film as a chance to explore a deeper characterisation of Alice, to whom she felt young women her age could relate, saying: "Alice has a certain discomfort within herself, within society and among her peers; I [...] have definitely felt similarly about all of those things, so I could really understand her not fitting in. Alice also [is] an observer who is thinking a lot, and that's similar to how I am."[40]
ForLisa Cholodenko's indie comedyThe Kids Are All Right, Wasikowska was cast as Joni, the bookish daughter of a lesbian couple (Annette BeningandJulianne Moore) who was conceived viaartificial insemination. At her younger brother's (Josh Hutcherson) request, she seeks out theirbiological father(Mark Ruffalo).[42]During shooting, she successfully campaigned to have Joni wearpajamasin several home scenes.[43]She explained toOrlando Sentinelfilm critic Roger Moore, "[Joni's] very comfortable in her place, with who she is. So I pushed to have her, whenever she was at home, in her pajamas. That's comfortable! And that's something I do."[44]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
