Amy is a young woman who has recently purchased a house, and is congratulated over the phone by her friend Jane. Amy seems distant, confusing Jane, who mentions that she cannot come over due to having to stop by her sister-in-law's birthday party, but agrees to visit anyway. Amy searches for urns on her computer, before changing her search to leather jackets. When Jane visits, Amy reveals to her that she knows she is going to die the next day, which Jane initially writes off as a result of Amy consuming alcohol, revealing that Amy is a former alcoholic. Amy repeatedly says that she wants to be turned into a leather jacket after she dies, so she could be made into something of use. Jane leaves, telling her she will call the next day. Jane returns to her house to continue studying samples under a microscope, but suddenly becomes paranoid and rushes to Amy's house, leaving several voice messages but being unable to contact her. She then leaves to go to her sister-in-law's birthday party.
At the party, Jane appears disheveled and in her pajamas, confusing the other guests and disturbing them by saying she, too, is going to die tomorrow. This upsets Susan, Jane's sister-in-law, while Jane's brother, Jason, tries to defuse the tension. Tilly, a party guest, remarks to her boyfriend, Brian, that she thought Jane was crazy as they are in the car preparing to leave. However, Brian says he thought she was correct, revealing that the fear of dying Amy and Jane has is contagious, and both of them are now infected. Jason and Susan are then infected while cleaning after the party, as they end up passing the fear onto their daughter. At a hospital, Brian kills his father by interrupting his life support systems, upon which Tilly reveals she was simply waiting for the death in order to break up with him. Jane goes to a doctor, who initially wants to refer her to a psychologist.
Amy goes for a ride in a dune buggy with a driver, during which she recalls a time that she and her boyfriend Craig went to Craig's brother's vacation house for a weekend. During the weekend, the two order pizza, and it is implied that Craig became infected by the pizza delivery driver. After the ride, Amy passes the fear onto the dune buggy driver, before the two briefly attempt to make out, before giving up. Back at the doctor's office, Jane passes the fear onto the doctor, who has a breakdown before leaving to be with his wife. Jane returns home and begins communicating with the bacteria she sees under the microscope in an attempt to calm herself, before seeing something enter her home that she asks "is this how it ends?"
Amy returns to the vacation home to find that Craig has died by suicide. The next morning, Jason and Susan discuss what they believe will be their final day, and agree to not wake their daughter so she can pass away in her sleep. Jane then wanders into the home of two young women, Sky and Erin, who seem unfazed by Jane's bloodied appearance, before revealing they both have the sickness as well. Jane asks to use the pool, and begins swimming as her blood soaks the water. Sky and Erin talk casually about what they will miss when they are dead. Amy then visits a leather shop, and begins asking questions about custom work, eventually asking about what they could do with "a mammal". Amy begins tearing up as the employee describes the process, before jolting awake, finding herself lying on some rocks. She begins whispering to herself, going between "it's okay" and "I'm not okay", and gently humming.

NEON Rated, LLC,doing business asNeon(stylized inall caps), is an Americanindependent filmproductionanddistributioncompany founded in 2017 by CEO Tom Quinn andTim League, who also was the co-founder of theAlamo Drafthouse Cinemachain.[1]As of 2019, League is no longer involved with daily operations for the company.[6]
Its first film,Colossal, was released in 2017.[7]The company became known for distributing such notable films asI, Tonya(2017),Parasite(2019),Portrait of a Lady on Fire(2019),Palm Springs(2020),Flee(2021),Spencer(2021),The Worst Person in the World(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023),Anora(2024),Longlegs(2024),The Seed of the Sacred Fig(2024), andThe Monkey(2025).[8][9]
Parasitewent on to become Neon's highest-grossing film at the worldwidebox officewith $262 million and the first non-English-language film to win theAcademy Award for Best Picture.[10]In 2024,Longlegshad a domestic box office gross of $58.6 million, becoming the distributor's highest-grossing film ever in North America.[11]Anorabecame the company's second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[12]Neon has also worked with several high-profile filmmakers, which includesSean Baker,[13]Bong Joon Ho,Julia Ducournau,Craig Gillespie,Pablo Larraín, andCéline Sciamma.[14]
During the 4th Annual Zurich Summit, Tom Quinn commented on Neon's intent to release titles that appeal to audiences who "skew under 45, that have no aversion to violence, no aversion to foreign language and to non-fiction".[15]Explaining the success of the company in 2024, Quinn stated: "We were very much a startup, with everyone functioning as this sophisticated amoeba. We very quickly found ourselves that year inTorontowith a great slate [...] That work enabled us to sit at the table in Toronto that year and buyI, Tonya. Before the ink was even dry on the deal, we were planning itsOscar campaign. It's a testament to how quickly we can make decisions because we're not this big studio. We've always used that to our advantage."[16]
In September 2017, the company partnered withBlumhouse Productionsto manage BH Tilt.[17]In 2018, a majority stake of Neon was sold to30West, the media venture arm of "The Friedkin Group".[4][18]In February 2021,Bleecker Streetpartnered with Neon to launch the joint home entertainment distribution companyDecal, which is a standalone full-service operation that handlesdistribution dealson the home entertainment rights to both Neon and Bleecker Street's features. The first film to be distributed through Decal was the Bleecker Street releaseSupernovain winter 2021.[5]Additionally, Decal acquired North American distribution rights to the South Africanhorror filmGaiafor a summertheatrical release, marking their first ever acquisition.[19]
Andrew Brown (Co-President of Decal) oversaw the launch of Neon's home entertainment division. In 2022, Brown was promoted to "President of Digital Distribution". The exec, who has served as "SVP of Digital Strategy, Marketing, and Distribution" for Neon since 2017, also manages Neon's library, and oversees the annualFYC DVD Box Setanddirect-to-consumerdigital portal "Neon Cinema".[20]Prior to the joint-venture,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, as well asThe Criterion CollectionandWell Go USA Entertainment(for the filmPossessorwhich Neon and Well Go co-distributed), distributed several Neon films onhome video.[21][22][23]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, Neon was approved to continue promotional activities for its films since the company does not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP) nor had encountered any issue in receivingSAG-AFTRAinterim agreements.[24][25][26]
In August 2023, Neon hired formerA24employees Alexandra Altschuler as "VP Media" and Don Wilcox as "VP Marketing".[27]That same month, Neon hired former Sierra/Affinity employee Kristen Figeroid as "President of International Sales and Distribution", Laurel Charnetsky as "VP International Acquisitions & Operations", and Dan Stadnicki as "Manager, International Sales & Distribution".[28]In May 2024, Neon hired Joey Monteiro as "EVP, International Marketing" and Ashley Hirsch as "Manager of International Sales and Marketing".[29]That same month, Neon promoted Elissa Federoff from "President of Distribution" to "Chief Distribution Officer" and Ryan Friscia from "EVP, Finance and Business Development" to "Chief Financial Officer".[30]Furthermore, Jeff Deutchman, who joined Neon when it was launched, serves as "President of Acquisitions and Production".[31]
Additionally, Neon has acquired the distribution rights to fivePalme d'Orwinners at theCannes Film Festival:Parasite(2019),Titane(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023), andAnora(2024); all five won consecutively.[31][32][33]The company's strategy to acquire such titles at Cannes is to eschew "the lazy approach", said Deutchman. "The only real way to do Cannes is to go see as many movies as you can, because you never know where the nextDogtoothorBorderorHungerorForce Majeureis going to come from", he added, citing several modern Cannes standouts championed by arthouse buyers.[31]After acquiringParasitein 2018, Neon financed and distributed the film the following year in U.S. territories.[34]"From the very beginning, Tom Quinn sawParasiteas a universal film and refused to put it in a box as a foreign-language or international film", saidParasitedirectorBong Joon Ho. "He saw the heart of the film and understood that it was about all of us living in our modern class-based society. I was always grateful for that."[16]Neon spent $20 million promoting, distributing, and campaigning for the film's awards.[3]The film subsequently became Neon's highest-grossing film with more than $200 million at the worldwidebox officeand won fourAcademy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Director. Similarly, Neon spent $18 million promotingAnora, three times the film's original budget.[3]Anoraultimately won the two aforementioned Academy Awards whileAnatomy of a FallandTriangle of Sadnesswere nominated for the same two categories, among others. As of March 2025, Neon has garnered 39 Academy Award nominations, winning 11 overall.[10][12][35]
In 2023, Quinn commented on the company's success at Cannes, saying: "We've seen over the years that each of these films, because of their credibility and success, the Palme d'Or has come to mean something quite impactful for a very young group ofcinephiles. And the reason why we know this is we've tested all these movies and dating back toParasite, probably I think, the fifth reason why people came to see the film, in itstest screeninginSherman Oaks, was the fact that it won the Palme d'Or, and each subsequent year that went up. And this year, the number one reason why people came to see the film [Anatomy of a Fall], at a test screening inBurbank, was the fact that it had won the Palme d'Or."[36]In 2024, Quinn stated: "The award means a lot. To audiences here who are looking for the absolute most adventurous, forward-looking cinema available, that award represents it because these films have delivered, and they've been major Oscar contenders."[16]
In July 2024, Neon received its biggest opening weekend at the box office with the horror thriller filmLonglegs, after scoring $22.6 million from 2,510 theaters (a figure that includes $2.5–3 million in Thursday previews) and only behindUniversal/Illumination's second weekend ofDespicable Me 4. Initially projected to gross $7–9 million, the opening marked the biggest total for an original horror film of 2024, one of the top 20 weekends for an independent film and the best opening ever for an independent horror film.[37][38][39]To promote the film, Neon utilizedguerrilla marketingtactics similar to those that led to the box office success ofThe Blair Witch Project(1999).[40]DirectorOz Perkinscredited Neon for the film's marketing, stating the studio "really responded strongly to the movie, the raw materials of the movie really excited them, the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it sounds. They asked me early on, 'Do we have your permission to kind of go nuts?' And I said, 'What else are we doing here? Go for it. Do your thing.'"[41]The film's total marketing budget was under $10 million, focusing ondigital contentand not havingtelevision ads.[37]During its third weekend,Longlegsbecame the company's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office, earning $58.6 million, surpassing whatParasiteearned with $53.3 million in 2020.[11]Furthermore, it became the top grossing R-rated horror film of 2024 and the highest-grossing indie horror film of the last decade, topping A24'sTalk to Me(2022),Insidious: Chapter 3(2015) fromFocus Features, and A24'sHereditary(2018).[11]Afterward, furthering their marketing campaign, from August 1 to 4, Neon (partnering withAtom Tickets) offered free tickets to anyone who has a birthday that falls on the 14th of any given month. To get the tickets, those who registered and purchased tickets through Atom Tickets received a special promo code after verifying their date of birth and were able to get one free ticket per customer, while supplies lasted.[42]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
