David Copperfieldis born to his widowed mother, Clara, and begins saving noteworthy quotes from his life on scraps of paper. As a child, he visits his nannyPeggotty's family in their upturned boathouse inYarmouth. When David returns home, he discovers Clara has marriedEdward Murdstone, a strict and callous factory owner. After beingbeatenby Murdstone and bullied by Murdstone's sister Jane, David is sent to work in Murdstone's bottling factory in London, where he lodges with the Micawber family, who are always cheerful but frequently pursued by their creditors.
As a young man, David still works at the factory, while the Micawbers are evicted by bailiffs and sent todebtors' prison. Informed of his mother's death only after her funeral, David wreaks havoc in the factory and departs forDoverto find his wealthy auntBetsey Trotwood, his only living relative. Her lodger, the eccentricMr. Dick, believes himself to be burdened with the lateKing Charles I’sthoughts and, like David, jots them down. David attaches these notes to a kite for Mr. Dick to fly, which helps clear his mind. David meets Betsey's accountant, Mr. Wickfield, and Wickfield's daughter,Agnes.
Admitted to a school for boys, David is befriended by his classmate,James Steerforth, who calls him Daisy and believes him to be a gentleman. Later, a butcher's lad mocks the two friends and David challenges him to a fight - David gets knocked out. Agnes tends to his wounds but David disappoints her by saying he thinks of her as a sister.Mr. Micawberbriefly joins the school as a teacher, but is exposed by Steerforth as a former convict and fired. Mr. Wickfield's clerkUriah Heep, who has previously been mocked by the boys, tries to blackmail David with knowledge of his past. At a farewell party at school, David meets Steerforth's mother, ignores his future employer, and falls in love with a somewhat ditsy girl namedDora Spenlow. He is hired as a trainee lawyer with Dora's father's firm in London, where he lives the life of a "young gentleman" and courts Dora.
Betsey arrives in London with Mr. Dick, having lost her fortune and home, and David is forced to decamp with them to a slum dwelling offered by Uriah, who has been keeping Mr. Wickfield drunk and persuaded him to make him a partner. Uriah is also courting Agnes. David visits Pegotty's family in their boat-house with Steerforth, who runs away with Pegotty's adopted daughter Emily, leaving her longtime fiancé Ham. Mr. Micawber now lives on the streets with his family and has pawned his belovedconcertina, which he asks Mr. Dick to buy back. Instead, Mr. Dick steals it for him, and David invites the Micawbers to move in with him, Betsey, and Mr. Dick.
David begins to write the story of his life as a book, using the fragments he has saved since childhood. Agnes asks David, Micawber, Betsey, and Mr. Dick for a letter written by Mr. Wickfield as evidence of Uriah’s misdeeds. They confront Uriah, who has been embezzling funds — including Betsey’s missing fortune — by forging Mr. Wickfield's signature, presenting the letter as proof. David punches Uriah after the villainous clerk strikes Betsey, and dismisses him. Recognising that she no longer fits in David's "story", Dora calls off their engagement, asking him to write her out of his book.
Emily is spotted in London and confronted by Steerforth’s mother, but rescued by David and Pegotty’s family. She reveals that Steerforth abandoned her in France, but he will return the following day to Yarmouth. When a storm wrecks Steerforth’s boat off the Yarmouth beach, Ham swims out on a line, but Steerforth refuses to be rescued and is drowned. Mourning his feckless friend’s death, David realises he is in love with Agnes, who reciprocates. He publishes his book to great success, performingpublic readingsof his story. His new career as a writer allows him to buy back Betsey’s home for her and Mr. Dick and continue to support the Micawbers, and he and Agnes marry and have a daughter.

An agreement soon concluded with the Cinema Exhibitors Association allowed a brief period of cinema exhibition if the budget of the films was below £1.25 million.[3]Channel Four Films struck several deals with other film production companies including theBFI Production Board,Goldcrest FilmsandMerchant Ivory.[3]By 1984, Channel Four Films were investing in a third of the feature films made in the UK.[4]

Rose and Channel Four Films are credited by many as being a significant figure in the regeneration of British cinema and particularly remembered for films such asWish You Were Here,Dance With a Stranger,Mona Lisa, andLetter to Brezhnev. Channel Four Films also invested in earlyWorking Title Filmsas well as most of the films of Frears,Ken LoachandMike Leigh.[2]Leigh told writerHannah Rothschildaround 2008 that Film on Four had saved the British film industry: "This is a non-negotiable, historical fact of life and anybody who suggests that this isn't the case is simply either suffering from some kind of ignorance or has got some terrible chip."[1]
Rose remained in his post as Commissioning Editor until March 1990.[6]During his tenure at Channel 4, Rose approved the making of 136 films, half of which received cinema screenings.[11]Of the films Rose backed, 20 were from overseas sources, including work by directorsTheo Angelopoulos,Andrei TarkovskyandWim Wenders.[12]The company also helped British minority filmmakers includingPo-Chih Leong(Ping Pong(1986));Horace Ové(Playing Away(1986)) andHanif Kureishi(My Beautiful Laundrette;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid(1987)).

In the 1990s, Channel Four partnered withThe Samuel Goldwyn Companyto create a distribution company to release Channel Four films and Goldwyn films in the UK but Goldwyn pulled out late on and in August 1995,Film Four Distributorswas formed.[14]Its first release wasBlue Juice(1995) and its first major successes wereSecrets & LiesandBrassed Offin 1996.[15][16][2]

Laurie was born on 11 June 1959, in theBlackbird Leysarea ofOxford,[6][7]the youngest of four children of Patricia (née Laidlaw) andWilliam George Ranald Mundell "Ran" Laurie, who was a physician and winner of an Olympic gold medal in thecoxless pairs(rowing) at the1948 London Games.[7][8]He has an older brother, Charles Alexander Lyon Mundell Laurie,[7]and two older sisters, Susan and Janet.[9][10]He had a strained relationship with his mother,[7][11]whom he noted as "Presbyterianby character, by mood".[7]He later said, "I was frustration to her. She didn't like me."[7]His mother died frommotor neurone diseasein 1989, at the age of 73. According to Laurie, she endured the disease for two years and suffered "painful, plodding paralysis" while being cared for by Laurie's father, whom he has called "the sweetest man in the whole world".[10]
Laurie's parents, who were both of Scottish descent, attendedSt Columba's Presbyterian Church(nowUnited Reformed Church)[12]in Oxford.[13][14]He notes that "belief in God didn't play a large role" in his home, but "a certain attitude to life and the living of it did".[7]He followed this by stating, "Pleasure was something that was treated with great suspicion, pleasure was something that... I was going to say it had to be earned but even the earning of it didn't really work. It was something to this day, I mean, I carry that with me. I find pleasure a difficult thing; I don't know what you do with it, I don't know where to put it."[7]He later stated, "I don't believe in God, but I have this idea that if there were a God, or destiny of some kind looking down on us, that if he saw you taking anything for granted, he'd take it away."[15]
Laurie was brought up in Oxford and attended theDragon Schoolfrom seven to 13, later stating, "I was, in truth, a horrible child. Not much given to things of a 'bookey' nature, I spent a large part of my youth smokingNumber Sixand cheating in French vocabulary tests."[16]He went on toEton College, which he described as "the most private of private schools".[7]He arrived atSelwyn College, Cambridge, in 1978,[17]which he says he attended "as a result of family tradition" since his father went there.[7]Laurie notes that his father was a successful rower at Cambridge and that he was "trying to follow in [his] father's footsteps".[7]He studiedarchaeologyandanthropology, specialising insocial anthropology,[18]and graduated withthird-class honoursin 1981.[19]
Like his father, Laurie rowed at school and university.[7]In 1977, he was a member of the junior coxed pair that won the British national title before representing Britain's Youth Team at the 1977 Junior World Rowing Championships.

There he metEmma Thompson, with whom he had a romantic relationship; the two remain good friends.[7]She introduced him to his future comedy partner,Stephen Fry.

The revue was written principally by Laurie and Fry, and the cast also included Thompson,Tony Slattery,Paul ShearerandPenny Dwyer.

At school I didn't say a word for the first four weeks – I called it my Silent Month. I think it was because everyone was speaking so differently from how it had been in Wales. Then, after four weeks, I came home one day and said, 'Muumm, I wanna go to Sarfend!' For her that was the end because I had lost my lovely Welsh lilt. So I became very conscious of speech and the effects it can have. But when I went back to Wales I would start talking all Welsh, 'like that, you see' before going allAlf Garnettwhile coming back the other way.[2]

The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
