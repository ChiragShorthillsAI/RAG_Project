It is a modern adaptation of the 1898 ghost storyThe Turn of the ScrewbyHenry James.[4]It starsMackenzie Davis,Finn Wolfhard,Brooklynn Prince, andJoely Richardson, and follows a young governess in 1994 who is hired to watch over two children after their parents are killed.
It entered development in March 2016, described as a passion project forSteven Spielberg, who wanted to be involved in a horror film again. The adaptation went through two phases of production: first asHauntedwithJuan Carlos Fresnadilloattached as director, then asThe Turningwith Sigismondi. Filming took place atKillruddery House, County Wicklow, Ireland from February through April 2018.[5]
The Turningpremiered atLos Angeles Film Festivalon January 23, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States on January 24, 2020, byUniversal Pictures. The film received largely negative reviews from critics and was abox office disappointment, grossing only $19.4 million worldwide against a $14 million budget.[6]
Miss Jessel, the live-in tutor at the Fairchild Estate, flees the house in a panic and is attacked by a ragged man.
Sometime later, in 1994, Kate Mandell becomes a governess for seven-year-old Flora Fairchild after Miss Jessel's disappearance. Before leaving, she visits her mother, Darla, who lives in a mental institution because she suffers from delusions. At the Fairchild Estate, Kate is informed by the caretaker Mrs. Grose that Flora witnessed her parents die in a car accident and is a "special case". Flora confesses to Kate that she is afraid Kate will leave her like Miss Jessel did but Kate promises not to.
That night, Kate encounters Flora's brother Miles, who is back from boarding school. The next day, she receives a call from the school's principal, who informs her that Miles is expelled after having been found strangling another boy. Kate becomes more aggravated with Miles and lashes out at him when he and Flora begin pulling pranks on her. Miles suggests he teach her how to ride horses to make it up to her, as their former riding instructor Quint has recently died.
Kate notices strange occurrences happening at night, so she begins to keep her lights on when she goes to sleep. One day she suggests they go into town, to the dismay of both Flora and Mrs. Grose. Flora throws a fit and runs out of the car after Kate refuses to stop it. Miles warns her to leave but Kate decides to stay due to her promise to Flora. After reconciling, the group plays tag in the house. While looking for Miles, Kate is attacked by the ghost of Miss Jessel. She finds Miss Jessel's journal, which contains frightening entries about how Quint was obsessed with her and took pictures of her while she slept. Mrs. Grose tells her that Quint died a couple weeks following Miss Jessel's departure when he fell from his horse while riding drunk. Kate continues to see Quint and Miss Jessel's ghosts around the house, making her paranoid.
She receives art from her mother in the mail, and Mrs. Grose comments that she hopes Kate's mother's condition isn't genetic. Kate discovers Miss Jessel's dead body in a pond on the house's grounds. She also has a vision of Quint raping and strangling Miss Jessel and tells Mrs. Grose, who appears to have already known about it. Mrs. Grose assures her that she made sure Quint died. Quint's ghost pushes Mrs. Grose over the stair banister, killing her. Kate and the children flee the house, managing to escape in her car.
This previous sequence is revealed to have been Kate's vision as she heard Mrs. Grose's words and looked at her mother's art. She walks in on the children talking about her and becomes convinced that she sees Quint's ghost in the mirror, insisting that Flora saw him too, despite her protests. When Kate accidentally breaks Flora's doll, Miles calls her delusional. They then walk out of the room. In Kate's imagination, she walks into her mother's institution and approaches a figure; as the figure turns around, Kate screams. The face of the figure is not revealed, and it is left open to interpretation as to whether Kate has seen her mother or is in fact seeing a reflection of herself.
The film first entered development in March 2016 and was described as a passion project forSteven Spielberg, as he wanted to be involved in a horror film again.[8]The film adaptation went through two phases of production: first asHauntedwithJuan Carlos Fresnadilloattached as director, then the ultimate version, renamed asThe Turning, withFloria Sigismondi.[9][10]
On March 9, 2016,Deadline Hollywoodreported thatAmblin Entertainmentwas hiring Juan Carlos Fresnadillo to direct a film titledHaunted, which would be inspired byHenry James' 1898gothicghost story,The Turn of the Screw. It would be scripted byChad HayesandCarey W. Hayes, withRoy LeeofVertigo Entertainment, John Middleton and Scott Bernstein as producers.[9]Haunted, which was to shoot under the DreamWorks label, would have been one of the first new projects to move forward since DreamWorks, Amblin andParticipant Mediaformed the newAmblin Partnersin late 2015, and after DreamWorks, which had been distributing its films throughDisney'sTouchstone Picturessince 2008, had struck a new distribution deal withUniversal.[9]
On August 1, 2016, it was announced thatAlfre Woodardhad signed on to the project.[11]Later that month,Rose Lesliejoined as the lead.[12]
On September 21, 2016, five weeks before shooting was set to begin, Spielberg personally pulled the plug on the project[9]becauseScott Z. Burns' partial rewrite caused seismic changes in the story's fabric, altering characters, action, and even the title, and it no longer resembled the project the studio had signed on to make.[9]Spielberg and DreamWorks decided the best course of action was to fire Fresnadillo and Burns, and resume using Hayes' original script, looking to start fresh development with a new director despite $5 million having been spent of the $17 million budget.[9]
On August 24, 2017,Deadlinereported that Amblin Entertainment had set Floria Sigismondi to directHaunted, now renamed asThe Turning,[10]which would feature a new draft byJade Bartlettbased on the original script by Chad and Carey W. Hayes. Production was expected to start in early 2018 with Scott Bernstein and Roy Lee still attached as producers, along with Seth William Meier.[13]In October 2017,Mackenzie Davissigned on to portray the lead role of the nanny.[14]In December 2017, it was announced thatFinn Wolfhardhad been cast as one of the orphans,[15]and in January 2018,Brooklynn Princewas cast as the other.[16]In February 2018, others actors were announced as principal production commenced.[4]The casting of Joely Richardson was announced in January 2019.[7]
Principal production began inIrelandon February 14, 2018,[4]and filming began with the cast and crew behind strict security atKillruddery HouseinCounty Wicklow. Filming for Wolfhard and Prince concluded on March 27, 2018.[17][18]Principal photographyfor the film completed on April 6, 2018.[19]
The film's score is composed byNathan Barr.[20]Lawrence Rothmanand their brother Yves produced the film's original soundtrack,[21][22]which was deemed byThrillistas better than the movie itself.[23]The film's original soundtrack features tracks fromPale Waves,Mitski,girl in red,Kali Uchis,Vagabon,Courtney Love,Warpaint,Alice Glass,The Aubreys,Lawrence RothmanandSoccer Mommy.[24][25]
The Turningwas theatrically released on January 24, 2020, domestically and in select international territories.[7]Universal Pictureshad originally scheduled the film for February 22, 2019.[26]In September 2018, the film was moved back, withDreamWorks Animation'sHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden Worldbeing slated in its place.[27]
The Turninggrossed $15.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $3.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $19.4 million.[3][2]
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongsideThe Gentlemen, and was projected to gross $7–9 million from 3,000 theaters in its opening weekend.[28]The film made $2.5 million on its first day, including $425,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $7.3 million, finishing sixth at the box office.[29]It then fell 56% to $3.1 million in its second weekend, finishing eighth.[30]
Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 12% based on 103 reviews, and an average rating of 3.7/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Stylish but muddled, this misbegotten adaptation of Henry James' classic novel will send horror-hungry viewersTurningto the source material instead."[31]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[32]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film a rare average grade of "F" on an A+ to F scale (one of only 22 films to receive the rating, as of January 2020[update]),[33]whilePostTrakreported an overall positive score of 34% (including an average 0 out of 5 stars), with 20% of people saying they would definitely recommend the film.[29]

DreamWorks Pictures(also known asDreamWorks SKGcommonly referred to asDreamWorks) is an Americanfilm studioanddistributionlabel ofAmblin Partners. It was originally founded on October 12, 1994, as a live-action and animationfilm studiobySteven Spielberg,Jeffrey Katzenberg, andDavid Geffen(which together form the SKG of DreamWorks SKG), of which they owned 72%. The studio formerly distributed its own and third-party films. It has produced or distributed more than ten films with box-office grosses of more than $100 million each.
DreamWorks Pictures was sold toViacom, parent ofParamount Picturesin February 2006 (this version is now named DW Studios). In 2008, DreamWorks announced its intention to end its partnership with Paramount and made a deal to produce films with India'sReliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group,[2]re-creating DreamWorks Pictures as an independent entity. The following year, DreamWorks entered into a distribution agreement withWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, wherein Disney would distribute DreamWorks films through theTouchstone Pictureslabel; the deal continued until August 2016. Since October 2016,Universal Pictureshas distributed most of the films produced by DreamWorks Pictures. Currently, DreamWorks operates out of offices atUniversal Studios Hollywood.
DreamWorks is also distinct from itsformer animation division of the same name, which was spun off in 2004 and became a subsidiary ofNBCUniversalin 2016.[3]Spielberg's company continues to use the original DreamWorks trademarks under license from DreamWorks Animation.[4][5]
The original company was founded followingJeffrey Katzenberg's resignation fromThe Walt Disney Companyin 1994. Katzenberg approachedSteven SpielbergandDavid Geffenabout forming a live-action and animation film studio, which had not been done in decades due to the risk and expense, but all three were very successful. They agreed on three conditions: They would make fewer than nine movies a year, they would be free to work for other studios if they chose, and they would go home in time for dinner. They officially founded DreamWorks SKG on October 12, 1994, with financial backing of $33 million from each of the three partners[6]plus $500 million fromMicrosoftco-founderPaul Allen, and $300 million fromCJ GroupheiressMiky Lee, giving the CJ Group an 11% stake in DreamWorks; the deal was also initially understood to include distribution rights to DreamWorks films across Asia excluding Japan, although CJ ultimately handled rights for only China, South Korea and Hong Kong, with all other international territories handled byUnited International Pictures.[7][8][9]Their new studio was based at offices on theUniversal Studios lot, in the same bungalow asAmblin Entertainment. Despite access tosound stagesandsets, DreamWorks preferred to film motion pictureson location. Usually, however, the company would film in a soundstage or set in amajor studio.
In December 1994,DreamWorks Televisionwas formed after DreamWorks agreed to a $200 million seven-year television production joint venture withCapital Cities/ABC.[10]The company was set up to produce series for broadcast networks, cable channels and first run syndication, with nofirst-lookguarantee forABC, but financial incentives favored the network.[11]Their first show,Champions, was scheduled as a mid-season replacement for ABC. Dan McDermott was named the division's chief executive in June 1995.[12]DreamWorks Television's first success wasSpin Cityon ABC,[11]the parent company of which was bought byThe Walt Disney Companyin February 1996.[13]In 2002, the DreamWorks joint venture agreement with ABC ended. That agreement was replaced by a development agreement withNBC, with a first look clause.[11]In 2013, DreamWorks Television merged withAmblin Television.
In 1995,traditional animationartists fromAmblimationjoined the new studio, which led to DreamWorks buying part ofPacific Data Images, a company specializing in visual effects, and renaming it PDI/DreamWorks in 2000. Both were software divisions and would merge later on. By then, DreamWorks had the traditional animators working for their animation department, and the computer animators worked on CG films.Amblimationwould be shut down in 1997, leading the staff to joinDreamWorks Animation.[citation needed]The same year, DreamWorks Interactive, a computer and video game developer andjoint venturebetween DreamWorks andMicrosoft, was founded. On February 24, 2000,Electronic Artsannounced the acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive and merged it withEA PacificandWestwood Studiosto formEA Los Angeles, laterDanger Close Games.[citation needed]
In June 1995, DreamWorks announced that it had signed a $1 billion deal withMCA Inc.(then parent company ofUniversal Pictures) to distribute its theatrical releases in other countries and its home video releases worldwide over 10 years, while DreamWorks itself would distribute them for the company as a film production label in America.[14][15]MCA also bought a 2% stake in the company for $54 million.[16]
In 1996, the company's record label,DreamWorks Records, was founded, the first project of which wasGeorge Michael's albumOlder. The first band signed to the label waseels, who released their debut albumBeautiful Freakthat year. The record company never lived up to expectations, though, and was sold in October 2003 toUniversal Music Group, which operated the label asDreamWorks Nashville. That label was shut down in 2005 when its flagship artist,Toby Keith, departed to form his own label.[17]
In 1997, DreamWorks Pictures released its first three feature films,The Peacemaker, a film about terrorism;Amistad, Spielberg's first film for the studio about an African slave rebellion and the aftermath of the massacre; andMouse Hunt, the studio's first family film about two brothers trying to fight a mischievous mouse.[citation needed]
In 1998, theUnited States 9th Circuit Court of Appealsupheld a lawsuit against DreamWorks for trademark infringement by Dreamwerks Production Group, Inc.,[18]a company mostly specializing inStar Trekconventions.[19]The same year, DreamWorks Animation produced its first full-length animated features,AntzandThe Prince of Egypt, which were distributed by DreamWorks Pictures. DreamWorks Pictures continued to distribute DreamWorks Animation productions through their distribution name until 2004.
In 2000, DreamWorks was planning on building a studiobacklotafter buying 1,087 acres of land in thePlaya Vistaarea in Los Angeles. It was to be complete with 18sound stages, with many office buildings and a lake. There would also be new homes, schools, churches, and museums. The project was to be completed in 2001, but was cancelled for financial reasons.[20]Starting in 1999, DreamWorks won three consecutiveAcademy AwardsforBest PictureforAmerican Beauty,GladiatorandA Beautiful Mind(the latter two were co-productions with Universal Pictures). DreamWorks became the first new majorHollywoodmotion picture studio sinceRKO Pictureswas founded in 1928.Go Fish Pictures, a division of DreamWorks with the objective to distributeart-house,independentandforeignfilms, was founded in 2000. The division experienced success with theanimefilmsMillennium Actress(2003) andGhost in the Shell 2: Innocence(2004), respectively, which led them to venture into releasing live-action films, with the release ofThe Chumscrubber. However,The Chumscrubberwas a commercial and critical failure, which led DreamWorks to shut down the division in 2007 shortly after the release of the Japanese filmCasshern.[citation needed]In 2002, DreamWorks signed a deal with In Demand.[21]
For the period beginning October 1, 2004, to January 31, 2006, DreamWorks Pictures distributed its films in the North American domestic theatrical and worldwide television market, with international theatrical and worldwide home entertainment distribution by Universal Pictures.[22]On October 27, 2004, DreamWorks Animation was spun off into a separate public company.
David Geffen admitted that DreamWorks came close to bankruptcy twice. Under Katzenberg's watch, the studio suffered a $125 million loss onSinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas,[23]and also overestimated the DVD demand forShrek 2.[24]In 2005, out of their two large budget pictures,War of the Worldswas produced as a joint effort withParamount Pictureswhich was the first to reap a significant amount of profits, whileThe Islandbombed at the domestic box office but turned a profit internationally throughWarner Bros. Pictures.[23]
In December 2005, theoriginal Viacom, the then-parent of Paramount Pictures, agreed to purchase the live-action studio, still keeping the original name and producing/distribution name. The deal was valued at approximately $1.6 billion, an amount that included about $400 million in debt assumptions.[25]The acquisition of the live-action DreamWorks studio was completed by thesecond iteration of Viacom, which had recentlysplitfrom the original at the end of 2005, on February 1, 2006.[26]
On March 17, 2006, Viacom agreed to sell a controlling interest in the DreamWorks Pictures live-action library toSoros Strategic PartnersandDune EntertainmentII.[27]The film library was valued at $900 million. Paramount Pictures retained the worldwide distribution rights to those films, as well as various ancillary rights, including music publishing (the music publishing rights were later licensed toSony/ATV Music Publishingwhen the company acquired Viacom'sFamous Musicsubdivision), sequels and merchandising. The sale was completed on May 8, 2006.[28]On February 8, 2010, Viacom repurchased Soros' controlling stake in the DreamWorks Pictures library for around $400 million.[29]
In June 2008, it was reported that DreamWorks was looking for financing that would allow it to continue operations, but as an independent production company, once its deal with Paramount ended later that year.[30]Several public equity funds were approached for financing, includingBlackstone Group, Fuse Global,TPG Capitaland several others, but all passed on the deal given their understanding of the Hollywood markets. On September 22, 2008, it was announced that DreamWorks closed a deal with Indian investment firmReliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Groupto create a $1.2 billion stand-alone production company and end its ties with Paramount.[2]In January 2009, Spielberg entered a licensing agreement with DreamWorks Animation to use the DreamWorks trademarks, logo, and name for film productions and releases.[31]
On February 9, 2009, DreamWorks Pictures entered into a long-term, 30-picture distribution deal withWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, by which DreamWorks' films would be released through theTouchstone Picturesbanner, with Disney collecting a 10 percent distribution fee.[32]The deal also included co-funding via a $175 million loan byWalt Disney Studiosto DreamWorks for production and access to slots in Disney's pay television agreement, then withStarz.[32]The agreement was reported to have come after negotiations broke off with Universal Pictures just days earlier.[33]DreamWorks raised $325 million from Reliance Entertainment and an additional $325 million in debt in 2009.[1]On August 18, 2009, DreamWorks and Reliance signed a three-year, $825 million pact for up to six films a year.[34]
DreamWorks' slate of films in 2011,I Am Number Four,Cowboys & Aliens, andFright Nightfailed, whileThe Help,Real Steeland Spielberg'sWar Horsehad success at the box office. This left DreamWorks so financially drained that by 2011, DreamWorks was seeking additional funding from Reliance. Reliance gave a $200 million investment on April 10, 2012. Under the deal, DreamWorks Pictures scaled back production to three films per year and sought co-financiers on big budget films, such as20th Century Fox, who co-financed and handled international distribution forLincolnandBridge of Spies. DreamWorks continued to have Disney distribute and market their films.[1]On August 29, 2012, after re-negotiating their agreement with Disney, DreamWorks formed a deal withMister Smith Entertainmentto distribute its films internationally, while Disney would continue to distribute in North America, Latin America, Australia, Russia, and some territories in Asia.[35]
On September 2, 2015, it was reported that DreamWorks and Disney would not renew their distribution deal, which was set to expire in August 2016,[36][37]withThe Light Between Oceansbeing released in September as the final DreamWorks film distributed by Disney under their original distribution agreement.[38]During that time, DreamWorks was in early negotiations with Universal Pictures to distribute its upcoming films.[36][37]The contract allowing Spielberg to license the DreamWorks name and logo from Jeffrey Katzenberg's DreamWorks Animation was set to expire on January 1, 2016, leading to media speculation that Spielberg would not renew the pact.[31]Disney retained the film rights to the fourteen DreamWorks films it released,[39]as well as acquiring the "DreamWorks II Distribution Co. LLC" copyright from DreamWorks and Reliance on December 11, 2015.[40][41]
On December 16, 2015, Spielberg, Reliance,Entertainment OneandParticipant Mediapartnered to launch the content production companyAmblin Partners,[42]relegating DreamWorks to a brand for adult-themed films produced under the new company.[42][43]In addition to DreamWorks, the new company also would produce films under the Amblin Entertainment and Participant banners. On the same day, Amblin Partners announced a five-year distribution deal with Universal, under which the company's films would be distributed and marketed by either the main Universal label or its specialty label,Focus Features.[44][45]The Girl on the Trainwas the first film released under the new agreement,[39]though a few films, likeGhost in the ShellandThe Postwere released by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox respectively.
The original DreamWorks logo features a boy sitting on acrescent moonwith a fishing rod at night. The general idea for the logo was the idea of the company's founder,Steven Spielberg, who wanted aCGIimage. IllustratorRobert Huntwas commissioned to execute the idea as a painting, and he used his son as the model.[46]The logo was then turned into amotion graphicatIndustrial Light & Magic, in collaboration with Kaleidoscope Films, Dave Carson and Clint Goldman.[47]It was animated by ILM animation supervisorWes Takahashi.[48][49]Music accompanying the logo to start in many live-action DreamWorks films was specially composed byJohn Williams.
The reimagined animation logo had music adapted from the track "Fairytale" forShrek, based on thechildren's picture book of the same nameby authorWilliam Steig. The logo was composed byHarry Gregson-Williamsand made its debut in 2004, with the release ofShrek 2, a film which Gregson-Williams also composed. Two years after its acquisition byUniversal Picturesin 2016, the logo received a new fanfare composed byJohn Powelland incorporate some cues fromShrek 2and tones from Williams' original DreamWorks fanfare to create the music for the logo. The new fanfare debuted in 2019, with the release ofHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, a film for which Powell also composed. In 2022, Harry Gregson-Williams returned to compose a new version of the fanfare, with the debut ofPuss in Boots: The Last Wish.

Sigismondi has also directed television including two episodes ofThe Handmaid's TaleandAmerican Gods.
Sigismondi was born inPescara,Abruzzo, Italy. Her parents, Lina and Domenico Sigismondi, were opera singers. Her family, including her sister Antonella, moved toHamilton,Ontario, Canada[1]when she was two. In her childhood she became obsessed by drawing and painting. Starting in 1987, she studied painting and illustration at theOntario College of Art, today'sOntario College of Art & Design University(OCADU). When she took a photography course, she became obsessed once more, and graduated with a photography major.
Sigismondi started a career as a fashion photographer. She came to directingmusic videoswhen she was approached by the production companyThe Revolver Film Co., and directed music videos for a number of Canadian bands. Her very innovative, but also very disturbing video works, located in sceneries she once described as "entropic underworlds inhabited by tortured souls and omnipotent beings," attracted a number of very prominent musicians. She has further described her works as, "Something quite textural and brutal" and something quite beautiful and light. It's like blending two worlds."[2]
With her photography and sculpture installations she had solo exhibitions inHamiltonandToronto,New York City,Brescia(Italy),Gothenburg(Sweden), and London. Her photographs also were included in numerous group exhibitions, together with artists such asCindy Sherman,Joel-Peter Witkin, andFrancesco Clemente.

"If I don't create them myself, I design or draw them, I can get quite tactile detailed as far as what I see."[2]She has an affinity for strange yet alluring things and created a flesh-esque chair to appeal to the sexual tension and desire to the spectator.[2]
Sigismondi's first feature-length film wasThe Runaways, a period piece about the 1970s all-girl rock and roll bandThe Runaways. The film is largely about the relationship betweenJoan JettandCherie Currie. Sigismondi wrote the screenplay based on Currie's bookNeon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway. The film premiered in 2010 at theSundance Film Festivaland was released in Canada and the United States in March 2010.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
