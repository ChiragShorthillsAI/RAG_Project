TheNational Board of Reviewand theAmerican Film InstitutenamedSoulone of the top ten films of 2020. It was nominated for threeAcademy Awardsat the93rd Academy Awards, winning two, and receivednumerous other accolades.
In New York City, pianist Joe Gardner teaches music part-time at a middle school while dreaming of playing jazz professionally. When he receives an offer to teach full-time, his mother Libba urges him to accept, although Joe is resistant. Joe learns famous jazz musician Dorothea Williams has an opening in her quartet and auditions at a jazz club. Impressed with his piano playing, Dorothea hires him for that night's show. As Joe heads off, his excitement distracts him, and he falls down an openmanhole.
Joe finds himself a disembodied soul heading into anafterlifecalled the "Great Beyond". Unwilling to die, he tries to escape but ends up in the "Great Before" (aka "You Seminar"), a realmwhere new souls are preparedfor life on Earth with guidance from otherworldly counselors — all named Jerry — and experienced souls who act as mentors. Each new soul has a badge that grants passage to Earth once it has been completely filled in with interests and personality traits. Mistaken for a mentor, Joe is assigned to 22, a stubborn soul who has been in the Great Before for thousands of years and hopes to avoid Earth. Intrigued by Joe's desperation to return to an unremarkable life, 22 agrees to let Joe help find her "spark", which will complete her badge and enable Joe to use it to return home. After Joe fails several attempts to find 22 a passion, they visit "the Zone", a place that souls enter when their passions createa euphoric trance, but which becomes a trap for obsessed, lost souls. They meet Moonwind, asign twirlerwho regularly enters the Zone to rescue lost souls, who helps the duo locate Joe's soulless body in a hospital.
Joe returns to Earth but accidentally brings 22 with him, and they awaken in Joe's hospital room in the wrong bodies, with 22 inhabiting Joe's body and Joe inhabiting the body of atherapy cat. They locate Moonwind, who agrees to meet at the jazz club that night to restore Joe to his body. In the meantime, 22 settles into Joe's body and starts to find enjoyment in trivial things like food, wind, and music. She holds poignant conversations with Libba, Joe's student Connie, and Joe's barber Dez, deepening her understanding of life. Meanwhile, Terry, the being in charge of counting souls, discovers the count is off and arrives on Earth to find Joe.
As the day ends, Joe and 22 visit Moonwind to return Joe to his body, but 22, having finally discovered the joy of living, refuses to leave Joe's body and flees. As Joe chases her through a subway station, Terry disconnects them from life and returns them to the Great Before. 22 discovers her badge is complete, but Joe bitterly insists it was the result of experiencing life in his body with his preferences and that she has no purpose of her own. Distraught, 22 throws the badge at him and retreats into the Zone. A Jerry informs Joe that a spark is not a soul's purpose in life, but Joe refuses to believe this and discreetly uses 22's badge to return to Earth.
The show at the jazz club is successful, but Joe is confused when it does not bring the fulfillment he was expecting. Looking at small objects that 22 collected while occupying his body, he recalls the moments they had enjoyed together and realizes these experiences gave 22 her spark. Joe plays piano and enters the Zone to return 22's badge but discovers she has become a lost soul, obsessed with the idea that she has no purpose. Joe chases her down and shows her a maple seed she collected to remind her of her time on Earth. They realize that a spark is not a soul's purpose, but simply a desire to live. Joe's actions restore 22 to normal; he returns her badge and accompanies her for as long as he can on her journey down to Earth.
As Joe prepares to enter the Great Beyond, a Jerry stops him and offers him another chance at life in thanks for finally inspiring 22 to live (while another Jerry distracts Terry to manipulate the count). The next morning, Joe returns to his body on Earth, committed to fully living life.

Soulbegan development in January 2016 following the announcement of the88th Academy Awardswhen directorPete Docterpitched an idea for a new film to then-studio head of PixarJohn Lasseter.[13][14]Docter pondered the origins of human personalities with the concept ofdeterminism. In his first meeting with co-writerMike Jones, Docterpitchedan idea set in theastral planeinvolving souls with personalities.[15]The film spent four years in production,[16]with an approximate $150 million budget.[17]
Docter and Jones worked on the development of the main character for about two years.[15]Initial ideas included portraying Joe as a scientist, which did not feel "so naturally pure". Pixar eventually settled on portraying the film's main character as a musician because they wanted an appealing profession for the audience. According to Docter, once the creative team decided the main character played jazz music, the filmmakers chose to make him African-American due to the race being tied to jazz history.[18][19]
With co-writerKemp Powers's help, Docter wrote Joe during the film's early development. Powers's initial contract was 12-weeks long, but was later extended.[15]After making extensive contributions to the film, Powers became a co-director, making him Pixar's first African-American co-director.[19]Powers based several elements of Joe on his personal life, but wanted the character to "transcend [his] own experience" in order to make him more accessible.[18]Powers also placed additional emphasis on authentically depicting Joe's relationships within the black community.[20]In order to portray accurately African-American culture within the film, Pixar worked closely with an internal "Cultural Trust" composed of black Pixar employees, and hired several consultants. These consultants included musiciansHerbie Hancock,Terri Lyne Carrington,Quincy Jones, andJon Batiste; educatorJohnnetta Cole; and stars Questlove and Diggs.
The idea of Joe's soul entering the body of a therapy cat came from Mike Jones. Docter and Powers appreciated the idea, as it allowed Joe to "be able to look at his own life from a different perspective" and appreciate it. According to Murray, the filmmakers were undecided onSoul'sending before the last screening. Some test versions of the film ended featuring Joe pondering whether to pass on to the Great Beyond; returning to Earth a year later; or staying in the Great Before as a mentor. Initial storyboards featured several brief scenes showing 22's life on Earth after her new birth, including one of her reuniting with Joe in New York. These scenes were ultimately discarded.[21]
In August 2019, it was announced thatJamie Foxx,Tina Fey,Questlove,Phylicia RashadandDaveed Diggshad joined the cast.[2][6]In March 2020,Angela Bassettannounced she was cast in the film. During the release of the film's trailer in October 2020,Richard Ayoade,Graham Norton,Rachel House,Alice Braga,Wes Studi,Fortune Feimster, Zenobia Shroff,Donnell RawlingsandJune Squibbwere also announced to be in the cast.[4]
Docter saidJamie Foxx(himself a classically trained pianist) was perfect for Joe, citing his comedic skills and musical background.[17]Foxx related the film's "bittersweet [feeling] of losing someone but gaining a vision of joy".[22][23]
Tina Fey, in addition to voicing 22, also contributed to the screenplay, helping to write her character's lines.[24]She considered the film, in the context of theCOVID-19 pandemic, a "helpful reminder that [life] isn't defined by achievement or attainment".[22]
Soulis Pixar's first film to feature an African-American lead.[25]Pixar and Docter were mindful of the history of racist imagery (particularly caricatured depictions of African-Americans) in animation and wanted to create black characters[15]as well as integrate authenticAfrican-American cultureinto the film's "DNA" to prevent caricatures, stereotypes, and tropes.[26]Pixar sought to capture the fine details of the characters, including the textures of black hair and the way light plays on various tones of black skin.[15]According to Powers, the animators used lighting in emphasizing the character's ethnic features.[27]CinematographerBradford Youngworked as a lighting consultant on the film.[27]
Animators used footage of several music performers, including Batiste, as reference for the film's musical sequences. By capturingMIDIdata from the sessions, animators retraced the exact key being played on the piano with each note and animated the performances authentically. According to Docter, the animators assigned to specific musical instruments often either had experience playing them or a great appreciation for them.[27][28]
The souls were animated by the filmmakers in a "vaporous", "ethereal", and "non-physical" way. Souls were designed to depict various religious and cultural outlooks.[24]The designs were also inspired by early drawings made by Docter. Animators created two designs for the souls in the film: one for the new souls in "The Great Before" (described as "very cute, very appealing, with simple, rounded shapes" bysupervising animatorJude Brownbill) and one for mentor souls (feature distinctive characteristics since they have been on Earth).[29]They differentiated souls from ghosts by adjusting their color palette accordingly.[30]Animating the souls' designs was challenging and substantial. According to Murray, several artists helped create the souls' designs by giving their suggestions and opinions on how they should look.[31]
The design of soul counselors ("Jerrys") originated fromline drawingsmade by story artist Aphton Corbin. Another artist createdwire sculpturesof them, and the design was finalized.[30]Together, with the design of "Terry", they were seen by critics as a reference toOsvaldo Cavandoli's 1971 Italian animated seriesLa Linea.[32][33][34]
Soul'sfantastical elements were difficult to render. To address the issue, Docter referred to his filmInside Out(2015), where the filmmakers personified through physicality. For the Great Before, the filmmakers did not want it to be based in any specific culture given its nature of universality. They sought inspiration from the architecture of 1930s–1960sworld's fairs, making a "sense of awe and importance".[35]Production designer Steve Pilcher believed in the simplicity of the Great Before, saying that it was complicated and naive.[17]According to Docter, the aim of the design was to "make a grand statement about learning and knowledge."[36]The personality pavilions were designed to be "abstract-looking shapes" as a literal interpretation of the abstract ideas they represent.[35]For the Great Beyond, the filmmakers conceptualized "going toward the light", which they believed the audience would understand.[30]
The astral plane sequence took months to create, despite the actual scene having a short duration.Visual effectssupervisor Bill Watral compared the sequence to the shower scene fromPsycho(1960), taking a long time to film in spite of the actual short time span. During this sequence, filmmakers painstakingly animated sands, liquids, and rocks for the brief sequence.[37]
To animate New York, the filmmakers explored jazz clubs and pizzerias for inspiration. A barbershop scene received additional input from Powers.[17]The animation style moved away from photorealism, depicting the city as distorted and crooked.[38]
MusiciansTrent ReznorandAtticus RossofNine Inch Nailscomposed anambientscorefor the metaphysical segments of the film, while Batiste composed a number of originaljazzsongs for the New York City-based segments of the film.[39][40]Batiste created a "user-friendly jazz", which felt "authentic" but could still be appreciated by a general audience.[18][41]Ross composed a "somewhat ominous" musical cue in the afterlife walkway scene, which also incorporated real-world sounds.[17]Reznor and Ross were brought in on the recommendation of sound designerRen Klyce, who had worked extensively with the duo inDavid Fincherfilms.[42]
The score and the original songs fromSoulwere released in twovinyl-exclusive albums, while also compiled onto a single digital album.[43][44]"It's All Right", the end credits song performed by Batiste, was originally recorded byThe Impressions. A second cover of the song, a duet between Batiste and British soul singerCeleste, was released alongside the film.[45]
Soulhad its premiere on October 11, 2020, at theBFI London Film Festival.[46][47]It was initially scheduled for theatrical release in the United States on June 19,[48]but was later pushed back to November 20, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,[49]beforeDisneydecided to release the film onDisney+on December 25. UnlikeMulan,Soulwas not released throughDisney+ Premier Access, making it free for all subscribers.[50]On December 5, 2023, it was announced thatSoul, as well asTurning Red(2022) andLuca(2021), would be released in theaters in the United States throughout early 2024, withSoulbeing released on January 12, 2024.[51]
In international markets where Disney+ was not available,Soulwas released theatrically.[52]These included China,[53]the Philippines,[54][55]Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, among others.[56]The film was included in their lineups of the2020 Cannes Film Festival[57]and theRome Film Festival; it opened on October 15.[58]In theaters,Soulwas intended to be accompanied bySparkShortsshort filmBurrow, but it premiered on Disney+ instead;[59]the short would accompany the film's 2024 theatrical release.[51]A prequel short toSoulwas released in 2021, titled22 vs. Earth. It focuses on 22 leading a rebellion against her superiors.[60]

Following the release ofSoulonDisney+, research firm Screen Engine reported that 13 percent of viewers watched the film, and it over-indexed among parents, particularly mothers. The company also said thatSoulwas among the most-watched straight-to-streaming titles of the year, behindHamiltonandWonder Woman 1984.[66]On December 21–27, 2020, the film gathered 1.669 billion minutes of watch time, making it the number 1 streaming title that week.[67]Nielsenreported thatWonder Woman 1984, with 2.252 billion minutes of streaming onHBO Max, had surpassedSoul, with 1.7 billion minutes on Disney+, in streaming numbers on Christmas weekend.[68]Samba TVlater reported that 2.4 million households streamed the film over its opening weekend.[69]Nielsen reported thatSoulwas the most streamed film across all platforms, during the week from January 4–10, 2021.[70]
Soulreceived critical acclaim.[71][72][73]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on 360 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The consensus reads; "A film as beautiful to contemplate as it is to behold,Soulproves Pixar's power to deliver outstanding all-ages entertainment remains undimmed."[74]Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assignedSoula score of 83 out of 100 based on 55 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[75]
Several journalists praisedSoulfor its craftsmanship,[76][77]which they saw as an exercise of Docter's expertise,[78][79]as the film was considered a return of Pixar's form by some critics.[80][81]Leslie Felperin (The Hollywood Reporter) and Jason Solomons (TheWrap) described the film as its peak, with Solomons characterized its "colorful visuals and gentle wisdom".[9][82]A. O. ScottofThe New York Timesexpressed its "combination of skill, feeling, and inspiration".[83]
The story, characters, and music were also commended. Kaleem Aftab ofIndieWirefelt the narrative "[veered] off in many unexpected directions, so that even the inevitable end point feels just right."[7]USA Today'sBrian Truitt commended the performances of Foxx and Fey.[84]ForTime Out Dubai, Whelan Barzey believed Joe's story could appeal to many generations.[85]Felperin andPeter Travers(ABC News) praised the musical score, calling it "sublime".[9][86]Truitt and Travers credited Batiste, Reznor, and Ross for their music merits.[84][86]
Reviews were not uniformly positive. Kirsten Acuna fromInsiderfelt that "the studio had taken a few steps backward" in their racial "sensitivity" asSoulused the same trope of "turning Black characters into creatures".[87]Molly Freeman ofScreen Rantacknowledged the film's "message about the meaning of life and finding purpose, but it's messy and only made muddier by the questions the movie sets up then fails to answer. The result isSoulloses much of its emotional impact, with the third act playing out more like a rush to the finish line of the story without giving as much weight to the themes and emotional throughline of the film."[88]Charles Pulliam-Moore ofGizmodowrote that "Soulcomes across less like an earnest and casual celebration of everyday Blackness, and more like a twee depiction of it that's meant for white audiences' consumption."[89]Namwali Serpell ofThe New Yorkerpublished an extensive critical essay of the film, citing among other issues, "Not only does Twenty-two use Joe as a vehicle but the movie must also make the grandiose and grotesque claim that he has learned to live through her" and concluding that "The most glaring artistic error in 'Soul' is its misprision—its elision, really—of what soul means for black culture."[90]
At the93rd Academy Awards,Soulreceived a nomination forBest Sound, and wonBest Animated FeatureandBest Original Score.[91]Its other nominations include tenAnnie Awards(winning seven),[92]threeBritish Academy Film Awards(winning two),[93]aCritics' Choice Movie Award(which it won),[94][95]and twoGolden Globe Awards(winning both).[96][97]TheNational Board of Reviewand theAmerican Film InstitutenamedSoulone of the ten-best films of 2020; it also won the National Board of Review'sBest Animated Filmaward.[98][99]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo.

Peter Hans Docter[1](born October 9, 1968) is an American filmmaker and animator, who has served aschief creative officer(CCO) ofPixarsince 2018.[2][3]He has directed the company's animated filmsMonsters, Inc.(2001),Up(2009),Inside Out(2015), andSoul(2020). From his nineAcademy Awardnominations, he is a record-three time recipient ofBest Animated FeatureforUp,Inside OutandSoul. Docter has also won sixAnnie Awardsfrom nine nominations, aBAFTA Children's Film Awardand aHochi Film Award.[4]He describes himself as a "geeky kid from Minnesota who likes to draw cartoons".[3]
Docter was born on October 9, 1968 inBloomington, Minnesota, the son of Rita Margaret (Kanne) and David Reinhardt Docter.[5]His mother's family isDanish American.[6]He grew upintrovertedandsocially isolated, preferring to work alone and having to remind himself to connect with others. He often played in thecreekbeside his house, pretending to beIndiana Jonesand acting out scenes.[7]A junior-high classmate later described him as "this kid who was really tall, but who was kind of awkward, maybe getting picked on by the school bullies because his voice change at puberty was very rough."[3]
Both his parents worked in education: his mother, Rita, taught music and his father, Dave, was a choral director atNormandale Community College. Docter and his two sisters took music lessons at theMacPhail Center for Music, where they were taught theviolinandviolain theSuzuki method. Unlike his two sisters, Kirsten Docter, who was the violist and a founding member of theCavani String Quartet, and Kari Docter, acellistwith theMetropolitan Opera, Docter was not particularly interested inmusicas he didn't like to practice the violin, although he learned to play thedouble bassand played with the orchestras for the soundtracks ofMonsters, Inc.[8]andUp.[9]
Docter attended Nine Mile Elementary School, Oak Grove Junior High, andJohn F. Kennedy High Schoolin Bloomington. Hetaught himselfcartooning, makingflip booksand homemade animated shorts with a family movie camera.[3]He later described his interest inanimationas a way to "play God", making up nearly living characters. Cartoon directorChuck Jones, producerWalt Disney, and cartoonistJack Daviswere major inspirations.[10]
He spent about a year at theUniversity of Minnesota[3]studying bothphilosophyand makingart[10]before transferring to theCalifornia Institute of the Arts, where he won aStudent Academy Awardfor his production "Next Door" and graduated in 1990 with aBachelor of Fine Arts.[11]Although Docter had planned to work forWalt Disney Animation Studios, his best offers came fromPixarand fromthe producers ofThe Simpsons.[3]He did not think much of Pixar at that time,[10]and later considered his choice to work there a strange and unusual one.[12]
Before joiningPixar, Docter had created three non-computer animations,Next Door,Palm Springs, andWinter.[13]All three shorts were later preserved by theAcademy Film Archive.[14]He was a fan of the company's early short films, but he knew nothing about them otherwise. He commented in an October 2009 interview, "Looking back, I kind of go, what was I thinking?"[15]
He started at Pixar in 1990 at the age of 21 afterJohn Lasseterasked his former classmate the lateJoe Ranft, who was one of Docter's teachers atCalArts, to recommend any students who would be a good fit for the company.[16][7][17][18]Deciding to follow his instincts and what "felt right" at the time, he accepted the job offer from then obscure Pixar and began work there the day after his college graduation[16][12]as the tenth employee at the company's animation group[10]and its thirdanimator.[19]Docter instantly felt at home in the tight-knit atmosphere of the company. He has said, "Growing up ... a lot of us felt we were the only person in the world who had this weird obsession with animation. Coming to Pixar you feel like, 'Oh! There are others!'"[3]
Docter had been brought in with limited responsibilities, but Lasseter quickly assigned him larger and larger roles in writing, animation, sound recording, and orchestra scoring.[15]He was one of the three key screenwriters behind the concept ofToy Story, and partially based the character ofBuzz Lightyearon himself.[10]He had a mirror on his desk and made faces with it as he conceptualized the character.[15]
Docter's fascination with character development was further influenced by a viewing ofPaper Moon, he told journalistRobert K. Elderin an interview forThe Film That Changed My Life.[20]
I like the more character-driven stuff, andPaper Moonbrought that home to me in a way that I had not seen in live action, really focusing on the whole story just about characters. It was almost theatrical in the same way you might see a stage show because you're locked in a room. It's got to be about characters, and yet it was so cinematic, a film that couldn't be done in any other medium. It just kind of blew my socks off.[21]
Docter has been an integral part of some of Pixar's most seminal works, includingToy Story,Toy Story 2,A Bug's LifeandMonsters, Inc., all of which received critical acclaim and honors. He contributed to these animated films as a co-author to the scripts, and worked withCGIstalwarts such as Lasseter,Ronnie del Carmen,Bob Peterson,Andrew Stanton,Brad Bird, andJoe Ranft. Docter has referred to his colleagues at Pixar as a bunch of "wild stallions".[12]He is also one of the five founding members of the Pixar Braintrust, which came together during the making ofToy Story(the other four being Lasseter, Stanton, Ranft and Unkrich).[22]
Docter made his directorial debut withMonsters, Inc.—the first Pixar film not directed by Lasseter—which occurred right after the birth of his first child, Nick. Docter has said that the abrupt move from a complete, single-minded devotion to his career to parenting drove him "upside down" and formed the inspiration for the storyline.[23]In 2004, he was asked by Lasseter to direct theEnglishtranslation ofHowl's Moving Castle.[24]Docter then directed the 2009 filmUp, released on May 29, 2009. He based the protagonist ofUppartially on himself, based on his frequent feelings of social awkwardness and his desire to get away from crowds to contemplate.[7]Following the success ofUp, Docter and fellowPixarveterans Lasseter, Stanton andLee Unkrichas well as long-time collaborator and directorBrad Birdwere honored with theGolden Lion Honorary Award for Lifetime Achievementat the66th Venice International Film Festival.[25][26]Docter directed the 2015 filmInside Outto critical acclaim.[27]His next film,Soul, was released onDisney+on December 25, 2020, to critical acclaim.[28][29]
Docter appeared at Comic-Con 2008 and the 2009 WonderCon.[30]
In May 2009, Docter remarked retrospectively toChristianity Todaythat he had lived "a blessed life" so far.[7]The A.V. Clubhas called him "almost universally successful".[12]He has been nominated for eightOscars(winning three), threeAnnie Awards(winning two), fourBAFTA Film Awards(winning two), aBritish Academy Children's Award(which he won), and aHochi Film Award(which he won).[4]Accepting his firstAcademy Award for Best Animated Feature, he said, "Never did I dream that making a flip book out of my third-grade math book would lead to this."[31]Docter served as Vice-President of Creativity atPixar Animation Studiosthrough June 2018, and following Lasseter stepping down from the role, became the studio's chief creative officer.[2][32]TheWrapreported that Docter planned to complete the film he began working on in 2016, which ultimately becameSoul.[33]
Docter received theWinsor McCay Awardat the 2023 Annie Awards ceremony along with fellow animatorsCraig McCrackenandEvelyn Lambart, for his "unparalleled achievement and exceptional contributions to animation".[34]
Docter is married to Amanda Docter and has two children, Nicholas and Elie.[7]Elie has a speaking part inUpand was the inspiration for the character of Riley inInside Out.[35]
Docter is afanofanime, particularly the work ofHayao Miyazaki. Docter has said that Miyazaki's animation has "beautifully observed little moments of truth that you just recognize and respond to".[24]He is also a fan of the filmography of Pixar competitorDreamWorks. Referring to the competitive environment, he has said: "I think it's a much healthier environment when there is more diversity".[12]
During an interview in 2009, Docter confirmed that he is aChristianand said that it influences his work. However, he went on to say that he did not envision himself ever creating a Christian film.[10]About the relationship between his faith and his filmmaking, Docter has said:
I don't think people in any way, shape, or form like to be lectured to. When people go to a movie, they want to see some sort of experience of themselves on the screen. They don't come to be taught. So in that sense, and in terms of any sort of beliefs, I don't want to feel as though I'm ever lecturing or putting an agenda forth.[7]
Critical, public and commercial reception to films Docter has directed as of January 9, 2021.Soulwas released directly toDisney+in 2020 primarily in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which was a contributing factor to its box office earnings.Soulwould later have a limited theatrical run in 2024.[56][57]
Pete Docter has cast certain actors and crew members in multiple of the films he has directed.

Bassett was born in New York City, to Betty Jane (née Gilbert), a social worker and civil servant,[4]the second wife of Daniel Benjamin Bassett, a preacher's son.[5][6][7]Bassett's middle name was given to her in honor of her aunt Evelyn.[6]Ten months after Bassett was born, her mother became pregnant and had a second child, Bassett's sister D'nette. Bassett said the pregnancy "only made things harder", leading her parents to send her to her father's sister, Golden, inWinston-Salem, North Carolina. While her aunt did not have any children of her own, she "loved children, and she was good with them."[8]
At the age of four, Bassett was picked up by her mother after her parents divorced; her mother took her and her sister toSt. Petersburg, Florida.[9]
Bassett did not see her father again for several years, until she attended her grandmother's funeral. There, Bassett met her father's daughter Jean, from his first marriage, who was twelve years old, and several years older than Bassett.[10]
After graduating from Jordan Park Elementary School, Bassett wasbusedto attend Disston Middle School for seventh grade. She began at that school in 1970, a year before the city of St. Petersburg formally established busing to integrate its public schools. After completing seventh grade, Bassett was bused to Azalea Middle School for eighth and ninth grades. Bassett's mother became more involved in her daughters' studies and told the two that they would go to college.[11]
In her younger years, Bassett was "in love" with theJackson 5, and dreamed of marrying a member of the family group. She said her choice would probably be "whoever had the cutest, roundest Afro at the time. In my imagination we would have children and live in a real house."[10]As her interest in entertainment developed, Angela and her sister would often put on shows, reading poems or performing popular music for their family.[12]
AtBoca Ciega High School, Bassett was a cheerleader and a member of theUpward Boundcollege prep program, the debate team, student government, drama club and choir. An "A" and "B" student for the most part, Bassett got her first "C" in physical education. She tried to convince her mother not to be disappointed by the grade. Bassett called the grade the "average," leading her mother to say she did not have "average kids." As Bassett described, she developed a "sense of pride"  and did not get another "C" until college.[13]During high school, Bassett became the first African American in that school to be admitted to theNational Honor Society. The Upward Bound program is an academic and cultural enrichment program for underprivileged students. Bassett says she and the other participants did not see themselves as underprivileged.[12]
Bassett studied atYale Universityand graduated with aBachelor of ArtsinAfrican American Studiesin 1980.[14]She studied acting at theYale School of Dramaand obtained aMaster of Fine Artsin 1983. Her paternal aunt had warned her not to "waste" her "Yale education on theater." She was the only member of Bassett's family to have gone to both college and graduate school.[13]
At Yale, Bassett met her future husbandCourtney B. Vance, a 1986 graduate of the drama school. Bassett was also classmates with actorCharles S. Dutton.[15]
After graduation, Bassett worked as a receptionist for a beauty salon and as a photo researcher to support herself while looking for acting work in the New York theater. One of her first New York performances came in 1985 when she appeared inJ. E. Franklin'sBlack GirlatSecond Stage Theatre. She appeared in twoAugust Wilsonplays at theYale Repertory Theatreunder the direction of her long-time instructorLloyd Richards; these wereMa Rainey's Black Bottom(1984), andJoe Turner's Come and Gone(1986).

Bassett earned industry attention and public recognition for her early performances in the filmsBoyz n the Hood(1991) andMalcolm X(1992). For her portrayal ofBetty Shabazzin the latter, she earned anNAACP Image Award. The movie received a mixed critical reception.  One negative review, for example, judged thatMalcolm Xfailed to "capture" the rage ofMalcolm X's autobiography.[18]During production, directorSpike Leeshowed Bassett a tape of the exact moment when Malcolm X was shot, since they would be filming the scene. Bassett called the recording "haunting," but noted that afterward she was "able to grab hold of the pain and re-create the scene." Bassett felt it was important for her to get the assassination scene correct, and wondered how Betty "found the strength to keep going, to raise her family, to educate, to sustain them."[19]Bassett worried that after her role as Betty Shabazz inMalcolm X, she would not find another role "as satisfying." At the time of the film's release, she expressed her worry that she would not have such a role again. "I think I have been incredibly blessed and it is probably just all downhill from here."[20]
Bassett also starred asKatherine JacksoninThe Jacksons: An American Dream, which premiered on ABC-TV in the same week as the theatrical release ofMalcolm X. After returning to Los Angeles following completion of her work forMalcolm X, Bassett got a call to audition for a movie aboutTina Turner, based on her memoirI, Tina.[21]Bassett won the lead role overHalle BerryandRobin Givens, but had only one month to prepare before filming began. She met with Tina Turner twice, who advised her on details of her interpretation, from wigs and outfits to dancing styles. Turner also did Bassett's make-up, leading Bassett to call her "supportive" and her "biggest fan."[17]In an interview with theOrlando Sentinel, Bassett described going to one of Turner's concerts and, after realizing that she knew some of Turner's dance moves, she cried and was "almost a river of tears."[22]Bassett's performance as Turner inWhat's Love Got to Do with It(1993) received strong reviews.[23][24]Marc Bernardin ofEntertainment Weeklywrote that Bassett "gave the performance of a lifetime" portraying Turner in the biopic.[25]Bassett won aGolden Globefor her portrayal, and was the first African American to win thisAward for Best Actress. She was nominated for anAcademy Awardas Best Actress, but lost toHolly HunterforThe Piano.  (Despite the acclaim, Bassett later said in a 2022 interview onToday with Hoda & Jenna, that after portraying Turner, she did not receive acting calls for about a year and a half.)
Bassett starred in three movies in 1995, which received varying reviews:Vampire in Brooklyn,Strange Days, andWaiting to Exhale. (For the latter she worked with authorTerry McMillan, who had written the book of the same title that was adapted for film). InStrange Days, Bassett played Lornette "Mace" Mason, a chauffeur and bodyguard. InVampire in Brooklyn, she played Rita Veder, a tortured cop with a dark secret.

Bassett had previously worked with Craven on television shows.[26]Bassett's character inWaiting to Exhale, Bernadine Harris, was betrayed by her husband. In revenge she set fire to his entire wardrobe and vehicle, then sold what was left for one dollar. Bassett described the scene and her character in this film to theOrlando Sentinel: She said, "The thing is that my character is thinking about how her husband has left her. I have a cigarette in one hand, and I'm drinking. Basically, the four of us are sitting there talking about men and having some fun."[22]
In 1997, Bassett starred as the President's advisor inContact.[27]Stephen Holden ofThe New York Timesopined that Bassett was "largely wasted as a Presidential assistant."[28]In 1998, Bassett starred inHow Stella Got Her Groove Back, once again collaborating with McMillan.

She was praised for her  performance byVariety[29]and theWashington Post.[30]Stephen Holden ofThe New York Timessaid Bassett's character was "the best thing in the movie" and wrote the actress "portrays this high-strung superwoman with such intensity that she makes her almost believable."[31]In 1999, Bassett starred inMusic of the Heart, once again collaborating with horror directorWes Craven.[32][33]Matthew Eng wrote of her "terrifically specific chemistry" withMeryl Streep.[34]
In 2000, Bassett turned down the lead role inMonster's Ballbecause of the script's sexual content. Halle Berry won theAcademy Award for Best Actressfor her performance in the role.

Todd McCarthy ofVarietywrote that inBoesman and LenaBassett "abandons her recently cultivated glamorous image to dig to the core of Lena's fierce, probing, contentious, compassionate character."[37]Kevin Thomas of theLos Angeles Timeswrote that Bassett captured all of her character's "mercurial mood swings", and both Bassett and her costarDanny Glover"rise to the challenge of these larger-than-life roles, just as you would expect."[38]
She appeared in the 2001 filmThe Score. Her character was in a relationship withRobert De Niro's. She read the film's script and became interested. She was telephoned by directorFrank Oz, who told her Robert De Niro would "like to meet with you".

The following year, in 2002, Bassett acted inSunshine StateandThe Rosa Parks Story. InThe Rosa Parks Story, Bassett was cast asRosa Parks.[40]Laura Fries ofEntertainment Weeklywrote that Bassett "takes her physical strength and turns it inward to portray Parks" and expressed her belief that "lesser hands" would allow for misinterpretation or gross underplay of Parks's personality.[41]In addition to positive reception of her role, Bassett was seen as the "star" of the film due to her performance and earned a nomination for aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Moviefor her performance.[42]
In 2003, she read from the WPA slave narratives inUnchained Memories. In the 1930s, about 100,000 former enslaved African Americans were still alive.

When asked if the film was easier to act in than the more intense roles she had in the past, Bassett said, "This was much easier. This was a walk in the park. It was pretty easy compared to some of the roles I've done that call for so much emotion or physicality." At the time of the film's release, she described both Bernie Mac andLaurence Fishburne, whom she had worked with in the past, her "favorites" and said the pair were both "highly professional and extraordinarily talented."[48]The only film she appeared in during the following year wasMr. and Mrs. Smithin an uncredited voice role.[49]In the 2006 filmAkeelah and the Bee, Bassett portrayed Tanya Anderson, the mother of the film's lead, Akeelah, played byKeke Palmer.

Her role was seen as an "extended cameo" by Brian Lowry ofVariety.[52]
Bassett provided her voice for the 2007 filmMeet the Robinsons.[53]When asked about her motives in taking on the role, Bassett said, "For one, it was a character I had never played before, which is always important to me, to keep me sharp. But it was also the desire to be part of a well-written movie that has something really positive to say about families and about all the different ways there can be to make a family."[54]
She appeared in the 2008 filmGospel Hill.[55][56]Stephen Holden ofThe New York Timeswrote that Bassett's "fiery self-possession brings a spark of passion to her stick-figure character".[57]She next appeared inOf Boys and Men, portraying Rieta Cole, the matriarch of a Chicago family who is killed in an accident in the beginning of the film; she appears in flashbacks for the remainder of the film.

And to cross the water, to countries where people will never meet people who look like me. So it becomes a bigger thing than me just becoming a movie star, and me just being on TV. So if you're going to show every black woman as 400lb or every black woman as the prostitute on the street ...

Lesser directors like to use his face as a blunt symbol of the Native American experience, as a mask of nobility, of suffering, of pain that’s unknowable only because no one has asked the man wearing it. In the right movie, though, Studi doesn’t just play with a character’s facade; he peels its layers. A master of expressive opacity, he shows you the mask and what lies beneath, both the thinking and the feeling."[4]

They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
