The New Mutantsis a 2020 Americansuperhero filmbased on theMarvel Comicsteamof the same name. It is a spin-off film in theX-Menfilm seriesand the thirteenth and final installment overall. The film was directed byJosh Boonefrom a screenplay he wrote with Knate Lee, and it starsMaisie Williams,Anya Taylor-Joy,Charlie Heaton,Alice Braga,Blu Hunt,Henry Zaga, andAdam Beach. In the film, a group of youngmutantsheld in a secret facility fight to save themselves.
Boone and Lee first began work on the film after Boone completedThe Fault in Our Stars(2014). The pair pitched a potential film trilogy toX-MenproducerSimon Kinberg, and in May 2015 they were officially signed on to the project. Taylor-Joy and Williams were rumored to be cast in March 2016 and were confirmed over a year later when the rest of the cast filled out. Filming took place inBoston,Massachusetts, from July to September 2017, primarily atMedfield State Hospital, with an April 2018 release in mind. The film was then delayed while reshoots were planned andDisney began the process of acquiring production company 20th Century Fox. After the acquisition was completed, Boone returned to work on the film, and it was completed without reshoots in March 2020.
The New Mutantswas theatrically released in the United States on August 28, 2020, by20th Century Studios. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was abox office flop, grossing $49.2 million worldwide against its production budget of $67–80 million.
Danielle "Dani" Moonstar, a youngCheyenneNative American, is hidden in a tree by her father as her entire reservation is devastated by a tornado, leaving her the only survivor. After falling unconscious, Dani awakens in an oddly empty hospital run byDr. Cecilia Reyes, who comforts Dani, explaining that she is not an ordinary human being but, rather, has uniquemutantDNA, and she advises her to remain in the hospital until she learns the effects and how to control them.
Dani is introduced to four other teenagers:Samuel "Sam" Guthrie,Illyana Rasputin,Roberto "Bobby" da CostaandRahne Sinclair. Like Dani, the others possess superhuman abilities due to the mutations in their DNA. Reyes, a mutant herself who can manipulate plasma-energy force fields, has brought each of them to the hospital, after they have each either experienced, or accidentally caused, a horrible tragedy:
During her first day, where Illyana implies there is nothing stopping her, Dani attempts to escape, but is stopped by a force field created by Reyes surrounding the entire hospital grounds. Further frustrated from Illyana's harshness, being stirred by the grief of losing her family, she plans to commit suicide from the church clock-tower, but is prevented by Rahne, earning a friend in Dani. The two begin to form a romantic relationship, but Illyana antagonizes Dani, who discovers that Illyana has a hand puppet of a purple dragon calledLockheed. Collectively, the five teenagers believe they are being trained to join theX-Men, hence the strict supervision. Reyes warns them that they are considered dangerous and should not leave until they have mastered their superhuman abilities. Soon, the group all begin to have horrifyingly real visions of their past tragedies, one of which results in Rahne getting branded on the neck by the same Priest whom she had previously killed. During this, Dani undergoes a neural test, inadvertently discovering Reyes's true intentions. Both Illyana and Reyes deduce that the visions are the result of Dani's powers manifesting themselves: the ability to physically manifest the greatest fears and darkest secrets from a person's mind into reality as tangible illusions. Reyes consults her employers, theEssex Corporation, who instruct her to collect Dani's DNA and then terminate her.
As Reyes straps her to a gurney, Dani's panic causes her powers to go haywire. Illyana and Sam are attacked by physical manifestations of Illyana's childhood abusers - monstrous humanoid creatures called the "Smiling Men" - while Roberto, who was attacked by one of the Smiling Men, tries in vain to break through the hospital's outer barrier, which has now contracted in diameter. Rahne, who was suspicious of Reyes's next "procedure", arrives in half-wolf form and mauls Reyes, forcing her to flee. The five regroup in Reyes's office and realize that Reyes was training them to be assassins for Essex and that, to escape, they must kill Reyes to deprive the force fields of their power source. They find and confront Reyes, who warns them that Dani is too powerful and will destroy them all due to the lack of control over her power.
Reyes restricts them all with force fields and tries to again kill Dani by asphyxiating her with a force field, which unleashes theDemon Bear– Dani's own fears manifested through her power, and the true cause of her reservation's destruction – on her; Reyes is devoured and Dani is rendered unconscious. Rahne tries to reach through to Dani's subconscious and urges her to wake up, while Illyana uses her powers to travel to her "special place" where she retrieves a glowing sword, armor and a tiny, physical manifestation of Lockheed to battle the Demon Bear. Eventually, Sam and Roberto join the fight, as well as Rahne, all to no avail. Dani is visited by her father's spirit, who encourages her to face her fear; she awakens and confronts the bear, calming and thus dissipating it. As day breaks, the group leaves the now unshielded facility to find the nearest town.
Additionally,Sarah Michelle Gellarappears in archival footage from theBuffy the Vampire Slayerepisode "Hush", showing clips of the "Gentlemen" who resemble the Smiley Men.Dafne Keenalso appears asLaura / X-23in archival footage fromLogan(2017).
In 2009,X-Menfilm seriesproducerLauren Shuler Donnerrevealed to/Filmher interest in a film adaptation of theNew Mutantscomics but that it had yet to be pitched to20th Century Fox.[16]After completing work on the 2014 filmThe Fault in Our Starsfor 20th Century Fox, directorJosh Boonecreated a comic book with his childhood best friend Knate Lee using panels fromChris ClaremontandBill Sienkiewicz'sNew Mutantscomics to illustrate what a potential film trilogy adapting those comics would be like. The pair had been fans of the characters growing up, with Boone calling the stories "really dark, interesting, and different from the typicalX-Menstories that we had read". Boone and Lee took the comic toSimon Kinberg, one of the producers of theX-Menfilm series, who "really liked it".[17]In May 2015, Fox finalized a deal to have Boone directThe New Mutants, from a script by himself and Lee, with Kinberg and Donner producing. The film was initially intended to expand the universe of theX-Menfranchise and take place three years afterX-Men: Apocalypse(2016).[18][19]While working on the first draft of the script, Boone sent it and his ideas for the film to Sienkiewicz, who thought Boone "had it figured out" and was not just copying the comics.[20]
Updating the status of the film in March 2016, Kinberg said that Boone and Lee were working on the script, and that, likeDeadpool(2016), the film would be different from the coreX-Menfilms, "maybe not as different asDeadpool, but it has its own unique, original voice to it". Kinberg said that the film would have ayoung adult"vibe", and that there was potential for characters seen in previous films to appear, namelyWarpath,Sunspot, andProfessor X, who all have ties to the New Mutants in the comics.[21]Also at that time, it was reported thatMaisie WilliamsandAnya Taylor-Joywere being looked at to star in the film asRahne Sinclair / WolfsbaneandIllyana Rasputin / Magik, respectively. The rest of the title team was expected to consist of the charactersSam Guthrie / Cannonball, Roberto da Costa / Sunspot, andDanielle Moonstar / Mirage.[22]Sunspot previously appeared inX-Men: Days of Future Past, portrayed byAdan Canto, who was not confirmed to be returning for the new film.[23]James McAvoy, who portrayed Professor X in several previousX-Menfilms, was said to have a significant role in this one, alongsideAlexandra Shipp, who was expected to reprise her role ofStormfromX-Men: Apocalypse.[22]
In May 2016, Kinberg confirmed that the script included Professor X, and he stated his hope for filming to start at the beginning of 2017.[24]By that August, the titular team's roster had expanded to include the characterWarlock, whileScott NeustadterandMichael H. Weber—who worked with Boone writingThe Fault in Our Stars—were working on a new draft of the script while Boone and Lee were busy on another project.[17][25]In November, the report of Williams and Taylor-Joy's casting was believed to be accurate, andNat Wolffwas being looked at for the role of Cannonball after working with Boone onThe Fault in Our Stars. The characterDemon Bearwas set as the film's main antagonist, with the project aiming for more of a "'Stephen KingmeetsJohn Hughes'-style horror movie".[26]Boone soon noted that the Demon Bear was a very personal villain for him as a child, as he "was raised by very religious parents. They wereEvangelicalSouthern Baptistsand they believed in therapture; they believedthe devilwas real; they believed indemons."[27][17]
The film entered pre-production inBoston,Massachusetts, in April 2017, in preparation for filming to begin in that city. Location scouting took place, including atMedfield State Hospitalwhich was previously used as a filming location forShutter Island(2010).[28]Fox scheduledNew Mutantsfor an April 13, 2018 release.[29]Several weeks later, the studio officially announced the casting of Taylor-Joy and Williams and that it was "making serious efforts to find ethnically appropriate actors" for the rest of the cast, searching for South American and Native American actors to respectively play Sunspot and Moonstar. By then, McAvoy was no longer slated to appear in the film;[30]Wolff was no longer in the running to portray Cannonball;[30]and Karen Rosenfelt was producing alongside Kinberg,[10]who ultimately spent much of production focused on makingDark Phoenix(2019).[31]
At the end of May,Henry Zagawas expected to be cast as Sunspot,[27]andRosario Dawson—who also portrays the Marvel characterClaire Templeacross the variousMarvel Netflix television series—was in talks to join the film asCecilia Reyes, a mentor to the titular team. It was explained that McAvoy was no longer involved due to Professor X being written out of the script with further drafts, and Shipp's Storm had likewise been written out of the film.[7]Illyana's brotherColossus, another character seen in previousX-Menfilms, also does not appear despite being included in early versions of the script, with Boone choosing to save him for future films.[32]Boone confirmed the film would be "a full-fledged horror movie set within theX-Menuniverse. There are no costumes. There are no supervillains. We're trying to do something very, very different."[27]He had previously said that he does not like horror films, except for "classic ones" such asThe Exorcist(1973),Rosemary's Baby(1968), andThe Shining(1980), but was looking to "pioneer and champion doing prestige versions of horror films" based on his love for horror novels such as King's works.[17]At the end of the month,Charlie Heatonwas in talks to portray Cannonball.[11]
Zaga, Dawson, and Heaton were confirmed to have been cast at the start of June,[13][14]and newcomerBlu Huntwas cast as Moonstar after an extensive and challenging international search that prioritized "ethnic authenticity". The character was believed to be central to the Demon Bear storyline that the film focuses on.[13]At the end of that month, Dawson exited the film, andAlice Bragawas cast as Reyes in her place.[12]The final shooting script for the film included contributions fromScott Frank,[33]Josh Zetumer,ChadandCarey Hayes,Seth Grahame-Smith, Neustadter and Weber, along with a six-person "writer's room" that Fox hired to generate ideas for the film and also "tear apart the script and put it back together". Throughout the development process on the film, the script evolved from the "full horror" film that Boone and Lee initially wanted to make, and which Fox was resistant to, to a compromise version without "excessive blood and scares" and more "young adult"-focused.[31]Boone created storyboards with artist Ashley R. Guillory to plan out all of the shots before filming.[34]
The casting of Henry Zaga as Roberto da Costa was met with some controversy. Zaga, while Brazilian in real life, portrays a character who in the comics is ofAfro-Braziliandescent. Boone stated, "my goal was to cast a real Brazilian and I saw 300 of myself black, brown, lighter-skinned. I saw every shade of the sun. It was the same case with Blu Hunt...My goal was to find the best actor who, because they've done so little work, was at least the closest to kind of what I saw in my head for the character...maybe if Henry didn't exist, I would have found somebody who was darker skinned who exemplified what I needed. But it was never about the color of their skin for me." He added that he was not concerned with the real life racism that existed in Brazil and that he wanted the character to be a positive representation of the nation.[35]
Principal photographybegan on July 10, 2017, in Boston, under theworking titleGrowing Pains.[28][36][37]Peter Demingserved as cinematographer for the film.[36]The majority of the film was shot on location at Medfield State Hospital, where Boone said every crew member had "weird things happen to them".[clarification needed]Boone wanted to use practical effects as much as possible to make the film feel like the horror movies that he grew up with. For example, he had actors push on sheets ofspandexto create the effect of figures pushing through the walls of a room, a technique originated byWes Craven. Ten percent of the film usedgreen screen.[38]On the film's set, Boone explained that the script had been re-written following the mixed critical response ofApocalypse, so that the plot is set during modern day rather than in the 1980s, which removed Professor X and Storm from the story. Boone felt the film was not largely affected by this change since its confined location and lack of technology meant "it might as well be the 80s in terms of the setting. It didn't change our story very much."[39]
Fox chairman and CEOStacey Sniderdescribed the film's setting as aBreakfast Clubdetention crossed with aCuckoo's Nestinstitution. She said the film was "a haunted-house movie with a bunch of hormonal teenagers. We haven't seen a superhero movie whose genre is more likeThe Shiningthan'we're teenagers let's save the world.'"[40]Boone was also influenced byA Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors(1987).[38]He explained that Warlock had been deemed too expensive to portray on the film's budget, but could appear in a sequel,[31][38]and clarified that the Demon Bear would not be the main antagonist of the film, but would appear since the film was "very much inspired" by the comics in which that character is the main villain.[38]Filming also took place in the Massachusetts towns ofMillis,Lynn, andWeymouth,[41]and ended on September 16, 2017.[42]The film's principal photography was described as "stressful" for Boone, who felt "a bit neutered" during the process due to having to tone down the film from his original "full horror" ideas.[31]
Boone and his regular editors Matthew Rundell and Robb Sullivan delivered a cut of the film to Fox that they were happy with,[43][44]and it tested as well as initial screenings ofDeadpooldid. Three days of additional photography were planned to complete the "YA movie" that Boone, Lee, and Fox had agreed to make. However, following the successful release of the filmIt(2017), the studio cut the first trailer forThe New Mutantsto focus on the "scary elements from the film, essentially selling it as a straight-up horror movie". With the positive reception to the preview, Fox decided to make the film more like Boone's original vision rather than completing the version that they had been making during production.[31]
In January 2018, the film's release date was pushed back to February 22, 2019.[45]This allowed it to avoidDeadpool 2(2018), which had just been moved to a date that would have had both films in theaters at the same time in certain markets.[46]It also allowed time for the reshoots the studio required to make the film more in line with Boone's original vision.[31][47][48]When asked about this delay the next month, Williams stated that there had been concerns during filming regarding the short turnaround from the end of photography to the previously set release date, especially with the amount of visual effects still needed to finish the film, so in her opinion the delay was "for the better".[49]The additional photography was scheduled for mid-2018. It was expected to include the addition of several new characters who would appear throughout the film rather than just making cameo appearances.[43][50]
In March 2018, Fox again delayed the film's release, distancing it from the new February 2019 release date forDark Phoenix, rescheduling its release for August 2, 2019.[51]At this point, the studio believed that the reshoots required were more extensive than previously considered, with intentions to reshoot at least half of the film. The intent was to make the film as distinct from the other entries in the series as possible, looking toward the variety ofDeadpoolandLogan(2017).[43]They believed the film would not endure a similar fate toFantastic Four(2015) which went through similar production issues and became a "flop", with the issues not being placed on Boone, allowing him to write and direct the reshoots to complete his original vision.
In addition to adjusting the tone of the film through reshoots, they also planned to change an antagonist subplot in the film. Originally intended to feature the Essex Corporation, which was first teased at the end ofX-Men: Apocalypse, with apost-credits scenefeaturing the reveal ofJon Hammas the villainNathaniel Essex / Mister Sinister,[31]Fox requested the reshoots to include a new post-credits scene introducingAntonio Banderasas Sunspot's father Emmanuel da Costa.[31][52]Kinberg later denied that an actor was ever cast as Mister Sinister when he revealed that the character had been intended to be included in thecanceledGambitfilm.[53]Hamm later revealed that while there were talks to have him play Mr. Sinister, his scene was never filmed.[54]
Reshoots for the film were slated to begin by the end of September 2018, with Kinberg stating: "audiences really embraced the notion of a superhero movie or a comic book movie that was, in its core, a horror film".[55]Following theacquisition of Fox by Disneyin March 2019, it was revealed that the additional photography had still not taken place, nor were they "planned so far". The work was dependent on Boone's involvement,[56][57]and decisions being made to instead release the film on one of the streaming services owned by The Walt Disney Company.[58]A month later atCinemaCon2019, Disney confirmed that the film will be released, but indicated that its release date could be adjusted to better fit within Disney's existing schedule.[59]A month after that, the studio pushed the film's release back to April 3, 2020,[60]and the reshoots were set to take place later in 2019. Kinberg explained that they had take time to reschedule because the creative team was still deciding what portions of the film to reshoot due to the difficulty of reuniting the cast given their busy schedules.[61]
In August 2019, Disney was reported to be unimpressed with the original cut ofThe New Mutants, believing it had "limited box office potential".[62]Additional work was completed, after Disney acquired it, to align the film with Boone's original vision, and test screenings with these changes had been positive. In addition to making the film more horror-tinged, these changes also included removing overt connections to theX-Menfilms.[63]However, the film as released does make reference to the previous entries, with the inclusion of the Essex Corporation connecting the film to the post-credits scene ofApocalypseand toLogan.[64]By December of the same year it was confirmed that work on the film had been taking place, while marketing had been adjusted to align with the style ofMarvel Studios.[65]Boone stated that the latest version of the film followed his original vision.[66]In January 2020, Disney's official fan club websiteD23described the film as a "new addition to theMarvel Cinematic Universe", a statement that was quickly picked up by fans and reporters. Soon after, all mentions of the film were removed from the website, while Disney identified this as an error and stated that the film would not be part of the MCU.[67]
On March 7, 2020, Boone stated that the film was complete.[68]Shortly after, he explained that work on the film had halted when Disney's acquisition of Fox had begun and so no reshoots ever took place on the film, not even standard pickups that had already been scheduled during initial production. At the time, around 75 percent of the film had been edited while much of the film's visual effects were also not finished. By the time the acquisition was completed, Boone had moved on and was about to begin work on a new television series,The Stand. Before he started production on that series, Disney asked Boone if he would return to finish the film.[9]Rundell and Sullivan were committed to working onThe Standat that point and could not continue editingThe New Mutants, so Boone brought on editor Andrew Buckland to help finish the film.[44]
The work required to finish the film when Boone returned involved completing the visual effects and editing alongside co-writer Lee, which took several months. Reshoots for the film could have been scheduled at that point, but Boone found that the three-year wait since principal photography meant that the young cast had aged too much.[9]He also felt it did not make sense to add the post-credit scenes of Banderas since it was unlikely that they would be able to make a sequel now that Disney owned the X-Men rights and was integrating the property into the MCU.[52]Describing returning to the film after so long, Boone said, "we hadn't seen it in a year. We did a bunch of things here and there that we hadn't thought about or noticed a year before." The visual effects that still needed to be finished included Illyana's sorceress abilities, including herSoulswordthat she materializes, as well as her dragon companion Lockheed.[9]Visual effects for the film were provided byDNEG,Method Studios, andMoving Picture Company, with Olivier Dumont serving as VFX supervisor.[69]After the film was completed, Boone reunited the cast for the first official screening in New York City, after which Williams stated, "The movie is exactly the movie we set out to make."[9]
Disney removedThe New Mutantsfrom its release schedule, along with several other films, on March 12, 2020, due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, and was looking to reschedule the film's release to a later 2020 date.[70]On May 4, the film was automatically listed for home media pre-order onAmazonbased on the film's previous April 2020 release date. Amazon took the listing down hours later after it had been widely reported on. At that time, the film was still expected to receive a theatrical release rather than be released straight-to-streaming as other films had been during the pandemic.[71]Shortly after, Disney scheduled the film for release on August 28, 2020.[72]
Nate WalcottandMike Mogiswere confirmed in December 2017 to be composing the score for the film, having worked with Boone on his previous films.[73]In May 2018,Marilyn Mansonannounced that hiscoverof the song "Cry Little Sister"—originally written for the filmThe Lost Boys(1987) byGerard McMahon—which Manson debuted during hisHeaven Upside Downtour, had been recorded specifically for theNew Mutantssoundtrack, despite appearing in an ad in 2018 for the seriesTitansand being released as a single in 2018.[74][75]In February 2020,Mark Snowwas revealed to have composed the score for the final version of the film, though additional music composed by Walcott and Mogis was still set to be used in the soundtrack; "Cry Little Sister" did not appear on the official soundtrack album.[76]
The first trailer for the film was released in October 2017, onFriday the 13th,[77]with a horror focus inspired by the success of the filmIt, which had been released the month before.[31]Sara Vilkomerson ofEntertainment Weeklyfelt that trailer delivered on Boone's promise of a different type ofX-Menfilm and was "creepy". Vilkomerson also noted the trailer's use ofPink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2";[78]the title treatment for the film introduced in the trailer evokes the treatment used for that song.[38]Alex McLevy, writing forThe A.V. Club, also felt that Boone had delivered on his promise of a "straight-up horror film" and said, "Congrats to this creative team for trying something different with the superhero genre."[79]Writing for/Film, Hoai-Tran Bui said the film looked like abottle episodefor theX-Menfranchise and noted that telling a standalone story led to success forDeadpool. Bui also compared the trailer's tone toStranger Things(in which Heaton also stars as Jonathan Byers) and Braga's performance as Reyes toNurse Ratched.[80]Boone, Lee, Braga, Zaga, and Sienkiewicz promoted the film at a 2017Comic Con Experiencepanel, where they also talked about their plans for future films.[20]
A new trailer, incorporating the changes made to the film following Disney's acquisition of Fox, was released on January 6, 2020.[citation needed]Boone sent the trailer to Sienkiewicz in December 2019, and the comic book artist praised it as "phenomenal". He stated that the horror elements of the film were still present in the trailer, but that it now also appeared to have been influenced by the style of Disney's Marvel Studios who he said had appeared to give the latest version of the film "the blessings of Marvel".[65]Aja Romano ofVoxalso compared the horror elements of this trailer toStranger Thingsand felt the film looked like "highly entertaining, if predictable, fun".[81]io9's Charles Pulliam-Moore praised the more comic-accurate superhero abilities included in the new trailer, especially Magik's, and felt that the less superhero-like elements could be what saves the film from being a "flop" likeDark Phoenix.[82]Writing about the trailer forForbes, Scott Mendelson said the film "seems to be pretty similar in content and tone to what was always promised" and discussed its interesting position as "just a movie" now that theX-Menfranchise had ended and futureNew Mutantsfilms were unlikely after Marvel Studios took control of mutant-based films.[83]
Weeks before the film's then-set April 2020 release date, Graeme McMillan ofThe Hollywood Reporterdiscussed several television spots released for the film. He stated that the first two, titled "Awaken" and "Escape", followed the tone and style of the previous trailers, while the third one, "Attitude", presented the film more like a traditional superhero film, focusing on action, quips, and superpowers. McMillan felt this was an abrupt shift in marketing given "Attitude" was released just one week after the other two spots and questioned whether the change in tone was to align the marketing to the film or just an attempt to boost interest in the film by reminding audiences of other popular superhero films.[84]
A panel for the film was held during the virtual 2020Comic-Con@Homeconvention, with Boone and members of the cast. A teaser for the film, to announce the panel, was also released.[85]Ethan Anderton from/Filmfelt Taylor-Joy had "a great moment referencing herself" as Magik in the teaser and felt the footage "doesn't look half-bad", though he could not say he was excited for the film because of its extensive delays. Anderton also questioned if the film would hold its then-set August 28, 2020 release date, given higher profile films likeTenetandMulanhad shifted back into August, and wondered if the Comic-Con panel would announce a new theatrical release date or a move to Disney+.[86]Germain Lussier atio9also felt Disney would use the Comic-Con panel to announce new release plans for the films,[87]but the panel reaffirmed the film's August 28 theatrical release date while acknowledging the film's many delays. The film's opening scene was revealed during the panel, which Sienkiewicz joined to discuss a new poster he had drawn for the film.[88]
The New Mutantswas released in the United States on August 28, 2020.[72]It was originally set to be released on April 13, 2018,[29]before being delayed to February 22, 2019, to avoidDeadpool 2,[51]and then to August 2, 2019, to avoidDark Phoenix.[45]It was delayed to April 3, 2020, by Disney after that studio acquired Fox,[60]and then removed from Disney's schedule in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[70]Disney rescheduled the film for August 28, 2020, two months later.[72]The various delays have led to several online commentators referring to the film as "cursed" and lamenting its bad luck.[70][89][90]Boone and the film's cast acknowledged this curse during the 2020 Comic-Con@Home convention, which included a "cheeky teaser trailer" that recounted the film's release dates and ended with a "Fingers Crossed" note beside the August 28 date.[88]Boone also revealed the various contracts signed for the film guaranteed a theatrical release, preventing it from first being released on eitherDisney+orHulu.[91]
The New Mutantswas released onDVD,Blu-rayandUltra HD Blu-raybyWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainmenton November 17, 2020.[92]
The New Mutantsgrossed $23.9 million in the United States and $25.3 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $49.2 million.[5][6]
Originally tracking to debut to around $20 million in the United States before the COVID-19 pandemic,The New Mutantswas projected to gross $5–10 million from 2,412 theaters in its opening weekend.[93][94]The film made $3.1 million on its first day, including $750,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $7 million, finishing first at the box office. With 62% of theaters in the country open (operating at 25–50% capacity), the audience was 66% male, with 61% being between 18 and 34.[3]In its second weekend, the film fell 59% to $2.9 million, despite adding over 340 theaters, finishing second behind newcomerTenet,[4]then made $2.1 million in its third weekend and $1.6 million in its fourth.[95][96]
Internationally, the film was released day-and-date with the U.S. in 10 countries and made $2.9 million over its first weekend, including $1.1 million in France, $500,000 in Spain, and $400,000 in Taiwan.[97]Expanding to 30 countries in its second weekend, the film made another $4.2 million.[98]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 36% based on 139 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Rendering a list of potentially explosive ingredients mostly inert,The New Mutantsis a franchise spinoff that's less than the sum of its super-powered parts."[99]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[100]
Writing forThe Hollywood Reporter, Jordan Mintzer said, "Generic and, at its best, straining to be heartfelt, director Josh Boone's adaptation of the Marvel spin-off comic series is a Marvel movie spinoff in its own right, making vague references to theX-Menfranchise but attempting to stand on its own. Unfortunately it rarely does, even if the film's trio of young and tough female leads manages to give your typically male-dominated genre something of a feminine twist."[101]Peter Debruge ofVarietysaid, "Despite all the meddling and interference the film reportedly went through,The New Mutantsfeels pretty coherent in the end. What it doesn't achieve is a memorable personality of its own."[102]The Daily Telegraph's Tim Robey gave it 3/5 stars, writing, "Any depth in these roles has been blatantly sacrificed to a brisk, unpretentious 94-minute running time, but Maisie Williams makes the most of what she gets as a Scottish-accented lesbian lycanthrope called Wolfsbane, as if determined to be absolutely no one’s bog-standard love interest."[103]
Amy Nicholson ofThe New York Timeswrote, "Directed in 2017 by Josh Boone...The New Mutantsspent three years on ice before being allowed to escape into the slowest summer season in a century. That's fitting for a film that's all buildup and no bang."[104]The Globe and Mail's Barry Hertz gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, writing, "Instead of funnelling his inspirations into one singular vision that he could call his own, Boone has made a Frankenstein of a franchise movie, a giant elevator pitch that leads directly to the sub-basement of originality."[105]The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey gave it 2/5 stars, writing, "The New Mutantstramples over its own comic book credentials in order to chase after a concept already more convincingly dealt with byThe Chilling Adventures of SabrinaorBuffy the Vampire Slayer".[106]
In the days leading up to the film's release, several major publications, includingRogerEbert.com,IndieWire,The A.V. Club, andThe Boston Globe, refused to review the film, citing Disney's lack ofsocially distancedpress screenings or digital streaming links and noting that it was not safe to attend a traditional public screening due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[107][108]
The New Mutantsreceived a nomination for Best Thriller Poster at the 2018Golden Trailer Awards.[109]The film was nominated for aSaturn Award for Best Comic to Motion Picture Releasein2021.[110]
TheNew Mutantscomics co-creator,Bob McLeod, expressed his disappointment with the film for inaccurately depicting the characters: "I was disappointed when they didn't give Dani braids, although I like Blu Hunt. I was disappointed when Rahne wasn't a redhead with spiky hair, although I adore Maisie Williams. I was disappointed that Sam isn't tall and gawky, although I do like Charlie Heaton. But mainly I was very disappointed that Roberto isn't short and dark-skinned. Yet another example of Hollywood white-washing." He also criticized the film for misspelling his name in the credits as "MacLeod".[111][112]The spelling was corrected for the home media release.[113]Criticism was also directed to Braga, a white Brazilian woman, playing Dr. Cecilia Reyes, a black Puerto Rican character.[114]McLeod further felt that fitting the film into the horror genre was a mistake and that it most likely would have fared better had it been a straightforward origin film, akin to thegraphic novelthat he andChris Claremontcreated together.[115]After his comments went viral, he said he felt bad for Henry Zaga, who plays Sunspot, and told people to calm down and that the movie looked like great fun.[116]
Boone and Lee originally pitched the film to Kinberg as the first in a trilogy.[17]In October 2017, Boone said that the charactersWarlockandKarmawould appear in the sequels.[38]In December, Boone and Lee revealed that they were interested in filming the first sequel inBraziland that Sunspot's father Emmanuel da Costa would play a role in the franchise.[20]Explaining his plans for the sequels, Boone said that he wanted each film in the trilogy to be a different kind of horror movie. The first film is a "'rubber-reality' supernatural horror movie",[38]the second film would have been an alien invasion film featuring Warlock, and the third film would have been anapocalyptic horrorfilm inspired by the 1989 comic book crossover storyline "Inferno".[117]Boone confirmed that the second film would have been set in Brazil and included Antonio Banderas as Emmanuel da Costa. Karma was to be introduced as the villain of the sequel but would have joined the New Mutants by the end of the film alongside Warlock. Boone added that Emmanuel da Costa's connections to theHellfire Clubwould have been explored in the first sequel, and he said the overall tone of that film would still have been inspired by Claremont and Sienkiewicz's run.[52]Boone had wantedSacha Baron Cohento portray Warlock through motion capture and had discussed the role with Cohen during production on the first film.[118]
In March 2019, Disney officially acquired Fox and gained the film rights to several Marvel Comics characters for Marvel Studios, including the New Mutants.[119][120]The Marvel-based films that Fox had been developing were placed "on hold".[121]In March 2020, Boone stated that while it was unlikely that a sequel toThe New Mutantscould be made now that X-Men characters were being integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he still hoped that the film would be successful enough to allow a sequel to be made.[52]That August, Boone confirmed that there were no plans to incorporate the film into the MCU.[122]

The company was a wholly owned subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Companyfrom 2009 until its dissolution in 2023, and was mainly known for consumer products, licensing, and comic books byMarvel Comics, as well as its early forays intofilmsandtelevision series, including those within theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU).
In 2009, the Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment forUS$4 billion;[1]it had been alimited liability company(LLC) since then. For financial reporting purposes, Marvel was primarily reported as part of theDisney Consumer Productssegment ever sinceMarvel Studios' reorganization from Marvel Entertainment intoWalt Disney Studios.[2]
Over the years, Marvel Entertainment entered into several partnerships and negotiations with other companies across a variety of businesses. As of 2025[update], Marvel has film licensing agreements withSony PicturesviaColumbia Pictures(forSpider-Man films) and theme park licensing agreements withIMG Worlds of AdventureandUniversal Destinations & Experiences(for specific Marvel character rights atIslands of Adventure).[3]Aside from their contract with Universal Destinations & Experiences, Marvel's characters and properties have also appeared atDisney Parks.[4]
On March 29, 2023, Marvel Entertainment's remaining units were folded into Disney's other divisions.[5][6]

"It is a mini-Disney in terms of intellectual property," said Perelman. "Disney's got much more highly recognized characters and softer characters, whereas our characters are termed action heroes. But at Marvel we are now in the business of the creation and marketing of characters."[7]
Marvel made aninitial public offeringof 40% of the stock (ticker symbolNYSE:MRV) on July 15, 1991, giving $40 million from the proceeds to Andrews Group, Marvel's then direct parent corporation within MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings.[11][12][13]

Marvel purchased thetrading cardcompanyFleeron July 24, 1992.[11][14][15][16][17]On April 30, 1993, Marvel acquired 46% ofToyBiz, which gave the company the rights to make Marvel toys.[11]The Andrews Group namedAvi Aradof ToyBiz as the president and CEO of theMarvel Filmsdivision.[18]
In 1993 and 1994, Marvel'sholding companies, Marvel Holdings, Inc. and Marvel Parent Holdings, Inc., were formed between Andrews Group and MEG. The companies issued over half a billion dollars in bonds under the direction of Perelman, which was passed up in dividends to Perelman's group of companies.[19]Later on, Marvel andAcclaim Entertainmentteamed up to provide a video game license in the early 1990s, which eventually formed into a joint label,Marvel Softwarein 1994.[20][21]On July 5, 1994, Marvel acquiredPanini Group, an Italian sticker-maker,[22]followed byMalibu Comicson November 3[23][24]andHeroes World Distribution, a regional distributor to comic-book shops, in December. On March 10, 1995, it acquired trading card companySkyBox Internationalwith the acquisition being fully completed later in May.[11][25][26][27][28][29]

In late 1996, Perelman proposed a plan to save Marvel in which the company would merge with Toy Biz after Perelman spent $350 million for the Toy Biz shares that he did not already own. He would then receive newly issued Marvel shares to maintain his 80 percent stake.[11]
Separately, in July 1996, Marvel filed with theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionto raise money to create a private entity calledMarvel Studios.[34]Much of the money to create Marvel Studios came from the sale ofToy Bizstock.[34][35]
On December 27, 1996, the Marvel group of companies filed forChapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[7][11][36][37][38][39][40]At this time,Carl Icahn, an American businessman and investor, began buying Marvel's bonds at 20% of their value and moved to block Perelman's plan.[11]In February 1997, Icahn won the bankruptcy court's approval to take control of the company's stock.[11]Later, in June 1997, Icahn won the right to replace Marvel's board, including Perelman.[11][41]
In December 1997, during the post-bankruptcy reorganization phase, Toy Biz came to an agreement to purchase Marvel from the banks.[7][11]In December 1997, the bankruptcy court appointed a trustee to oversee the company in place of Icahn.[11]In April 1998, while the legal battle continued, the NYSE delisted Marvel stock.[11]

Later, the rights to names like "Spider-Man" were being challenged. Toy Biz hired an attorney to review its license agreement. Los Angeles patent attorneyCarole E. Handlerfound a legal loophole in the licensing of the Marvel name and was successful in reclaiming Marvel Enterprises' movie rights to its character Spider-Man.[43][44][45]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
