It premiered atArcLight Hollywoodon March 7, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 13, 2020.

InLafayette, Indiana, in September 1999,Jeremy Campdeparts forCalvary Chapel CollegeinMurrieta, California. The night of his arrival, he goes to a concert of Canadian Christian band,the Kry, where he meets the lead singer, Jean-Luc LaJoie, who becomes fast friends with Jeremy, who turns to him for musical advice.
After the concert, Jeremy meets Melissa Henning, a fellow student at his school, and friend of Jean-Luc, who loves Melissa, but she does not feel the same. Jeremy and Melissa get to know each other, and quickly begin dating, causing a rift among the three. As a result, Melissa ends her relationship with Jeremy.
Jeremy goes back to his family's home in Indiana for Christmas break. A few days after Christmas, he receives a phone call from Jean-Luc, saying that Melissa is sick, and asks Jeremy to come back to California.
Upon his arrival, Jeremy visits Melissa in the hospital, who tells him that she has been diagnosed with Stage 3C ovarian cancer spread to her liver. She also tells Jeremy that she loves him. He says the same, proposes and Melissa accepts.
During this time, Jeremy begins to make a name for himself as a Christian singer-songwriter. At one point, when Melissa is about to have an MRI. Melissa learns that the cancer has spread to her ovaries, so she needs ahysterectomy. She wakes up to Jeremy after the surgery was supposed to happen, who tells her the surgery was canceled as she is now cancer-free.
Six months later, Jeremy and Melissa marry. Everything seems perfect until after their honeymoon, when she wakes up in pain. Jeremy takes her to the hospital, where they find out her cancer has returned, and that nothing more can be done for her.
As Melissa grows weaker, Jeremy begins to question his faith in God. In the hospital, Jeremy sings a song he wrote ("Walk by Faith") during their honeymoon. Melissa passes shortly after.
Jeremy becomes angry at God, and chooses to abandon his musical career, smashing his guitar until it breaks. Inside the guitar, Jeremy finds a note Melissa left for him to find after her death, telling him that suffering does not damage faith, but strengthens it. Her parting words encourage him to continue writing songs.
Two years later, Jeremy performs a song he wrote after Melissa's death ("I Still Believe") about his suffering, but eventually restored faith. After the concert, he meets a woman named Adrienne, who tells Jeremy that she lost someone close to her, and she was angry at God, and his songs changed her life.
Jeremy promises to share Melissa's story, believing that God will use it to change lives. The credits reveal that Jeremy and Adrienne got married in 2003, and have three children.
The film is the first project of a deal struck between the Erwin Brothers andLionsgateafter the success of their filmI Can Only Imaginein 2018.[6]It is also the first film produced by Kingdom Story Company, afilm studiofounded by theErwin Brothers,Kevin Downes, and Tony Young,[7]and the Erwin Brothers' secondmusic biopicafterI Can Only Imagine.
Jeremy Camp was actively involved in the production of the film,[8]while singer-songwriterBart MillardofMercyMe(whose life story was told in the Erwin Brothers'I Can Only Imagine) acted as an executive producer,[9]along with Camp,Jon Gunn, and others.

Apa, who did his own singing for the film, said he was drawn to the story because "[t]heir love is seriously put to the test in this movie," adding, "it's about journeying through your biggest fears and disappointments and coming out still believing. I believe that anyone, everyone can relate to this film because it's a story about love, loss, and hope."[11]Apa later related that his role inI Still Believeis "the coolest thing I've ever done".[12]
Co-director Andrew Erwin related that he hoped the cast, particularly Apa and Robertson, would attract non-Christians in addition to a Christian audience.[13]

Regarding the film's main theme, Jeremy Camp, on whose life the film is based, said that it "tells my story and shares what God has done amidst all the hard things I went through. It shows hope in the midst of pain."[19]
The film's stars, Apa, Robertson and Twain, also shared their thoughts on the film's themes, with Twain commenting that "[t]his is [about] a love that goes beyond fear, that goes beyond any doubt[.]" Apa said that
it's [about] journeying through your biggest fear and coming out on the other side and still loving God ... I hope people, after seeing the love between Jeremy and Melissa, think, 'I hope that I could one day be in love like that[.][20]
I Still Believe's co-director, Jon Erwin, said in an interview with the Baptist Press that
[the] film grapples with [the question of why God allows suffering.] ... I think we forget so many times that there is a beauty, and a purpose, and a meaning in the difficult things we go through. And that sometimes God uses those things more than He uses the good things that happen to shape us, to mold us and to give us our voice. ... It's a love story as God intended, between these two people and God, and between these two people and each other[.][21]
The original motion picture soundtrack was released digitally byCapitol Recordson March 6, 2020, and included Debney's score, Apa's renditions of Camp's songs "This Man", "I Still Believe", "My Desire", and "Right Here", as well as new versions of "I Still Believe" and "Walk by Faith" performed by Jeremy Camp, and two tracks featuring dialog from the film.[15]

We're enormously proud of the movie that the Erwin Brothers created and are grateful to be able to share it with audiences for their home viewing pleasure."[29]The Erwin brothers added, "As filmmakers, we are heartbroken that we can't shareI Still Believeon a big screen the way we intended. We make movies because we love movies and we stand firmly behind the nation's theater chains, from the largest circuits to the smallest mom and pop indies that have been so dramatically affected by these unprecedented closures. But the safety of guests comes first, and we're proud to have the opportunity to share online a movie whose inspiring message of love, hope and faith is perfect for these uncertain times."[29]

Onreview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes,I Still Believeholds an approval rating of 50% based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10.

In a favorable review, Pete Hammond ofDeadline Hollywoodsaid that "I Still Believedoesn't rewrite any of the rules of this genre, but it does ask the right questions of faith in light of unimaginable tragedy without trying to sugarcoat them. For those who truly want to 'still believe', it should be enough. Fans of Apa also ought to be happy. Cynics should quarantine themselves from this; it's not for you."[36]Megan BashamofWorldalso wrote a positive review for the film, and, while criticizing it for its "melodramatic raging", similarly praised its depiction of faith amidst suffering, saying, "[t]he Erwins are careful to show that God is faithful even when He says 'no.'"[37]Joe Leydon ofVariety, in a positive review for the film, praised Apa's and Robertson's performances and commended the Erwin Brothers' direction, saying that inI Still Believe"they amp the emotional power – subtly at first, then gradually more aggressively – with a 'Love Story'-style scenario that is all the more potent for being based on real-life events."[38]
Frank Scheck ofThe Hollywood Reportercommended the film for dealing with "the difficulty of maintaining faith when tragedy strikes for no apparent reason", although his review was ultimately negative, with him stating as a bottom line that "[t]ears will be jerked, but you'll feel the machinations."[39]Carla Meyer ofThe San Francisco Chronicle, while praising Robertson's acting and her chemistry with Apa, derided the film for the lack of "any character development for Jeremy beyond caretaker and worried partner."[40]Similarly,IndieWirewriter David Ehrlich gave the film a "C−", stating that "[t]he power of the Camps' story is hard to deny, but it would almost be impossible to make it seem more hollow. Maybe if the Erwins depicted people with half the same detail with which they dote upon Jesus,I Still Believewouldn't feel so insufferably forced to those of us who don't.[41]Similarly,TheWrapcontributor Carlos Aguilar, while praising Kristopher Kimlin's cinematography and the "above-average production value", called the film "[s]accharine" and "[f]ormulaic to the core, from the protagonist's short-lived moment of doubt to the epiphany that sets him back on course."[42]

My father [Jerry Twain] went out of his way to raise three daughters that weren't even his. For me to acknowledge another man as my father, a man who was never there for me as a father, who wasn't the one who struggled every day to put food on our table, would have hurt him terribly. We were a family. Step-father, step-brothers, we never used that vocabulary in our home. To have referred to him as my step-father would have been the worst slap across the face to him.[26]
She holds astatus cardand is on the official band membership list of theTemagami First Nation. In 1991 Twain was offered a recording contract in Nashville and applied for immigration status into the United States. At that time, by virtue of her stepfather Jerry Twain being a full-blooded Ojibwe and the rights guaranteed to indigenous Americans in theJay Treaty(1795), she became legally registered as having 50 percent indigenous American blood.[26]
Twain has said that as a child she was told by her mother that her biological father was part Cree, a claim his family denies.[26]Her confirmed ancestry includes Irish and French roots. Through a maternal great-grandmother, she is a descendant of French carpenterZacharie Cloutier.[27]Her Irish maternal grandmother, Eileen Pearce, emigrated fromNewbridge, County Kildare.[28]
She has said she had a difficult childhood. Her parents earned little money, and food was often scarce in their household. She did not confide her situation to school authorities, fearing they might break up the family. Her mother and stepfather's marriage was stormy at times, and from a young age she witnessed violence between them. Her mother struggled with bouts of depression.[29]She eventually convinced her mother to take her and the children and run away to a homeless shelter inToronto;[30]however Sharon returned to Jerry with the children in 1981.
In Timmins, Shania started singing at bars at the age of eight to try to help pay her family's bills; she often earned$20 between midnight and 1 a.m. performing for remaining customers after the bar had finished serving alcohol. Although she expressed a dislike for singing in those bars, she believes that this was her own kind of performing-arts school on the road.[31]She has said of the ordeal, "My deepest passion was music and it helped. There were moments when I thought, 'I hate this.' I hated going into bars and being with drunks. But I loved the music and so I survived."[32]She states that the art of creating, of actually writing songs, "was very different from performing them and became progressively important".[33]
At age 13, Twain was invited to perform on theCBC'sTommy HunterShow. While attendingTimmins High and Vocational School, she was the singer for a local band called Longshot, which covered Top 40 music.[34]In the early 1980s she spent some time working with her step-father'sreforestationbusiness in northern Ontario, which employed some 75 Ojibwe and Cree workers. Although the work was demanding and the pay low, she said,
I loved the feeling of being stranded. I'm not afraid of being in my own environment, being physical, working hard. I was very strong, I walked miles and miles every day and carried heavy loads of trees. You can't shampoo, use soap or deodorant, or makeup, nothing with any scent; you have to bathe and rinse your clothes in the lake. It was a very rugged existence, but I was very creative and I would sit alone in the forest with my dog and a guitar and would just write songs.[35]
Twain graduated from Timmins High in June 1983 eager to expand her musical horizons.[36]After Longshot's demise she was approached by a cover band led byDiane Chasecalled Flirt and toured Ontario with them.[36]She took singing lessons from Toronto-based coach Ian Garrett, often cleaning his house as payment.[37]In the autumn of 1984 her talents were noticed by Toronto DJ Stan Campbell who wrote about her in aCountry Music Newsarticle: "Eilleen possesses a powerful voice with an impressive range. She has the necessary drive, ambition and positive attitude to achieve her goals".[37]Campbell was making an album by Canadian musician (and present-dayCKTBradio personality) Tim Denis at the time and she was featured on the backing vocals of the song "Heavy on the Sunshine".[38][37]Country singer Mary Bailey saw her perform inSudbury, Ontario, saying "I saw this little girl up on stage with a guitar and it absolutely blew me away. She performedWillie Nelson's "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain" andHank Williams' "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry". Her voice reminded me ofTanya Tucker, it had strength and character, a lot of feeling. She's a star, she deserves an opportunity."[39]Bailey later said "She sang a few songs that she had written, and I thought to myself, this kid is like nineteen years old, where does she get this? This is from a person who's lived sixty years".[40]On November 1, 1987, her mother and stepfather died in a car accident approximately 50 kilometres (31 mi) north ofWawa, Ontario.[41]She moved back to Timmins to take care of her younger siblings and took them all toHuntsville, Ontario, where she supported them by earning money performing at the nearbyDeerhurst Resort.[42]
Several years later, when Twain's siblings moved out on their own, she assembled a demo tape of her songs and her Huntsville manager set up a showcase for her to present her material to record executives. She caught the attention of a few labels, includingMercury Nashville Records, who signed her within a few months.[43]During this time, she changed her name to Shania, which was rumoured to be anOjibwaword which means "on my way". However, her biographer, Robin Eggar, writes: "There is a continuing confusion about what 'Shania' means and if indeed it is an Ojibwe word or phrase at all. There is no mispronounced or misheard phrase in either Ojibwe or Cree that comes close to meaning 'on my way.' Yet the legend of her name continues to be repeated in the media to this day."[44]Eggar was mistaken about there being no Ojibwe phrase that "comes close", as "Ani aya'aa", pronounced "Ah-nih Eye-uh-ah", means "someone on the way" in Ojibwe. It is therefore possible that someone with an imperfect knowledge of the Ojibwe language created Shania with the incorrect idea it would mean "she's on the way".[45]
Herself-titled debut albumwas released on April 20, 1993, in North America and garnered her audiences outside Canada. Shortly before its release, she sang backing vocals for other Mercury artists, including onJeff Chance's albumWalk Softly on the Bridges(1992)[46]andSammy Kershaw's albumHaunted Heart(1993).[47]Shania Twainreached No. 67 on the US Country Albums Chart and gained positive reviews from critics. The album failed to sell significant copies upon release, but her future success generated enough interest for the album to be certified platinum in 1999 by theRIAA, denoting sales of over 1 million copies. The album yielded two minor hit singles in the United States with "What Made You Say That" and "Dance with the One That Brought You". The third and final single, "You Lay a Whole Lot of Love on Me", failed to chart. All three singles had accompanying music videos. The album was more successful in Europe, where she won Country Music Television Europe's "Rising Video Star of the Year" award.[43]In her 2011 autobiographyFrom This Moment Onshe expressed displeasure with her debut studio album, revealing that she had very little creative control and was frustrated with being unable to showcase her songwriting abilities. She did, however, co-write one song, "God Ain't Gonna Getcha for That", for the album.[48]
When rock producerRobert John "Mutt" Langeheard Twain's original songs and singing from her debut album, he offered to produce and write songs with her. After many telephone conversations, they met atNashville's Fan Fairin June 1993. Twain and Lange became very close within weeks, culminating in their wedding on December 28, 1993. They co-wrote every song apart from one that featured on her second studio album,The Woman in Me.[43][49]The Woman in Mewas released on February 7, 1995. Of the twelve tracks on the album, eight were released as singles. The album's first single, "Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?" went to No. 11 on theBillboardCountry Chart. This was followed by her first Country Top 10 and No.1 hit single, "Any Man of Mine", which also cracked the Top 40 on theBillboardHot 100. She had further hits from the album, including thetitle trackwhich peaked at No.14 and three additional No.1 hits: "(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!", "You Win My Love", and "No One Needs to Know", which was selected for the original soundtrack for the 1996 filmTwister, a first for Twain. Plus minor country hit "Home Ain't Where His Heart Is (Anymore)" and a re-recorded gospel version of the album track "God Bless the Child" with new lyrics.[43]Meanwhile, in Australia, five of these singles: "The Woman in Me", "I'm Outta Here!", "You Win My Love", "No One Needs to Know" and "God Bless the Child", were remixed for the Australian pop market, with "I'm Outta Here!" becoming her breakthrough hit there, reaching No.5 on the ARIA charts.[50]
As of 2007 the album had sold more than 12 million copies in the United States, beingcertified Diamondby theRIAA.[51]The album was a quick breakthrough and because of this she performed selected international venues and television shows including two CMA Fan Fair performances with Nashville guitaristsRandy Thomas(co-writer of the song "Butterfly Kisses"), andDan Schafer.[52]Mercury Nashville's promotion of the album was based largely upon a series of music videos, which every single from the album had.[53]During this period she made television appearances on shows such as two performances on theLate Show with David Letterman, Blockbuster Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards and the American Music Awards.The Woman in Mewon theGrammy Award for Best Country Album[54]as well as theAcademy of Country Musicaward for Album of the Year;[55]the latter group also awarded her Best New Female Vocalist.[56]
In 1997 Twain released her follow-up album,Come On Over. It established her as a successful crossover singer. Of the sixteen tracks on the album, twelve were released as singles. Following the release of lead singles "Love Gets Me Every Time" and "Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)", which allowed her to make more appearances in theBillboardHot 100, the album started selling. With the release of third single, "You're Still the One", sales skyrocketed. "From This Moment On", "When", "Honey, I'm Home", "That Don't Impress Me Much", "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!", "You've Got a Way", thetitle track, "Rock This Country!", and "I'm Holdin' On to Love (To Save My Life)" are the other nine songs that eventually saw release as singles. With the exception of "I'm Holdin' On to Love", all of the singles had accompanying music videos. "From This Moment On" is a duet with singerBryan Whiteand there was a re-recorded solo pop version, which was used for its music video.[57]
The album peaked at No. 2 on theBillboard200 and stayed on the charts for the next two years, going on to sell 40 million copies worldwide, making it the biggest-selling album of all time by a female musician.[58]She continued to break international boundaries for country music and female crossover artists. It is also the ninth highest-selling album by any type of artist in the US[51]and the top selling country album in history. Songs from the album won four Grammy Awards during this time, includingBest Country SongandBest Female Country Performance(for "You're Still the One" and "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!") for her. Lange won Grammys for "You're Still the One" and "Come On Over".[59]
In 1998 following the pop release of "You're Still the One", theCome On Overalbum was released in a remixed format for the European market as a pop album with less country instrumentation, and gave her the big breakthrough in Europe she and Lange were looking for.Come On Overwent to No. 1 on the UK album charts for 11 weeks. It became the biggest selling album of the year in the UK and a bestseller in other big European markets as well, selling more than one million copies in Germany and nearly 4 million in the UK alone. Although "You're Still The One" and the pop version of "From This Moment On" cracked the Top 10 of the UK charts and "When" had success in the Top 20, the songs that drew European attention to the album were the pop remixed singles of "That Don't Impress Me Much", which reached number 3 in the UK and cracked the Top 10 in Germany, and "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!", which peaked at number 3 in both the UK and France. Additionally, "You've Got a Way" was remixed specifically for inclusion on the soundtrack for the filmNotting Hill. Subsequently, a reissue of the international version of the album was released worldwide, including the US and Europe, containing three of these new remixes. Additionally, the album set the record for the longest ever stay in the Top 20 of theBillboard200, remaining there for 99 weeks.[60]Billboardmagazine declared Shania Twain the most played adult contemporary artist on US radio in 1999.[61]
In 1998, she launched her first major concert tour, aided by her managerJon Landau, a veteran of many large-scale tours withBruce Springsteen. TheCome On Over Tourshows were a success, winning the "Country Tour of the Year" in 1998 and 1999 by Pollstar Concert Industry Awards.[62]In 2000, she was initially scheduled to release a Christmas album, but plans to release one were cancelled later in the year.[63]As of 2004,Come on Overhas sold over 20 million copies in the United States, beingcertified Double Diamondby theRIAA.[64]
After a change in management – QPrime replaced Landau – and a two-year break, along with the birth of their son, Eja (pronounced "Asia") D'Angelo,[65]Twain and Lange returned to the studio.Up!was released on November 19, 2002. On January 26, 2003, she performed in theSuper Bowl XXXVII halftime show. About a year later she kicked off theUp! TourinHamilton, Ontario, Canada on September 25, 2003.Up!was released with three different discs – country/acoustic (green CD), pop/rock (red CD), and world/dance (blue CD).Up!was given four out of five stars byRolling Stonemagazine, and debuted at No.1 on theBillboardalbums chart, selling 874,000 in the first week alone. It remained at the top of the charts for five weeks. Her crossover appeal in the country, pop and dance genres, ledUp!to reach 1 in Germany, 2 in Australia and the Top Five in the UK and France. In Germany,Up!was certified 4× platinum and stayed in the Top 100 for a year and a half. The international music disc was remixed with Indian-style orchestral and percussion parts recorded inMumbai, India. The new versions were produced by Simon andDiamond Duggal, brothers fromBirmingham, England. They were originally invited to contribute parts to the pop version of "I'm Gonna Getcha Good!" which retained the Indian influence.[66]
Her popularity in UK was reflected by numerous appearances on the long-running music showTop of the Pops, performing singles fromCome On Overfrom 1999. In 2002 an entire special show was dedicated to her on sister showTOTP2, in which she herself introduced some past performances of her greatest hits and singles fromUp!.[67]In November 2004 she appeared on the annual BBC charity telethonChildren in Need. During the show, she performed "Up!", and took part in a magic act in which she was sawn in half by magicianScott Penrosein an illusion calledClearly Impossible.[68]
Eight of the tracks were released as singles in various markets. The first single from the album, "I'm Gonna Getcha Good!" became a top 10 country hit in the US, after debuting at No. 24 after only five days of airplay; but only made the Top 40 on the pop charts. The pop version hit 4 in the UK. In Australia, Germany and France, the song reached the Top 15 in each case. The follow-up single was the title track, which reached the Top 15 in the US country charts but only reached 63 on the pop charts. The second European single, and third single overall, became the mid-tempo song "Ka-Ching!" (which was never released as a single in North America) with lyrics where she was criticizing unchecked consumerism. The song eventually became another hit in the European markets, reaching 1 in Germany and Austria and other European countries, the UK Top 10 and the Top 15 in France.
The fourth single from the album was the most successful in the US, the romantic ballad "Forever and for Always". It was released in April 2003 and peaked at 4 on the country chart, 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart and 20 on theBillboardHot 100. "Forever and For Always" reached the Top 10 in the UK and Germany. The other four singles from the album were "Thank You Baby! (For Makin' Someday Come So Soon)", "She's Not Just a Pretty Face", "When You Kiss Me" and "It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing". All eight singles had accompanying music videos. The title track "Up!", and "When You Kiss Me" saw release in limited edition to European countries, such as Germany, in early 2004. By January 2008,Up!had sold 5.5 million copies in the US and was certified as 11× platinum (Diamond) by theRIAA.[51]This made her the only female artist in history to have three consecutive albumscertified Diamondby theRIAA.[69]

Twain possesses acontraltovocal range.[135][136][137][138][139][140][141]In 1996,Newsweekdefended her from detractors who attributed her refusal to tour at the time to her inability to replicate her studio singing live, describing it as "a warm, languid alto sweetened with a wisp of bedroom allure".[142]Admitting that her singing voice is not as strong as it was prior to herLyme diseasediagnosis, she had to learn how to navigate her new voice in order to continue performing.[143]Prior to her diagnosis, several physicians with whom she consulted throughout the years primarily attribute the loss of her voice to emotional stress, from which she has since recovered after experimenting with various relaxation techniques and devoting a lot of time tovocal warmups.[144]In 2018 she underwentlaryngoplastyto have Gore-Tex stabilizers implanted in her throat to reduce the workload on her vocal muscles.[144][145]

Johnsonsaid her songs "range from domestic-bliss ballads to sassy rockers that taunt and tease."[147]Alanna Nash ofAARPobserved that Twain craftedThe Woman in Mearound "hooky melodies and clever wordplay" from her point of view.[144][146]During the 1990s record executives feared her lyrics were too "male-threatening";[143]bothThe Woman in MeandCome On Overcontain feminist and anti-infidelity themes.[148]Although she has become synonymous with singing songs about female empowerment that are "full of attitude", her catalogue also consists of love songs.[149]She believes female singers are often misunderstood for expressing "feminist views" or standing up for themselves, about which she often sings, explaining, "that doesn't mean that we don't love the men in our lives, and that we don't need the men in our lives."[150]She tends to isolate herself when writing songs to avoid distractions, believing she is most productive in this manner.[148]She claims to adapt melancholy experiences into happy songs.[148]Nowwas the first album she wrote without Lange's involvement, identifying the procedure as a very important songwriting experience because "I needed to do it alone, to start ideas and finish them without relying on anybody else's opinion and direction."[148]Drawing from raw feelings of pain,[144]she also used the album to process the demise of their relationship.[148]
Her primary musical genre is considered to becountry pop,[149]withAllMusiccriticStephen Thomas Erlewinedeclaring that she "Skillfully fus[ed] mainstream,AOR rockproduction with country-pop".[151]Upis considered to be her most straightforward pop album to-date.[148]She maintains that she did not dress provocatively for fame, attention or "shock value" but simply because she enjoys her midriff, claiming to have no regrets about her past outfits.[152]She defends contemporary pop stars who dress provocatively, explaining, "I don't think it's too sexy now ...The boundaries are really up to the individual. And then it's up to the viewer whether they like it or not."[152]She citesKaren Carpenter,[135]Dolly Parton,Mickey Guyton,Taylor Swift,The Chicks,Wynonna Judd, andKelsea Ballerinias some of the female country artists who inspire her.[153]She has also expressed admiration for country singersLoretta Lynn,Patsy Cline,Tammy Wynette,Reba McEntireandLeAnn Rimes.[150]
Despite her success, Twain has been a divisive figure within country music among purists who initially did not take kindly to her "genre-blending".[154]According to biographer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, most critics accused her of "diluting country with bland, anthemic hard rock techniques and shamelessly selling her records with sexy videos."[151]Some country music critics dismissed her music as not being country enough, which some fans theorize resulted in her breakthrough albumThe Woman in Mebeing snubbed at the 1995 Country Music Awards, despite its widespread success.[135]Similar toGarth Brooksbefore her, she was initially branded an interloper whose modern production, presentation and songwriting "disrupt[ed] the genre's status quo".[155]During the 1990s she often received backlash for her unconventionally liberated appearance as a country music singer.[143][152]Despite the breakthrough success ofThe Woman in Me, early detractors did not take her seriously as an artist, with several music journalists questioning her lyrics, the "manufactured" production of her albums, and her singing ability.[156]Such critics concurred that she had little to offer apart from her sex appeal and music videos,[156]often focusing on her physical appearance instead of her music.[154][157]Early in her career she found herself at odds with the conservative opinions of the country music industry at the time due to her assertive personality and proclivity for wearing revealing outfits that exposed hermidriff.[148][152][144]She was constantly deprecated for baring her midriff to the point where critics nicknamed it "The most famous midriff in Nashville",[154]whileCMTbanned the music video for her debut single "What Made You Say That".[156][158]The Independent's Roisin O'Connor believes "Nashville hadn't seen anything like Twain [before] – aleopard print-loving, midriff-exposing artist determined to be an international star."[148]According to Kristin M. Hall of theAssociated Press, since Twain had not yet begun touring, she used music videos to broaden her audience.[159]Similarly, Erlewine considers her to be "the first country artist to fully exploit MTV's style" by cultivating "a sexy, video-oriented image ... that appealed" to both country and pop audiences, largely without touring.[151]
Her record label cautioned her that both men and women would dislike her independence and sexual expressiveness, respectively, but she did not believe them.[148]Record executives warned her that women would feel threatened by her "dressing too sexy".[143]Refusing "to conform to a single archetype of femininity", she recalled that she used music to communicate with like-minded women by alternating between heartbroken, comedic, vengeful, empowered, self-deprecating and lustful personas "all on the same record."[148]Country rock musicianSteve Earlefamously labelled her "the world's highest-paidlap-dancer."[160]Despite these criticisms her music has largely been embraced by fans.[151][154]In a 2015 profile on Twain,Maclean'sSonya Bell theorized that Twain's early critics would be shocked by her continued success,[156]whileAmerican Songwriter's Joe Vitagliano considers her a testament that "critics and the 'industry' aren't quite the 'be-all, end-all' that they think they are".[154]Sarah Koo ofEntertainment Tonight Canadawrote that, in hindsight, Twain's image throughout the 1990s seems tame in comparison to the revealing outfits of artists who have since succeeded her.[152]
At one point she was considered to be among the biggest music stars in the world.[160]Journalist Brian D. Johnson wrote that, despite hergirl next doorimage, Twain "has the sort of star power that people expect from royalty", which he attributes to her Cinderella-esque life story.[147]The Guardian'sSimon Hattenstonedescribed her as "sexy, empowering and funny. This was a woman who knew what she wanted – men, action, dancing, control."[145]Calling her equally country, pop and rock star, Hattenstone went on to write that Twain is "fancied by the straight boys, admired by the straight girls, adored by gay men as a camp icon and loved by lesbians who read what they wanted into Man! I Feel Like a Woman!."[145]Claiming her stint hosting the 2003 Juno Awards was noticeably void of diva behaviour despite persistent rumours of outrageous antics and demands at the time, Brad Wheeler ofThe Globe and Maildescribed her as "an international icon and Canada's sweetheart", a sentiment with which Juno Awards producerJohn Bruntonagreed.[160]Instead Twain relied on her own security, band, production team and assistants.[160]
BBC Onlinedescribed her as "the real Queen of Pop", citing her influence on subsequent successful female artists such asMeghan Trainor,Britney Spears,Taylor SwiftandHaim.[161]As one of country music's first crossover stars,[145]the website claims her success as a country-pop crossover artist demonstrates that "she was doing the Taylor Swift thing before Taylor Swift even arrived."[161]Justin Chandler ofCBCcredited her with making "country-pop crossover its own genre" and "paving the way for artists sitting atop those same charts every year since."[162]Her record-breaking albumThe Woman In Meis credited as the one that permanently changed country music as a whole.[163]
Twain's success in the music industry has earned her the honorific nickname the "Queen of Country Pop".[164][150]By 1998Maclean'shad named her "the reigning queen of country music".[147]American Songwritercontributor Joe Vitagliano named her one of the greatest artists of our time.[154]The New York Timesmusic criticJon Caramanicanamed her "Country's Crossover Queen", writing that during her prime she "was both a pop centrist and a country rebel, and many of the aesthetic moves she pioneered ended up, following a period of some resistance, as central to the sound of Nashville."[165]In a ranking of Twain's best songs,Rolling Stonestated that her catalogue of music "ha[s] come to define an era in country music and paved the way for other genre-bending artists that followed."[166]According to Kristin M. Hall of theAssociated PressTwain's global success "changed country music for years to come."[159]Nash credits her work onCome On Overwith helping to redefine the future of country music.[144]NPR's Jewly Hight wrote that, despite initial derision, Twain eventually "redefin[ed] what country superstardom looked, sounded and behaved like", ultimately influencing a generation of country artists "in making flashier music videos, beefing up their backbeats and staging shows with the energy and theatricality ofarena rock."[155]
Taylor Swiftcredits Twain for her own pop crossover.[167]Swift has cited her as one of her most prominent musical influences.[150]Carrie Underwoodstates that Twain "paved the way for a lot of us."[163]Underwood believes all similar artists were influenced by Twain, whether or not they realize it.[159]She has been cited as a major influence among Canadian country music artists such asTenille Arts,Jess Moskaluke,Dean Brody,Lindi OrtegaandBrett Kissel.[162]RapperPost Maloneand singerRihannahave cited her as an inspiration, with the former calling her his childhood crush.[148][168][169]She covered Malone's song "Rockstar" live during theAmerican Music Awards.[168]She has expressed interest in collaborating with Malone, claiming to have written a song for the two of them in 2019.[170]Singer-songwriter and actorHarry Styleshas mentioned her as his biggest influence both "musically and in fashion".[171]Her bold fashion statements also inspired multiple artists.Harry Stylesrevealed in an interview withEntertainment Tonightthat in "I think, both music and fashion," his "main influence was probably Shania Twain."[172]Halseycited her as one of the artists she was inspired by in her music video "You Should Be Sad".[173]
In January 2005, Twain joined Scentstories byFebrezeto create a limited edition scent disc with the proceeds going to Feeding America, formerly America's Second Harvest.[174]In late 2005 she partnered withCotyto produce her namesake fragrance "Shania" by Stetson. A second fragrance was released in September 2007 called "Shania Starlight".[175]On January 1, 2010, she carried theOlympic Torchthrough her hometown as part of the2010 Winter Olympics torch relay.[176]
Twain met producerRobert John "Mutt" Langeafter he heard her original songs and singing from her debut album; he offered to produce and write songs with her. Having spoken on the phone for many months, they met atNashville's Fan Fairin June 1993 and became close. They were married on December 28, 1993, and had a son, Eja (pronounced "Asia"), on August 12, 2001.[177]On May 15, 2008, it was announced that they were separating after Lange had an affair with Twain's best friend, Marie-Anne Thiébaud.[72][73][178][179]Their divorce was finalized on June 9, 2010.[180]On December 20, 2010, it was reported that Twain was engaged to SwissNestléexecutive Frédéric Thiébaud, Marie-Anne's former husband.[181][182][183]They were married on January 1, 2011, inRincón, Puerto Rico.[184][185]
She is a vegetarian[186][187]and a devotee ofSant Mat, an Eastern spiritual philosophy.[188]In 2010 she created Shania Kids Can, a charity designed to address the needs of neglected children who are frequently overlooked by social assistance programs.[189]Her autobiography,From This Moment On, was published on March 27, 2011.[190]She is a long-time resident ofCorseaux, Switzerland,[191]where her son was born, and she also owns properties in Las Vegas and the Bahamas.[192][193]When performing in North America, she will sometimes wear the jersey of the localNational Hockey Leagueteam.[194]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
