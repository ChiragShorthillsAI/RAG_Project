Directed byKenneth Branagh, from a screenplay co-written byConor McPhersonandHamish McColl, the film stars Ferdia Shaw,Lara McDonnell,Josh Gad,Tamara Smart,Nonso Anozie,Colin Farrell, andJudi Dench. It details the adventures ofArtemis Fowl II, a twelve-year-old Irish prodigy who teams up withhis faithful servant, as well asa dwarfanda fairy, to rescue his father, Artemis Fowl I, who has been kidnapped byanother fairylooking to reclaim an item theFowl familyhas stolen.
Originally intended to be launched as a franchise byMiramaxin 2001, the film languished indevelopment hellwith several writers and directors attached untilWalt Disney Picturesrevived the project in 2013. Branagh was hired in 2015 and filming began in 2018.
Artemis Fowl's intended 2019 theatrical release was delayed to 2020, and then cancelled in response to theCOVID-19 pandemic. Instead, it was released digitally worldwide exclusively onDisney+on June 12, 2020. The film received negative reviews from critics, who criticized the film's plot, dialogue, characters, visual effects, and changes made to the source material.[3]
On the coast of Ireland, a media frenzy descends on Fowl Manor, where a stolen collection of world-famousrelicsis linked to wealthy businessman, Artemis Fowl I. Arrested at the manor,Mulch Diggumsis interrogated byBritish intelligenceand claims that his employer has stolen the powerful "Aculos". Offering to prove the existence of magic, Diggums tells the story ofArtemis Fowl Jr.
Three days earlier, Artemis Jr., a twelve-year-old genius, lives at Fowl Manor with his widowed father Artemis Sr., who goes missing from his boat, accused of the theft of several pricelessartifactsfound aboard. Artemis Jr. receives a call from a hooded figure. Holding his father captive, the hooded figure gives Artemis three days to recover the Aculos, which Artemis Sr. has stolen and hidden.Domovoi "Dom" Butler, Artemis' bodyguard, shows him a hidden library where generations of Fowls have catalogued proof of the existence of magical creatures.
Deep underground inside the Earth'scoreis the Haven City – home to a civilization of fairies – Mulch, an oversized dwarf thief, encounters Lower Elements Police reconnaissance (LEPrecon) officerHolly Shortas he is taken to prison. CommanderJulius Rootdispatches the LEPrecon force to search for the Aculos, the fairies' greatest resource which makes anyone teleport through worlds across universe and biggest source of heat and light energy to the fairies.Foaly, LEPrecon's centaur technical advisor, discovers an unauthorized creature has reached the surface. Holly is sent to investigate, despite the fact that her father, Beechwood Short, stole the Aculos and was killed. InMartina Franca, Italy, Holly intervenes as a rogue troll attacks a human wedding party. Using a "time freeze", LEPrecon subdues the troll and wipes the humans' memories.
Dom's twelve-year-old nieceJulietarrives at the manor. From his father's journal, Artemis learns that Beechwood brought the Aculos to Artemis Sr. to keep it from the hooded figure, revealed to beOpal Koboi, a powerful fairy warlord and once a ruthless dictator of Haven City who is now planning to wipe out humankind and establish fairy rule upon all the worlds. Artemis sends Dom to stakeout theHill of Tara. Holly, determined to clear her father's name, disobeys orders and flies to the Hill of Tara, where she finds Beechwood's ID tag, but is captured by Dom and imprisoned inside the manor.
Root and an army of LEPrecon officers seal Fowl Manor in a time freeze, but Artemis and Dom fight them off using Holly's equipment. Artemis demands the Aculos in exchange for Holly's release, forbidding fairies to enter his home while he is alive. Bound by fairy rules, Root retrieves Mulch from prison, offering him a reduced sentence to infiltrate Fowl Manor. Mulch tunnels inside and breaks into Artemis Sr.'s safe, finding the Aculos, while Artemis frees Holly and asks for her help. Lieutenant Briar Cudgeon, a spy for Koboi, seizes command of LEPrecon and releases the captured troll into the house, jamming all magic inside.
Mulch swallows the Aculos as Artemis, Holly, Juliet, and Dom evade the troll, which is later killed by Dom. After killing it, Dom is mortally wounded. Against orders, Holly's fellow officers unblock her magic, and she revives Dom. Mulch and the LEPrecon army escape as the time freeze collapses. Left with the Aculos, Artemis refuses to give it to Koboi, and Holly agrees to use it to rescue Artemis' father. As Koboi attempts to kill Artemis Sr., Holly summons him to Fowl Manor.
Artemis Sr. tells Holly that her father gave his life to protect the Aculos, giving her a list of Koboi's accomplices. Holly returns the Aculos to Haven City, where Root, back in command, directs her to investigate every name on the list. Artemis calls Koboi and promises that after destroying her associates, he will come after her and restore the balance of the universe. Mulch'sinterrogatoroffers him freedom in exchange for help capturing Artemis Sr., but Mulch reveals that Artemis arranged his arrest to prove the incident to the authorities, and confirms the existence of magic on camera. As the interrogator calls for backup, the Fowls' helicopter rescues Mulch and, joined by Holly, they fly off for their next mission to hunt down Koboi's associates.

Miramax Films(owned byThe Walt Disney Companyat the time) purchased the film rights in conjunction withTribeca Productionsin 2000, before the novel was published.[4][5]Plans for a film adaptation of the series were first announced in 2001, withLawrence Gutermansigned to direct, Jeff Stockwell to write, andRobert De NiroandJane Rosenthalas producers.[5][6][7][8]In 2003,Eoin Colferstated that a screenplay had been finalized and that casting was due to start the same year but expressed skepticism over whether or not this would come to pass.[9]The film remained indevelopment hell,[5]in part because of disputes over the rights betweenThe Walt Disney CompanyandHarveyandBob Weinstein, who were leaving Miramax Films.[10]During this time,Jim Sheridan, his daughter Naomi Sheridan, and Colfer co-wrote anon-commissioned screenplay,[4]and it was reported in 2011 that Jim Sheridan was negotiating to direct and had met withSaoirse Ronanto possibly star in the film.[11][12]
In July 2013,Walt Disney Picturesannounced that they would produce anArtemis Fowlfilm withThe Weinstein Company, covering the events of the first and second novels of the series, with the screenplay written byMichael Goldenberg.[13]
On September 1, 2015,Varietyreported thatKenneth Branaghhad been hired to direct the film for Disney, with Irish playwrightConor McPhersonas screenwriter andHarvey Weinstein,Judy Hofflund, and Branagh as producers.[14]On September 12, 2017, Disney announced that the film adaptation would be released on August 9, 2019.[15]The following month, Disney removed Weinstein as producer of the film and terminated its production partnership withThe Weinstein Companyfollowing the exposure ofWeinstein's criminal sexual misconduct.[16]
On September 18, 2017, it was reported thatJudi Denchwas in talks for an undisclosed role.[17]On December 20, 2017, it was announced that Irish newcomer and grandson ofRobert Shaw, Ferdia Shaw, had been cast as Artemis Fowl II, alongside Dench as Commander Root,Josh Gadas Mulch Diggums,Lara McDonnellas Captain Holly Short, andNonso Anozieas Butler.[18][19]Colin Farrellwas added to the cast as Artemis Fowl I duringreshoots, and his involvement was revealed through the second trailer in March 2020.[20]
McDonnell's casting as Short brought accusations ofwhitewashing, given the character in the book series is described as having dark nut-brown skin of a coffee complexion.[21][22]Similarly, Anozie's casting as Butler was criticized, as the books describe him as a Eurasian who can pass as Japanese and Russian; and because the character's physical description of terrifying anyone in his presence, combined with his backstory of his family having served theFowl familyfor centuries, was seen with Anozie's casting as embodying severalstereotypes of African Americansand Africans, in particular the "scary black man" and "black servant" tropes.[23][24]
AuthorEoin Colferfilmed acameo appearanceas anextra. Describing his one scene, filmed in Northern Ireland, Colfer said, "I walked across a field with a lot of other people. It wasn't too taxing – although I did manage to get it wrong a few times. The only direction they gave was: 'Walk across the field and don't look at the camera.' I must have looked at the camera about 20 times. I have a new respect for actors."[25]
Principal photography commenced on March 12, 2018. The film was shot in theRepublic of Ireland,Northern Ireland, England,Scotland, Italy, andVietnam.[26]Fowl Manor was built atLongcross Studiosin Surrey and was designed to last for the production of sequels, but had been torn down by May 2020.[27]Many changes were made from the source material, which Colfer has stated that he supports.[28]
The film was originally scheduled for a theatrical release on August 9, 2019, byWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. In May 2019, the film was pushed back to May 29, 2020.[29]Later however, due to theimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema, the film's theatrical release was cancelled and it was exclusively released onDisney+on June 12, 2020.[30]Vulturewrote that "given Disney's continuing commitment to theatrical openings for its megabudget event films... it's impossible to readArtemis Fowl's Disney+ debut as anything but an abandonment of faith."[5]In November 2020,Varietyreported the film was the 18th-most watched straight-to-streaming title of 2020 up to that point.[31]
The film was removed from Disney+ on May 26, 2023 as part of a cost-cutting measure on Disney's streaming platforms.[32]It was released on digital retail platforms on September 26, 2023.[33]
According to ScreenEngine/ASI,Artemis Fowlwas the 18th-most-watched straight-to-streaming title of 2020, as of November 2020.[31][34]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 8% based on 177 reviews, and an average rating of 3.7/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "A would-be franchise-starter that will anger fans of the source material and leave newcomers befuddled,Artemis Fowlis frustratingly flightless."[35]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100 based on 33 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[36]
Comic Book Resourcessummarized that critics were generally "blasting the film for not being entertaining enough and [for] poor execution."[37]Kate Erbland ofIndieWiregave the film a "D+" and noted that it "lacks an effective star, good effects, general coherency, and any sense of actual magic."[38]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote that the film "becomes a wearying slog, with too little reason to invest in the bland characters amid all the chaos."[39]Peter Debruge ofVarietycalled the film "tortuously long at just 93 minutes" and "downright awful".[40]Scott Mendelssohn ofForbeswrote that the film "fails on a fundamental level of 'Is this movie fun?' and 'Do I want to spend any more time with these characters?'" and described it as "one of the worstYAfantasy movies ever".[41]Robbie CollinofThe Daily Telegraphgave the film 1/5 stars, writing: "Lots of things happen but nothing unfolds. It's like watching a feature-length trailer for a film that doesn't exist."[42]Barry Hertz ofThe Globe and Mailgave the film 1.5/4 stars, saying that it was "a confusing, muddled, sloppy mess of bad intentions and worse execution."[43]Peter BradshawofThe Guardiangave the film 2/5 stars, writing: "Images and characters bounce around like shapes on a screensaver and only McDonnell and Gad's performances have any fizz. This is a YA-franchise by numbers."[44]
Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave a positive review of 3 out of 4 stars, writing that the film "does a marvelous job of capturing the decidedly Irish tone of the adventure" and features a "wonderful and diverse collection of characters."[45]Mark Kermodesaid that it was: "A fun, fleeting, rather flimsy romp... it doesn't have classic qualities, but it works if you take it for what it is: a 95-minute supernatural fantasy".[46]Brian Lowry ofCNNwrote: "Artemis Fowlisn't an unqualified good egg, but it's perfectly adequate... Adapted from popular books, this busy, hectic film races to build an ornate world, and winds up feeling like it's jumping to "franchise" status before getting on its cinematic feet."[47]
Steve Rose ofThe Guardiancriticized the film's "color-blind" casting. He said that the casting of Butler, who was Eurasian in the books, was "not a great look casting the guy whose family has served the white Fowl dynasty for generations as a black man", and also criticized Holly Short being played by a white actress in the film despite being described as "nut brown" in the books.[48]
Ferdia Shaw received a nomination for Best Performance in a Streaming Film – Teen Actor at the 2021Young Artist Awards.[49]ColliderincludedArtemis Fowlin their "Best Original Movies on Disney Plus" list.[50]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle. Its first film appearance was with the release ofStrange World.[60]The logo received widespread praise from critics and audiences and won Gold in the "Theatrical | Film: Design" medium at the 2023Clio Entertainment Awardsin November 2023. The standard version of the logo premiered theatrically withThe Beach Boys.[61]

Conor McPherson(born 6 August 1971) is an Irish playwright, screenwriter and director of stage and film. In recognition of his contribution to world theatre, McPherson was awarded an honorary doctorate of literature in June 2013 by University College Dublin.[1]
McPherson was born inDublin.[2]He was educated atUniversity College Dublinand began writing his first plays there as a member ofUCD Dramsoc, the college's dramatic society, and went on to foundFly by Night Theatre Companywhich produced several of his plays. He is considered one of the best contemporary Irish playwrights; his plays have attracted good reviews, and have been performed internationally (notably in the West End and on Broadway).
The Weiropened at the Royal Court before transferring to the West End and Broadway. It won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play for 1999.
In the same year he was one of the recipients of the VEurope Prize Theatrical Realitiesawarded to theRoyal Court Theatre[3](withSarah Kane,Mark Ravenhill,Jez Butterworth,Martin McDonagh).[4]
His 2001 play,Port Authoritytells of three interwoven lives. The play was first produced by theGate Theatreof Dublin but premiered at theNew Ambassadors Theatrein London in February 2001, before moving to the Gate Theatre in April of that year. The production was directed by McPherson himself. New York'sAtlantic Theater Companystaged a production of the play in the spring of 2008, starring Brian d'Arcy James, and Tony Award winners John Gallagher Jr. and Jim Norton.The New York Timescritic Ben Brantley said, "I found myself holding on to what these actors had to say as if I were a five-year-old at bedtime being introduced toThe Arabian Nights."
McPherson also directed his play,Dublin Carol, at the Atlantic Theater Company, New York, in 2003.
His 2004 playShining Cityopened at the Royal Court and promptedThe Daily Telegraphto describe him as "the finest dramatist of his generation".[5]A meditation on regret, guilt and confusion, the play is set entirely within the Dublin offices of a psychiatrist who himself has psychological secrets. Whilst much of the play takes the form ofmonologuesdelivered by a patient, the everyday stories and subtle poignancy and humour make it a riveting experience. It subsequently opened on Broadway in 2006 and was nominated for two Tony Awards, including Best Play.
In September 2006, to great critical acclaim, McPherson made hisNational Theatredebut as both author and director withThe Seafarerat theCottesloe auditorium, starringKarl JohnsonandJim Norton, withRon Cookas their poker-playing, Mephistophelean guest.

In 1968, she was offered the role of Sally Bowles in the musicalCabaret. AsSheridan Morleylater reported: "At first she thought they were joking. She had never done a musical and she has an unusual croaky voice which sounds as if she has a permanent cold.

The title song, in particular, is projected with great feeling."

Nunn's acclaimed production ofMacbethwas first staged with aminimalistdesign atThe Other Placetheatre in Stratford. Its small round stage focused attention on thepsychologicaldynamics of the characters, and bothIan McKellenin the title role, and Dench, received exceptionally favourable notices. "If this is not great acting I don't know what is", wroteMichael BillingtoninThe Guardian. "It will astonish me if the performance is matched by any in this actress's generation", commentedJ. C. TrewininThe Lady. The production transferred to London, opening at theDonmar Warehousein September 1977, and was adapted for television, later released on VHS and DVD.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
