Alone(released in the UK asFinal Days) is a 2020 Americanhorror filmdirected by Johnny Martin and starringTyler PoseyandDonald Sutherland.[1]The film follows a young man who barricades himself inside his apartment during a zombie apocalypse.[2]The film was released on October 16, 2020.
One morning, a young man named Aidan awakens from a tryst with a random woman. A violent outbreak soon starts to happen outside of his apartment; everyone is being attacked by infected people called Screamers. Neighbor Brandon enters Aidan's apartment after being attacked by his roommate. Aidan threatens Brandon with a kitchen knife to leave after noticing a wound in the back of his neck. Later, Brandon begins to turn, but Aidan gets him out of his apartment before the change is complete.
On the news, Aidan learns that the virus is transferred by bite and scratching. The symptoms of being infected include bleeding eyes, rage,cannibalism, inhuman screaming, and repeating the last words said before turning. The Screamers are aware of what they are doing but cannot stop themselves. Their repeated use of their last words are an attempt to plead for someone to stop them. Aidan tries contacting his family, but the signal is not working on his phone. He can receive the text messages his father sends him, which inform Aidan that his sister got away, but is out of contact. Aidan's parents are trying to reach him but are having trouble with the outbreak. The last message from Aidan's father instructs Aidan to 'Stay Alive' and to not leave his home until they arrive.
Aidan follows his father's orders and isolates himself in the apartment. Over time he tallies the days that pass on his bathroom mirror, keeps video logs on his laptop, and tries to keep himself entertained. Eventually, he begins to run out of food, the water in his building is cut off, and he begins tohallucinateabout his parents. A Screamer eventually breaks into his home using the air ducts connecting the rooms. He fights the Screamer off with a baseball bat and dumps the body off his balcony while sealing the vent the Screamer crashed through.
He later learns through a voicemail from his mother that his parents died while hiding from Screamers. Distraught, Aidan attempts suicide. The moment he readies to hang himself, however, he sees a woman on a balcony across from his; she is a normal human woman. Having found renewed hope, he gives up his suicide attempt. He contacts her the next morning using premade cue cards and learns that her name is Eva. The two strike up a friendship, with Aidan offering his reserved bottled water for her. He later gets Brandon's keys and grabs the remaining food and rock climbing gear to help Eva, even finding radios for them to communicate.
The two decide for Eva to escape to Aidan's room after a horde of Screamers enters her apartment. Aidan first travels through the air ducts to find more supplies for them to wait it out. Aidan eventually enters a room stocked with food. Eva warns him to leave as the room is barricaded with no one inside, signaling that it may be a trap. Aidan then finds Edward, an elderly survivor who entered the room before Aidan after the original tenant killed himself. Edward hits Aidan with his bat while the latter's guard is down.
Edward ties Aidan up in the bedroom to be a sacrifice for his wife, who has turned. Aidan is saved when Eva calls the radio, providing a distraction that allows him to escape and feed Edward to his wife. He grabs his belongings and runs to his room, drops from his balcony to the ground using a makeshift rope of bed sheets, fights off Screamers, and reaches Eva. They both fight to return to Aidan's apartment, with Eva entering the room first while Aidan fights off a Screamer. He returns covered in blood but believes that he has been infected when a mark on his shirt is revealed. He goes to jump to his death so that he will not turn and kill Eva, who pleads for him not to leave her. After removing his shirt they are both overjoyed to see that there is no bite and Aidan will not turn. They run to Aidan's door to hold the refrigerator back against it, stopping the Screamers from entering. They promise to survive together until the end.
The film was released via video-on-demand on October 16, 2020, and on DVD and Blu-ray on October 20, 2020.[4][6]

The long list of Sutherland's roles and accomplishments shows a man who understood emotion well. But it's this marriage of suspicion and empathy, human feeling and the fear of humanity gone wrong, that secured his place in acting history and made him an uncommon kind of star. He didn't disappear into a role, not exactly; he was too distinctive for that. More often, the role disappeared into him, and the result was something unforgettable".
Helen Mirrennamed Sutherland as "one of the smartest actors I ever worked with. He had a wonderful enquiring brain and a great knowledge of a wide variety of subjects. He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity, and with seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became."[156]David Oyelowo, who worked with Sutherland on what became his final performance inLawmen: Bass Reeves,stated that "Given the iconic status he rightly achieved, having a front row seat to Donald Sutherland's last onscreen performance was both a privilege and clear evidence to me of his deep passion for the craft of acting. The glint in his eye was that of an inquisitive, hungry artist still on the hunt for the truth. Seeing that glint, up close, in the eyes of a legend was something to behold."[157]Jane Fonda, who worked with Sutherland on the 1971 filmKlute, wrote: "Donald was a brilliant actor and a complex man who shared quite a few adventures with me, such as theFTA Show, an anti-Vietnam war tour that performed for 60,000 active duty soldiers, sailors, and marines in Hawaii, Okinawa, the Philippines, and Japan in 1971. I am heartbroken."[158]
Sutherland'sBBCobituary says that the "late Donald Sutherland cast a literal and figurative shadow over his industry for almost 50 years".[159]The Guardian'sPeter Bradshawwrote that "Sutherland was an utterly unique actor and irreplaceable star" and "was an aristocrat of screen actors".[160]Variety'sOwen Gleibermanwrote that "in 1970, Donald Sutherland ... was the coolest movie star on the planet. The moment I saw him in "MASH," I knew he was the person I wanted to be, the same way that I wanted to beMick JaggerorSteve McQueen".[161]Canadian Prime MinisterJustin Trudeaustated, "He was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft, and truly a great Canadian artist and he will be deeply missed."[162]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
