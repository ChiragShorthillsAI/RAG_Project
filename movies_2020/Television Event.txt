Nicholas Meyer(born December 24, 1945) is an American screenwriter, director and author known for his best-selling novelThe Seven-Per-Cent Solution, and for directing the filmsTime After Time, two of theStar Trekfeature films, the 1983 television filmThe Day After, and the 1999HBOoriginal filmVendetta.
Meyer was nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Adapted Screenplayfor the filmThe Seven-Per-Cent Solution(1976), where he adapted his own novel into a screenplay. He has also been nominated for aSatellite Award, threeEmmy Awards, and has won fourSaturn Awards. He appeared as himself during the 2017On Cinemaspinoff seriesThe Trial, during which he testified aboutStar TrekandSan Francisco.
Meyer was born in New York City, to aJewishfamily. He is the son of Bernard Constant Meyer (1910–1988), a Manhattan psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, and his first wife, concert pianist Elly (died 1960; née Kassman). He has three sisters.[1]Meyer graduated from theUniversity of Iowawith a degree in theater and filmmaking, and also wrote film reviews for the campus newspaper.
Meyer first gained public attention for his best-selling 1974Sherlock HolmesnovelThe Seven-Per-Cent Solution, a story of Holmes confronting hiscocaineaddiction with the help ofSigmund Freud.
Meyer followed this with four additional Holmes novels:The West End Horror(1976),The Canary Trainer(1993),The Adventure of the Peculiar Protocols(2019), andThe Return of the Pharaoh(2021).[2][3]
Meyer has said thatThe Adventure of the Peculiar Protocolswas inspired bySteven Zipperstein'sPogrom: Kishinev and the Tilt of History.[4]
The Seven-Per-Cent Solutionwas later adapted as a1976 film of the same name, for which Meyer wrote the screenplay. The film was directed byHerbert Rossand starredNicol Williamson,Robert Duvall,Alan ArkinandLaurence Olivier. For his work adapting the novel, Meyer was nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Adapted Screenplayat the49th Academy Awards.
Intrigued by the first part of college friendKarl Alexander's then-incomplete novelTime After Time, Meyer optioned the book and adapted it into a screenplay. He consented to sell the script only if he were attached as director. The deal was optioned byWarner Bros., and the film became Meyer's directorial debut. Meyer freely allowed Alexander to borrow from the screenplay. The latter published his novel at about the same time the movie was released.
Time After Time(1979) starredMalcolm McDowell,Mary SteenburgenandDavid Warner. It was a critical and commercial success.[5]
Meyer next "wanted to make a film of theRobertson Daviesnovel,Fifth Business. And I had written the screenplay. And nobody was interested in doing this." At the behest of then Paramount executive Karen Moore, he was hired to directStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.[6]
Meyer later directed the 1983 television filmThe Day After, starringJason Robards,JoBeth Williams,John Cullum,Bibi Besch,John LithgowandSteve Guttenberg, which depicted the ramifications of a nuclear attack on the United States. Meyer had originally decided not to do any television work, but changed his mind upon reading the script by Edward Hume. For his work onThe Day After, Meyer was nominated for anEmmy Awardfor Best Director. Afterward, he also directed "The Pied Piper of Hamelin", a 1985 episode of the television seriesShelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre.
He resumed directing theatrical films with the 1985 comedyVolunteers, starringTom HanksandJohn Candy. He then returned toStar Trek, co-writing the screenplay forStar Trek IV: The Voyage Home(1986) with producerHarve Bennett.
In 1986 Meyer helpedJames Deardenwrite the screenplay forFatal Attraction, based on a short movie Dearden made in 1980 calledDiversion.[7]In Meyer's bookThe View from the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood, he explains that in late 1986 producerStanley R. Jaffeasked him to look at the script developed by Dearden, and he wrote a four-page memo making suggestions for the script including a new ending for the movie. A few weeks later he met with directorAdrian Lyneand gave him some additional suggestions.
Meyer's next directing job was the 1988Merchant Ivoryproduced dramaThe Deceivers, withPierce Brosnanas British officer William Savage. Meyer later wrote and directed the 1991 spy comedyCompany Business, starringGene HackmanandMikhail Baryshnikovas aging American and Russian secret agents. In 1991, Meyer once again returned to the world ofStar Trek, co-writing and directingStar Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, which became aswan songfor the original cast.[8]Meyer performed uncredited rewrites on an early draft of the screenplay of the 1997James BondfilmTomorrow Never Dies.[9]
Meyer adapted thePhilip RothnovelThe Human Staininto the 2003 film of the same name. In 2006, he teamed withMartin Scorseseto write the screenplay for Scorsese's adaptation ofEdmund Morris'sPulitzer Prizewinning biography ofTheodore Roosevelt,The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. The story traces Roosevelt's early life.
The two part, four hour,History Channelevent miniseries,Houdini, starringAdrien Brody, aired over Labor Day 2014. Meyer's script was nominated for a WGA award and the series was nominated for seven Emmys.
In 2016, he co-created the Italian-British seriesMedici: Masters of FlorencewithFrank Spotnitzfor Italian TV channelRai 1, and wrote the first two episodes of season one.
Meyer, along with writer/producerHarve Bennett, is one of two people credited with revitalizing and perhaps saving theStar Trekfranchise after the problems of the first film,Star Trek: The Motion Picture, almost causedParamount Picturesto end the series. Paramount had been unhappy with the creative direction of the first film, as well as the cost overruns and production problems. However, the film was also a great financial success, and they wanted a sequel. Bennett, a reliable television producer, was hired to help.
Introduced to Bennett by Paramount executive Karen Moore, Meyer was hired as a potential director forStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khandespite never having seen the first film.[10]: 96Due to problems with the early drafts of the script, which most readers disliked, Meyer quickly became involved in re-writing the film's screenplay. After meeting with Bennett and other cast members and crew members regarding the script, Meyer impressedStar Trekactors and producers by delivering a superior script draft in only twelve days. The draft had to be completed so quickly that Meyer agreed to forgo negotiating a contract or credit for his writing to begin work on the script immediately. As a result, he is uncredited as a writer on the final film.
Meyer made stylistic alterations in his direction, such as adding more of a naval appearance to the production. Meyer and Bennett created an engaging film while also reducing costs and avoiding the production fiascoes of the firstStar Trekfilm.[citation needed]The Wrath of Khanbecame a financial success, grossing $78 million in the domestic market, and is considered by many to be the bestStar Trekfilm to date.[11]
Although he "refuse[d] to specialize" and so vowed to not work on anotherStar Trekproject,[12]Meyer co-wrote the screenplay for the fourthStar Trekfilm,Star Trek IV: The Voyage Homewith Bennett. For that film, Bennett wrote the first and thirdacts, which occur in the 23rd century, and Meyer wrote the second act, which occurs in 1986 San Francisco. Meyer has said that one of the most enjoyable aspects of working on this film was getting the chance to re-use elements which he had been forced to discard from his earlier film,Time After Time.Star Trek IVproved to be successful financially,[13]notable for succeeding with general moviegoers as well as science fiction andStar Trekdevotees.
Meyer worked for theStar Trekfranchise again for the sixth film in the series,Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country(1991). He developed the story withLeonard Nimoyand co-wrote the screenplay with long-time friend and assistant Denny Flinn. He directed the picture, which was the final film to feature the entire classicStar Trekcast. Like its predecessors, this film was successful financially, grossing $74 million in the domestic market.[14]Many of Meyer's personal papers from his involvement with theStar Trekfranchise are housed at the University of Iowa Libraries.[15]
In February 2016 it was announced that Meyer would be returning toStar Trekby joining the writing team for CBS's new TV seriesStar Trek: Discovery.[16]In November 2018, Meyer announced in an online interview that he was not invited back forDiscovery's second season. He also disclosed that he could not identify his precise contributions, as television is such a collaborative medium.[17][18]
In 2020, Meyer wrote a detailed proposal with his producing partnerSteven-Charles Jaffefor a newStar Trekproject, including a treatment and illustrations. Meyer said the project was not connected to any of the franchise's previous films and was set in a gap in theStar Trektimeline where an original story could be told with new characters. He described the project as a feature film, but said it could also be a television series or a combination of television and film. Meyer and Jaffe presented this proposal toStar Trektelevision producerAlex Kurtzman, Abrams, and Watts, but had not heard anything back from Paramount by March 2021.[19]At that time, Paramount setStar Trek: DiscoverywriterKalinda Vazquezto write the script for a newStar Trekfilm, based on her own original idea, with Abrams's Bad Robot producing.
Meyer was married to Lauren Taylor Meyer in the late 1980s and they had two daughters, Rachel (b Dec 1986) and Madeleine (b 1990). Meyer's daughter Rachel, now known as screenwriter Dylan Meyer, is the fiancée of actress and filmmakerKristen Stewart.[20][21][22]In 2023, Nicholas Meyer won the Future of Life Award[23]for reducing the risk of nuclear war through the power of storytelling.

To provide for her infant son, his mother sold her personal jewelry and did menial work in London.[3]After he was released from internment, Koppel's father was not permitted to work in England, nor would he allow his wife to work. Following the end of the war, the family earned some money from their confiscated assets and decided to leave for the United States.[3]While in England, Ted Koppel was a pupil atAbbotsholme School, in Derbyshire. In 1953 when he was 13, the family immigrated to the United States,[3]where his mother, Alice, became a singer and pianist, and his father, Edwin, opened a tire factory.[4]Koppel's boyhood hero was radio broadcasterEdward R. Murrow, whose factual reports during thebombing of Londoninspired him to become a journalist.[5]
After attending theMcBurney School, a private preparatory institution in New York,[6]Koppel attendedSyracuse University,[7]graduating at age 20 with aBachelor of Sciencedegree. He was a member of the Alpha Chi chapter of thePi Kappa Alphafraternity. One roommate recalled that Koppel "was incredibly focused and had a photographic memory. He remembers almost every conversation he ever had with anybody. And the man never needs sleep."[8]
Koppel then went toStanford University, where he earned aMaster of Artsdegree inmass-communicationsresearch andpolitical science.[9]While at Stanford, he met his future wife, Grace Anne Dorney.[3]
Koppel had a brief stint as a teacher before being hired as acopyboyatThe New York Timesand as a writer atWMCA Radioin New York. In June 1963, he became the youngest correspondent ever hired byABC Radio News, working on the dailyFlair Reportsprogram. His coverage of theKennedy assassinationin 1963 withCharles Osgoodcaused the national news audience to take notice.[3]He was scheduled to do a short report, but a delay during the crisis forced him to ad-lib for an hour and a half.[5]
In 1964, he covered his first of many presidential nominating conventions. He also began covering thecivil rights movementinSelma, Alabama. ABC officials were impressed by Koppel's ability to clarify issues using plain language.[5]In 1966, he became the ABC News correspondent for theVietnam War, moving from radio broadcasting to national television.[3]He accepted the assignment only after the network agreed to send his wife and their two children to Hong Kong so they could be nearby.[3]Before going he took a course to learn the Vietnamese language.[3]
He returned in 1968 to cover the campaign ofRichard Nixon, before becoming Hong Kong bureau chief, andU.S. State Departmentcorrespondent where Koppel formed a friendship withHenry Kissinger.[3]According to Nixon advisorJohn Ehrlichman, Koppel's friendship with Kissinger was partly due to their similar backgrounds, having Jewish refugee parents and emigrating to America in their youth.[3]
Koppel was among those traveling to China with U.S. PresidentRichard Nixonin 1972. He spoke about it with theUSCUS-China Institute in their "Assignment: China" documentary series about American media coverage of China.[10]Koppel likened the trip to a "journey to the dark side of the moon". By 1975, he was anchoring the ABC Evening News on Saturdays, and he continued to file reports for ABC Radio.[11]
Koppel would often report on State Department foreign conferences, as when he traveled with Kissinger during his meetings in Egypt and Israel in 1975.[3]He said about Kissinger: "I have a high regard for Henry. He has a first-class mind. A half hour with him gives me a better insight into a foreign policy question than hours with others."[3]
In the mid-1970s, Koppel took a year off from his career, to stay home with his children so that his wife could complete her education atGeorgetown Law School. Koppel's decision upset ABC News presidentRoone Arledge, who demoted Koppel from news anchor when he returned to the network.[8]
In April 1979, he was lead reporter for an eleven-segment series, "Second to None?", which focused on explaining the dangers of nuclear war. He did his own research and wanted to present "complex material to an audience that hasn't paid much attention in the past but must in the future ...ifthere is to be a future".[5]For the series he received anAlfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award.[5]
In 1980, Koppel became known for his work as the host of a late night news program calledNightline. The program originated as a series of special reports about the 444-day-longIran hostage crisis, during which Iranian militants held 52 Americans captive, beginning in early November 1979. At first, the program was calledThe Iran Crisis: America Held Hostage, and was hosted byFrank Reynolds. Koppel eventually joined Reynolds as co-anchor. In March 1980, the program evolved intoNightline, with Koppel as its host.[12]Koppel spent twenty-five years anchoring the program, before leaving ABC andNightlinein late November 2005.[13]
While hostingNightline, Koppel also hosted a series of special programs calledViewpoint, beginning in 1981, which provided media criticism and analysis. The show was envisioned by ABC News Vice President George Watson as a way to address any media bias that viewers might believe that they encountered on the network. Broadcast before a live audience, it provided viewers with a chance to question how stories were reported or critique television news.[14]Viewpointwas broadcast sporadically, from 1981 until 1997.
Some liberal groups suggested that Koppel was a conduit for the government's point of view and accused him of favoring conservatives when selecting guests.[15]In the late 1980s, the progressive media criticism organizationFairness and Accuracy in Reporting(FAIR) claimed that policymakers and ex-officials dominated theNightlineguest list, with critics of foreign policy less visible. In 1987,Newsweekcalled him the "quintessential establishment journalist". Koppel responded that "We are governed by the president and his cabinet and their people. And they are the ones who are responsible for our foreign policy, and they are the ones I want to talk to".[16]
In 1990, Koppel interviewedNelson Mandelain a US-styletown hall meeting.[17]Also in 1990, ABC News ran a one-hour special called "The Best of Nightline with Ted Koppel".[18]
In 1997,Nate Thayer, a journalist writing for theFar Eastern Economic Reviewwho later interviewedPol Potshortly before the latter's death, claimed that Koppel andABC Newsmade averbal agreementwith Thayer for the exclusive North American rights to use video from a show trial of Pol Pot that Thayer and Asiaworks Television videographer David McKaige witnessed onNightline. Thayer claimed ABC purportedly violated that agreement by postingscreenshotstills of video from the interview onABCNews.com, violating the license as the site was accessible throughout the world, though not uploading the actual video.[19]
On November 22, 2005, Koppel stepped down fromNightlineafter 25 years with the program and left ABC after 42 years with the network. His finalNightlinebroadcast did not feature clips highlighting memorable interviews and famous moments from his tenure as host, as is typical when an anchor retires. Instead, the show replayed an episode ofNightlinewith Koppel's 1995 interviews with retiredBrandeis Universitysociology professorMorrie Schwartz, who was dying ofLou Gehrig's disease.[20]
On March 24, 2020, Koppel made a guest appearance onNightlineto mark the program's 40th anniversary, discussing how he and his wife had been coping with theCOVID-19 pandemic.[21]

Koppel is married to Grace Anne (née Dorney). He became anaturalizedcitizen of the United States in 1963.[41]They have four children:Andrea(a former journalist), Deirdre, Andrew and Tara.
Andrew Koppel was found dead in an apartment in New York City on May 31, 2010, reportedly after a day-long drinking binge. A post mortem toxicology report identified illicit drugs.[42]
Koppel speaks German and French, in addition to his native English.[7]
A longtime friend of Koppel's was former Secretary of StateHenry Kissinger. Both of them moved to the United States as children. Along with former Secretary of StateAlexander Haig, Kissinger was the most frequent guest onNightline.[16]In a 1989  interview, Koppel commented, "Henry Kissinger is, plain and simply, the best secretary of state we have had in 20, maybe 30 years – certainly one of the two or three great secretaries of state of our century," then added, "I’m proud to be a friend of Henry Kissinger. He is an extraordinary man. This country has lost a lot by not having him in a position of influence and authority".[43]
In 1993, Koppel and his wife paid $2.7 million for 16 acres (6.5 ha) overlooking thePotomac RiverinPotomac, Maryland.[44]They sued to hold their neighbors to an agreement to limit the size of the houses in the neighborhood to 10,000 sq ft (930 m2).[44]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
