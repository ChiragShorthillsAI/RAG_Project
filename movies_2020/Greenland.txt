Structural engineerJohn Garrity lives inAtlanta, Georgiawith his estranged wife, Allison, and theirdiabeticson, Nathan. He is on the way home to watch the near-earth passing of a recently discoveredinterstellarcometnicknamed "Clarke," along with his family and neighbors.
While at the supermarket, John receives an automatedDepartment of Homeland Security(DHS) message announcing that he and his family have been selected for emergency sheltering. He returns home just as a comet fragment is seen entering the atmosphere on live television. Previously expected to land in the ocean nearBermuda, the fragment instead strikesTampa, Florida, vaporizing the city along with most of the state. John then receives a call with instructions to head toRobins Air Force Basefor an evacuation flight, as Clarke is on a direct collision course to Earth and will impact the entire planet to cause anextinction-level eventin two days. John, Allison, and Nathan pack up and drive away.
The way to the base is clogged by heavy traffic, so the Garritys abandon their car and continue on foot. Nathan'sinsulinis accidentally left behind in the car. As they reach the base, John realizes it is missing and goes back to retrieve it. Meanwhile, Nathan's medical condition is discovered, disqualifying him for sheltering, and Allison stays with him. John returns and boards a plane but quickly jumps off upon realizing Allison and Nathan were left behind.
As John exits the base, a panicked mob breaks in, destroying several evacuation planes when gunfire ignites spilled jet fuel. Returning to their car, John finds Allison's note saying they are going to her father's home inLexington, Kentucky. After getting medical supplies, Allison and Nathan hitch a ride from Ralph and Judy Vento, only for Ralph to kidnap Nathan in order to use him and the wristbands to board a flight.
John hitch-hikes a ride on a truck full of people heading towardsCanada, planning to get off in Lexington. A passenger named Colin tells him they are headed toOsgoode, Ontario, where private planes are flying toGreenland, believed to be the military evacuation site. Another man attempts to steal John's wristband, causing the truck to crash, killing Colin. John is forced to kill the other man inself-defense.
At another air force base, the Ventos attempt to pose as Nathan's parents, but are arrested when the soldiers discover that Nathan is not their child. Allison and Nathan are reunited shortly after at a nearbyFederal Emergency Management Agency(FEMA) camp.
The following morning, John learns that the largest fragment will hit in approximately 24 hours. Stealing a car, John reaches his father-in-law, Dale's house, and Nathan and Allison arrive shortly after. The family learn about a complex ofunderground bunkersnearPituffik Space BaseinGreenland, confirming that's where the evacuees are being sent. Dale chooses to stay behind, bidding farewell to his daughter's family.
John, Allison and Nathan proceed in Dale's truck. While making steady progress to Osgoode, the family learns over the radio that Clarke's largest fragment, which is 9 miles (14 km) wide, will hitWestern Europeand obliterate it. They arrive at the Osgoode airport just in time to board the last flight out. As they reach Greenland, a comet fragment strike causes the plane to crash land. The Garritys and the rest of the passengers flag down a military truck and enter the bunker complex right as the largest fragment enters the atmosphere and hits Earth, devastating civilization.
Nine months later, the bunker is able to make radio contact with other survivors around the world. The Garritys and other occupants exit the shelter, as reports came in that the atmosphere is finally clearing, giving the survivors the chance to bring Earth back onto its feet.

In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began work on conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014 (the "S" standing for Simonds, the company's founder; the "T" standing forTPG Growth, whose managing partner McGlashan helped launch the company; and the "X" standing for "secret project"),[2]with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and distribute star-driven content around the world.[3][4]Investors in the company includedHony Capital,Tencent,PCCW, TPG Growth,RTL GroupandLiberty Global. Individual investors includeGigi Pritzker,Beau Wrigley, andDominic Ng.[5][6][7]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
