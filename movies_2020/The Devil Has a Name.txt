Sheen has directed one film,Cadence(1990), in which he appears alongside his sonsCharlieandRamón. He has narrated, produced, and directed documentary projects and has been active inliberal politics.
Sheen was born inDayton, Ohio, on August 3, 1940, to Mary-Ann (née Phelan) and Francisco Estévez Martínez.[4][5]During birth, Sheen's left arm was crushed byforceps, giving him limited lateral movement of that arm (Erb's palsy) and resulting in the arm being three inches (8 cm) shorter than his right.[6]Both of Sheen's parents were immigrants; his mother was Irish, fromBorrisokane,County Tipperary, and his father, who was Galician, was born inSalceda de Caselas,Galicia.[7][8]After moving to Dayton in the 1930s, his father was a factory worker/machinery inspector at theNational Cash Register Company.[9]Sheen's maternal uncle, Michael Phelan, fought in theIrish Civil Waras a volunteer in theAnti-Treaty Irish Republican Army, and was imprisoned inKilmainham Gaol,Dublin.[10]Sheen grew up on Brown Street in theSouth Parkneighborhood, the seventh of ten children (nine boys and a girl).[8]Due to his father's work, the family lived on the island ofBermudaon St. John's Road,Pembroke Parish, where five of his brothers were born. Martin was the first child to be born in Dayton, Ohio, after the family returned from Bermuda.[11][citation needed]Sheen contractedpolioas a child and had to remain bedridden for a year. His doctor's treatment usingSister Kenny's method helped him regain use of his legs.[8]
When he was eleven years old, Sheen's mother died, and the children faced the possibility of living in anorphanageorfoster homes. The family was able to remain together with the assistance of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Dayton.[12]Raised as aCatholic, he graduated fromChaminade High School(now Chaminade Julienne Catholic High School).[8][13]At fourteen years old he organized a strike of golf caddies while working at a private golf club in Dayton, Ohio. He complained about the golfers, saying: "They often used obscene language in front of us... we were little boys and they were abusive... anti-Semitic.... And they, for the most part, were upstanding members of the community."[14]
Sheen was drawn to acting at a young age, but his father disapproved of his interest in the field. Despite his father's opposition, Sheen borrowed money from a Catholic priest and moved to New York City in his early twenties, hoping to make it as an actor.[9]He spent two years in theLiving Theatrecompany.

He adopted hisstage name, Martin Sheen, from a combination of theCBScasting director, Robert Dale Martin, who gave him his first big break, and Catholic archbishop and broadcaster,Fulton J. Sheen.[17]In a 2003Inside the Actors Studiointerview, Sheen explained,
Whenever I would call for an appointment, whether it was a job or an apartment, and I would give my name, there was always that hesitation and when I'd get there, it was always gone. So I thought, I got enough problems trying to get an acting job, so I invented Martin Sheen. It's still Estevez officially. I never changed it officially. I never will. It's on my driver's license and passport and everything. I started using Sheen, I thought I'd give it a try, and before I knew it, I started making a living with it and then it was too late. In fact, one of my great regrets is that I didn't keep my name as it was given to me. I knew it bothered my dad.[8][9][17][18]
Sheen was greatly influenced by the actorJames Dean.[8]Speaking of the impact Dean had on him, Sheen stated, "All of his movies had a profound effect on my life, in my work and all of my generation.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
