song. Sol starts working at Jenn's cousin Gina's successful restaurant.
One night, Sol wakes up screaming in pain. Although he has cancer, he reassures Jen that everything will be okay once he gets treatment. Sol suggests they get a dog if the news is bad.
After returning from the doctor's, he tells them that everything is fine and that the labs are good. The couple continues planning the wedding and Sol returns to the restaurant, where his dish is put on the menu.
One day, Sol texts Jen to come home and greets her with a dog named Otis, his way of telling her his cancer has returned. A few months later, he is accepted for a clinical trial. They discuss postponing the wedding, but their friends offer to throw them a quick wedding in three weeks. They fund it with the help of strangers through crowd-funding and putting up posters all over town and friends while Sol undergoes his treatment. Sol's friend Kyle misses everything because his illness reminds him of losing his dad, which he hasn't dealt with.
Sol tells Jenn about suffering from all of the drug trial's side effects, including his sense of taste. He tells her to just move on with her life, but she insists on staying by his side. Jenn and Sol get married in front of all their friends and family. Kyle finally shows up at the reception.

However, Steve Pond ofTheWrapnoted that "All My Lifeis nothing if not pleasant and amiable as it makes its way down the road to heartwarming"[27]and Courtney Howard ofVarietywrote "The warmth and touching tenderness ofAll My Lifemelts even the coldest of hearts in its quest to deliver happy and sad tears. Unlike the phony, syrupy, and predictably manipulative devices of a Nicholas Sparks romance, this three-hankie weepie holds a surprising amount of heart and hope to accompany all the cathartic crying."[28]

Settle originated the role of Norma Valverde inHands on a Hardbody, a musical which ran briefly on Broadway in 2013, and is based on the 1997 documentary about real people competing to win a new truck. TheTheatreManiareviewer wrote: "Settle, as Norma, steals every scene she's in. The spectacularly bizarre lead-in to her big number, 'Joy of the Lord,' is more difficult to pull off than most Shakespearean monologues, and her solo vocals reveal a soulful, oversized gospel range that drives the Holy Spirit straight to the back of the theater. When she tearfully realizes what her faith in God may have wrought, it stings like a chigger bite. Settle's touching performance should go on the shortlist for every Best Featured Actress prize in town."[3]For this role, Settle was nominated for theOuter Critics Circle,Drama Desk, andTony AwardforBest Featured Actress in a Musical.[4][5][6][7]Additionally, she was awarded theTheatre World Awardfor Outstanding Broadway or Off-Broadway debut performance during the 2012-13 theatrical season.[8]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
