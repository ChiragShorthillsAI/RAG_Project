In 1940,Orson Wellesis given complete creative freedom for his next project byRKO. For the screenplay, Welles recruitsHerman J. Mankiewicz, who is inVictorville, California, recovering from a broken leg he sustained in a car crash. Hermandictatesthe script to his secretary, Rita Alexander, who notices similarities between the main character (Charles Foster Kane) andWilliam Randolph Hearst. ProducerJohn Housemanis concerned about Herman's dense,nonlinearscreenplay, while Herman's brotherJosephworries that it may anger the powerful Hearst.
In 1930, Herman visits anMGMlocationwhere he and the female lead,Marion Davies, recognize each other. She introduces him to Hearst, her benefactor and lover, who takes a liking to Herman. In 1933, Herman and his wife Sara attendLouis B. Mayer's birthday party atHearst Castlewith manyHollywoodbigwigs. They discuss the rise ofNazi Germanyand the upcominggubernatorial election, in particular candidateUpton Sinclair. Herman and Marion go for a stroll, where they bond over discussions on politics and thefilm industry.
In 1940, Houseman grows impatient over Herman's lack of progress. Rita is also concerned with the timing of the writing and Herman'salcoholism. He does finishthe screenplayin time. Houseman is impressed but reminds Herman that he will receive no credit for his work.
In 1934, Herman and Joseph begin working at MGM under Mayer. Studio executives, includingIrving Thalberg, actively work againstSinclair's gubernatorial campaign. The studio producespropaganda filmsfor asmear campaign, funded by Hearst, against Sinclair. Herman approaches Marion to pull the films but is unsuccessful as she has already left the studio forWarner Bros.Herman and Sara later attend anelection nightwatch party at theTrocadero Nightclub, where Mayer announces the winner,Frank Merriam. Herman's colleague, director Shelly Metcalf, shoots andkills himselfafter being diagnosed withParkinson's diseaseand guilt-ridden over his role in the smear campaign, despite personally supporting Sinclair.
In 1940,Charles Ledererpicks up the screenplay from Herman to deliver to the studio. Joseph visits Herman after reading it, warning him of Hearst's reaction and how it might affect Marion. He does, however, believe that it is the finest thing Herman has ever written. Marion also visits and does her best to persuade Herman to change the screenplay but to no avail. She tells Herman she will try to stop the picture from getting made.
In 1937, Hermancrashes a partyat Hearst Castle, where he drunkenly pitches the idea for the film he will later write, offending everyone present, including Hearst, Mayer, and Marion. An enraged Mayer reveals that Herman is on Hearst's payroll and calls him acourt jester. Hearst tells him anallegoryabout a monkey and anorgan grinderand sees him out.
In 1940, despite pressure from Hearst, Welles is determined to make the film and intends to do a re-write without Herman. He visits Herman and offers him abuyoutfrom the studio. However, reneging on the terms of his contract, Herman requests credit for the script, declaring it his greatest work. An upset Welles tells Herman that he has gone to bat for him before leaving angrily. Herman ultimately receives joint credit with Welles, and they win theAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplayfor the film (Citizen Kane) two years later.

Mankwas officially announced in July 2019, whenDavid Finchersaid he would direct the film, withGary Oldmanset to star. The screenplay was written by Fincher's father,Jack Fincher, prior to his death in 2003. It was originally going to be Fincher's follow-up toThe Game(1997) withKevin SpaceyandJodie Fosterset to star but never came to fruition due to Fincher's insistence on shooting inblack-and-white.[8][9]Additional casting was announced in October, withAmanda Seyfried,Lily Collins,Tuppence Middleton,Arliss Howard, andCharles Danceamong the new cast added.[10]
Fincher reunites with much of his usual filmmaking team, including production designerDonald Graham Burt, editorKirk Baxter, and composersTrent ReznorandAtticus Ross, using only period-authentic instruments. Fincher opted for cinematographerErik Messerschmidt, with whom he worked on hisNetflixseriesMindhunter.[11][12][13]
The 120-page draft of the initial script revealed that Jack Fincher closely followed a claim voiced byPauline Kaelin her 1971New Yorkerarticle "Raising Kane" that Welles did not deserve screenwriting credit.[14]The article angered many critics, including Welles's friend and fellow filmmakerPeter Bogdanovichwho rebutted Kael's claims point by point in "The Kane Mutiny", an October 1972 article forEsquire.[15]Her argument was discredited by several film scholars through the years, including Robert L. Carringer in his study of "The Scripts ofCitizen Kane."[16]
Many current academics and critics were sparked to action byMank's many-times over debunked premise that the script was Mankiewicz's alone, includingNY Timeswriter Ben Kenigsberg,[17]andJonathan Rosenbaum, editor of the Welles-Bogdanovich bookThis Is Orson Welles, who wrote "...Finchers Senior and Junior, willing and eager to accept and further spread Kael's inaccurate assertion that Herman J. Mankiewicz was the only screenwriter onCitizen Kane, not bothering to research the matter."[18]
MankproducerEric Rothreportedly polished the script prior to filming,[19]with David Fincher saying he felt early drafts were too anti-Welles.[20]When asked about the controversy surrounding authorship, Fincher stated that his movie does not aim to settle the issue: "It was not my interest to make a movie about a posthumous credit arbitration. I was interested in making a movie about a man who agreed not to take any credit. And who then changed his mind. That was interesting to me."[17]
Filming began on November 1, 2019, inLos Angeles.[21]It also took place inVictorville, California, and wrapped on February 4, 2020.[22]The film was shot in black and white on Fincher's preferredREDdigital camera and made reference to the aesthetics ofCitizen KanecinematographerGregg Toland.[23]Dance stated that a scene involving a drunken Mankiewicz took over 100 takes,[24]while Seyfried said that one of her scenes took over a week and 200 takes to shoot.[25]She stated, "It does feel likeGroundhog Day, in a way, but that's how [Fincher] captures things that most people don't."[24]The moonlight stroll between Mankiewicz and Davies was filmed atHuntington Gardensand aPasadenamansion during the day, although it takes place at night. This was done using theday for nighttechnique. Shooting it during the day was necessary for the lighting Messerschmidt needed for the scene.[23]
For designing the costumes, costume designerTrish Summervilleand production designerDonald Graham Burtused thenoirandmonochromaticfilters on theiriPhonesto see how they would look in black and white. Because the film was shot in black and white and not converted afterwards, it meant Summerville had to pick colors that would pop. She looked at photos from 1930s Hollywood to see what was worn at the time.[26]
Fincher's frequent collaboratorsTrent ReznorandAtticus Rosscomposed the score forMank. Forgoing their usual synth-heavy style, Reznor and Ross used period-authentic instrumentation from the 1940s to accompany the film.[27]As a result of theCOVID-19 pandemic, each member of the orchestra recorded their sections for the score from home.[28]The entire soundtrack is composed of songs written and performed by Reznor and Ross and runs for 52 tracks at over an hour and a half,[29][30]and was released by The Null Corporation on December 4, 2020, the same day coinciding with the film's release.[31]An extended soundtrack (featuring unreleased music and demos not featured in the film) that runs over three hours with 87 tracks, was released through Bandcamp the following week, December 11.[30][32]
Mankwas released in alimited theatrical releasein the United States on November 13, 2020,[20]before beginning to stream worldwide on Netflix on December 4, 2020.[2]
IndieWirereported the film played in 75 theaters during its opening weekend and did "similar business" as other new indie releasesThe ClimbandAmmonite, which each averaged about $300 per venue (which would mean a $22,500 debut forMank).[33]Upon the film's release onto Netflix, it only managed to finish in the top-10 on its first day. IndieWire wrote that it just "didn't gain the attention of other high-profile originals likeDa 5 Bloods,The Trial of the Chicago 7, andHillbilly Elegy," all of which debuted in first or second place.[34]
Review aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoesreports that 83% of 351 critic reviews were positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "Sharply written and brilliantly performed,Mankpeers behind the scenes ofCitizen Kaneto tell an old Hollywood story that could end up being a classic in its own right."[35]According toMetacritic, which compiled 52 reviews and calculated a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, the film received "generally favorable reviews".[36]
Eric Kohn ofIndieWiregave the film a "B+" and wrote: "However much credit Mankiewicz deserves forKane,Fincher's remarkable movie makes a compelling argument for appreciating the prescience behind its conception. His life had a rough ending, but the movie about it gives him one last bitter laugh."[37]Writing for theLos Angeles Times,Justin Changsaid, "Mankdemands your surrender, but also your heightened attention. It's a pleasurably discombobulating experience, sometimes playing like mordant drawing-room comedy and sometimes flirting with expressionist nightmare, as when Welles' dark silhouette looms over a bedridden Mank and his mummified leg."[38]
Owen GleibermanofVarietypraised the performances and production design, saying, "Mankis a tale ofOld Hollywoodthat's more steeped in Old Hollywood – its glamour and sleaze, its layer-cake hierarchies, its corruption and glory – than just about any movie you've seen, and the effect is to lend it a dizzying time-machine splendor."[39]Peter Travers, reviewing the film forABC News, wrote: "Mankis the most gorgeous piece of cinema you'll see anywhere. Brilliantly shot in black-and-white byErik Messerschmidt, with costumes to die for by Trish Summerville and a period-authentic score byTrent ReznorandAtticus Rossthat somehow isn't defeated by the retromono sound,Mankis meant to match the look and feel of its era, as if it's eight decades ago and you just bought a ticket."[40]
Jason Bailey ofThe Playlistwas more mixed and gave the film a "C+" grade, calling it a "gorgeously mounted but ultimately distant biopic".[41]The A.V. Club'sIgnatiy Vishnevetskythought it was "conventional to a fault", writing that parts of the film "bear an uncanny resemblance to the kind of awards-bait middlebrow drama usually essayed by BBC-trained hacks."[42]
Mankappeared on 50 critics' year-end top-10 lists, including four first-place rankings and five second place ones.[43]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
