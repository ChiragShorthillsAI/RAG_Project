Ellie observes from afar that Paul's second date with Aster starts off as badly as the first. In a desperate bid to save the evening, Ellie sends Aster text messages via the user account secretlysharedby the phones of both Ellie and Paul while Paul plays along by pretending to type on his phone. Paul on the following day divulges to Ellie that he had kissed Aster - without genuine approval or input from Aster, and even despite telling Aster to keep their relationshipplatonic- unnerving Ellie.

Alice Wustarted writingThe Half of Itin the aftermath of the2016 United States presidential election.[2][3]The screenplay drew inspiration from the 1897 playCyrano de BergeracbyEdmond Rostand.[4][5]In April 2019, it was announced thatLeah Lewis,Alexxis Lemire,Daniel Diemer,Becky Ann Baker,Catherine Curtin,Wolfgang Novogratz, andEnrique Murcianojoined the cast of the film, with Wu directing andNetflixdistributing.[6]Anthony Bregman ofLikely Story, M. Blair Breard, and Wu served as producers, and Likely Story's Erica Matlin and Greg Zuk executive produced. In June 2019, it was announced thatCollin Chouhad joined the cast.[7]
The film's name alludes tolove as discussed in Plato'sSymposium- which was cited in the opening sequence[8][9]and structured various visual motifs.[10]
Principal photographybegan on April 22, 2019, inNew York, and concluded on May 31, 2019.[11][12]
It was scheduled to have its world premiere at theTribeca Film Festivalon April 18, 2020.[13][14]However, the festival was postponed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[15]It was released on May 1, 2020.[16]
Wu did a test screening in a small conservative suburb to know how those morally aligned against the movie would feel about it. She was surprised that "[p]eople marked the film as ‘excellent’ and they said they're politically conservative". She gleaned that "there are a lot of closeted people who are actually starting to change their mind", and that Netflix could better reach them—even though a theatrical release would "be better for you as a filmmaker in terms ofcachet". When probed by a Netflix executive on her intentions for writing the film, she realized that "people are not going to go to the theater to watch this movie but in the privacy of their own home".[14]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 97% of 104 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's consensus reads: "For viewers in search of an uncommonly smart, tender, and funny coming-of-age story,The Half of Ithas everything."[17]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 74 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[18]
Decidersaid the plot is  "an unbearably cute premise—a modern-dayCyrano de Bergeracwith a queer twist—that seems so perfect and so obvious, it’s a wonder the movie hasn’t been made yet", and "an adorable teen film that will no doubt service an extremely underserved audience."[19]Rolling Stonepraised the direction, stating that "the gentle touch Wu uses as a filmmaker, which only occasionally drifts into tidiness, does not dull the edges of her quietly revolutionary achievement in telling the story of a young lesbian immigrant’s journey to self-acceptance. In a movie brimming over with the pleasures of the unexpected, that’s the best part."[20]The New York Timesnoted that "Wu suffuses the film with a painfully mature understanding of the ache of longing for the impossible."[21]
Bitchmagazine wrote that "while these teenage-focused [...] movies flirt with the idea of lesbian relationships, they quickly pivot before their casual interest can evolve into any fully realized romance", with the film's story seeming "to be more about the halfway happiness Ellie's given: maybe some acceptance, maybe a friend, maybe a first love. It's not the happy story we were sold via the trailer, and it feels like more promises that only halfway delivered."[22]
Leah Lewis toldTeen Voguein an interview on 1 May 2020 that: "Most people think a love story has an equation, and that's usually boy meets girl, girl meets boy, or girl meets girl." However, in this case "[i]t's a self-love story because these characters don't really end up with each other, but at the very end, they end up withsomething. For me, that's even more valuable than just finding your other half; it's finding a part of yourself along the way. It is a love story, it's just not a 'romance' story."[23]
In a post dated May 22, 2020,A.O. Scottrecommended it as his top film of 2020 so far.[24]Similarly, Educating Georgia's film expert Steph called it their film of 2020 in their retrospective of the year.[25]
Christy LemireonRogerEbert.comfound the film's "languid" pacing to be a double-edged sword.[26]
The Half of Itwon the top prize, the Founders Award for Best U.S. Narrative Feature, at the 2020Tribeca Film Festival.[27][28][29][30]The film was nominated forBest Screenplay(for Wu) at the36th Independent Spirit Awards,[31][32]and forOutstanding Film – Limited Releaseat the32nd GLAAD Media Awards.[33][34]

Alice Wu(Chinese:伍思薇; born April 21, 1970)[1]is an American film director and screenwriter, known for her filmsSaving Face(2004) andThe Half of It(2020).
Both of her films feature Chinese-American main characters and explore the lives of intellectual, lesbian characters. A number of production companies offered to buy the script forSaving Face, but Wu opted not to sell it in order to uphold an authentic portrayal of the Taiwanese-American community.[2]Saving Faceand Wu's impact on the industry have paved the way for greater Asian representation in the film industry today. Her work has inspired Asian-American actresses such asAwkwafinaandLana Condor.[3]
Alice Wu was born inSan Jose, California[1]toTaiwanese Americanimmigrant parents.[4]Her family eventually moved toLos Altos, California, where she graduated fromLos Altos High Schoolin 1986.[5]She enrolled at theMassachusetts Institute of Technologyat the age of 16.[6]She later transferred toStanford University, where she earned her B.S. incomputer sciencein 1990 and her master's degree in computer science in 1992. Before becoming a filmmaker, Wu worked as asoftware engineerforMicrosoftin Seattle.
While working at Microsoft, Wu began writing a novel. Deciding the story would work better as a film, she signed up for a 12-week screenwriting class at theUniversity of Washingtonin which she penned the script for her first feature film. She then left the corporate world and eventually moved toNew York Cityto pursue a filmmaking career full-time.[4]
Encouraged by her screenwriting teacher, she left Microsoft in the late 1990s to try to turn the script for her first feature filmSaving Faceinto a film, giving herself a five-year window. Production had begun when she reached the fifth year.[4]In 2001, the script forSaving Facewon the Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment screenwriting award.
Saving Facewas released in 2004. The film was inspired by her own experiences coming out as a lesbian in theTaiwanese Americancommunity.  She has said that she would like the audience to come away from it "with this feeling that, no matter who they are, whether they are gay or straight, or whatever their cultural make-up is, that if there is something that they secretly wanted, whether it's this feeling that they could actually have that great love or whatever it is, that it's never too late to have that. I want them to leave the theater feeling a sense of hope and possibility."[7]Alice struggled with her sexual identity and when she came out as a lesbian she had a difference of opinions with her mother which led to a fall out between thetwo. In an interview withJan Lisa Huttner, Wu noted that not all of her audience was female, Asian, or lesbian. She found it "highly unusual" that "you can take a group that seems so specific, and make them universally human".[8]
The film has been influential within both lesbian and Chinese communities. It heavily focuses on the challenges faced within the Chinese-American community, dealing with issues of the role of women and lesbian identity.[9]Wu also explores relationships between mothers and daughters in the Chinese-American community through her portrayal of the relationship between the film's main character and her mother.[10]Although she claims that the film's main character is not an autobiographical portrayal of her real life, it was partially a way to provide positive representation for her own mother.[11]
Saving Facehas secured Wu as a role model for other Chinese-Americans in the film industry.Awkwafinahad aSaving Faceposter hanging up in her bedroom inFlushing, Queens. She describes the film as "the first film that spoke to her as an Asian-American."[3]
The film had its world premiere at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival, and its U.S. premiere at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. Sony Pictures Classics released the film in May 2005.
AfterSaving Face, Wu subsequently worked on a film based onRachel DeWoskin's memoir,Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China.[12]The movie, however, did not make it past pre-production.
In 2008, she sold a pitch to ABC called "Foobar" based on her experiences working as a woman in the tech world.[13]
After the pitch, Wu left the industry for a period to take care of her mother who was ill. She lived off of her savings and income from Microsoft andSaving Faceand kept a low profile. However, most of her friends hadn't had a clue what she was doing, career-wise. When asked if they knew what she had been doing all these years between "Foobar" andThe Half of It, her “Saving Face” friends had hardly any idea.[3]
After her mother's condition improved, Wu started writing again, but continually encounteredwriter's block. To get over this hurdle, Wu wrote a $1,000 check out to theNational Rifle Association of America, an organization she despises, and gave it to her friend. She told her, "if this first draft is not written, you are sending that check in."[3]This draft evolved intoThe Half of It,acoming-of-agecomedy-dramafilm written, directed, and produced by Wu.[3]
The feature script appeared onthe Black Listin 2018.[14]The film is a romantic comedy which follows a Chinese-American teenager as she helps a boy win over his crush, who she also has a romantic interest in. It is loosely based on her own teenage bond with an unexpected friend.[15]The film starsCharmedactressLeah Lewis,Daniel Diemer, andAlexxis Lemirein the leading roles.[16]The film was announced in April 2020 as the winner of the Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature at the 2020Tribeca Film Festival.[17]It was released onNetflixon May 1, 2020 and received highly positive reviews.[18][19]
In 2022, Wu wrote and directed the commercial "The Note," forOreo, in collaboration withPFLAG. "The Note" showcases one step in a young Chinese American man’s coming out journey and emphasizes the role family members can play as lifelong allies for their LGBTQ+ loved ones.
In March 2005, Wu's filmSaving Facewas the opening film at theSan Francisco International Asian American Film Festival.[20]Later that year, she received the Visionary award at theSan Diego Asian Film Festivalto celebrate her directorial debut forSaving Face,[21]and was nominated in thebreakthrough director categoryat theGotham Independent Film Awards, although she did not win.[22]In 2006,Saving Facereceived a nomination at theGLAAD Media Awards,[23]and it won the Viewer's Choice Award at theGolden Horse Awards, Taiwan's equivalent ofThe Academy Awards.[3]In 2019, the film was named one of the 20 Best Asian American Films of the Last 20 Years byThe Los Angeles Times.[24]
In April 2020, Wu's filmThe Half of Itwon the Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature (in the U.S. Narrative Competition category) at the 2020Tribeca Film Festival.[25]
In June 2020, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first LGBTQPride parade,Queertynamed her among the fifty heroes “leading the nation toward equality, acceptance, and dignity for all people”.[26][27]
In 2021, Wu was nominated for anIndependent Spirit Awardfor Best Screenplay forThe Half of It.
Wu is alesbian, and finally came out to herself while taking a feminist studies class atStanford. Wu came out to her mother during a conversation with her (inMandarin Chinese) about the class.[28]
Wu lives a private life.[29]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin. Since 1980, it has been struck in most years by theRoyal Mintfor sale to collectors and investors.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
