It was released onvideo-on-demand, digital platforms and in selectdrive-in theaterson June 5, 2020, byQuiver DistributionandRedbox Entertainment.

Thirteen-year-old Becky Hopper is questioned about a recent incident at her family's lakehouse two weeks earlier. She gives vague answers and claims not to remember anything apart from some minor details. The story unfolds through her flashbacks.
Becky's mother died from cancer a year earlier, and she has a strained relationship with her father Jeff. In an attempt to reconnect with her, they go on a trip to the family's old lakefront home. Meanwhile, prisoner Dominick Lewis, aNeo-Nazi, and his men Wallace "Apex" Landham, Sonny Cole, and Roman Hammond are transferred in a prison van. The group kills an inmate to get the van to pull over, kills the guard and escapes. They stop a car and steal it, killing the occupants in the process, a father and two young children.
Jeff's girlfriend Kayla and her young son Ty arrive at the house, upsetting Becky. Jeff announces his engagement to Kayla. Becky storms out of the house, followed by herCane Corsodog, Diego. At her small fort in the woods, she accidentally knocks over a box of old possessions: a Canadian coin, a bird skull and a key whose bow is formed in the shape of avalknut. Dominick and his men show up at the family house, take everyone hostage, and demand the key. Kayla and Ty try to escape but are caught by Apex, who tries to help them, while Cole kills Dora, the family's other dog. Jeff lies about Becky's presence to protect her, but Dominick shoots Kayla to get the truth out of them.
Becky becomes aware of the assailants' presence and talks over awalkie-talkie, pretending to call the police. Dominick calls her bluff and begins torturing Jeff to lure her out. Dominick allows Jeff to talk to Becky, but Jeff tells her to run. Jeff breaks free and finds Becky, telling her he loves her, before Dominick shoots him dead. Dominick demands the key, but Becky gouges out his left eye with it before fleeing with Diego.
Dominick goes back into the house and sends Cole and Hammond to retrieve the key. Cole chases Becky back to her fort and tries to negotiate, but she ambushes and kills him with colored pencils and a sharp ruler.
Apex shows Kayla and Ty compassion, and Dominick tries to have Apex reaffirm his loyalty to him. After finding Cole's corpse, Hammond chases Becky down to the lake, where she makes him trip and land on a wooden plank of nails. Hammond falls in the lake, and Becky uses a nearby boat propeller to kill him. She is found by Apex, who momentarily incapacitates Diego. Not wanting to hurt Becky, Apex urges her to flee.
Becky makes her presence known to Kayla and Ty; Kayla tries to distract Dominick by asking him about the key's purpose. Becky sets off the car alarm to lure Dominick out, while Kayla tries to free herself. Apex fends off Dominick long enough for Becky to run a lawnmover over Dominick's head, and then shoots the apologetic Apex dead. Kayla and Ty come out with Diego and sit beside Becky as they wait for the police. In the present, Becky claims she does not remember the gang's deaths, with a cold look on her face, one hand nonchalantly playing with the key dangling on a string around her neck.

Dennis Harvey ofVarietycalled the film an "over-the-top yet effectively taut thriller" and "Wilson's nimble half-brat, half-she-devil performance is key to our buying the basic premise, aided by solid supporting cast contributions. James grows less intimidating the more dialogue he's given in an otherwise trim script by marital duo Ruckus and Lane Skye."[19]Jordan Mintzer ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "Beckytends to work best when it revels in the blood-splattered set pieces of its script (written by Ruckus Skye, Lane Skye and Nick Morris), going that extra mile and a half in the gore department (special effects makeup was by Karlee Morse) to create some truly disgusting moments, albeit ones that are laced with a grim sense of humor."[20]
A sequel,The Wrath of Becky, had its world premiere atSouth by Southwest(SXSW) on March 10, 2023, with Wilson returning in the eponymous role.[21]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
