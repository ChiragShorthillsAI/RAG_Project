Anna Wyncomb works in a coffee shop and her dad, Ed, has dated Chuck since her mom, Mary, died nine months ago. One night, Anna and her best friend Charleen, a police officer, accidentally set the coffee shop on fire after enjoying a joint. Now blaming herself for the incident and totally broke, Charleen takes Anna to the underground all-female fight club and introduces her to Bear, the manager and the referee of the fight club. There, Charleen explains to Anna that the winning fighter puts a dollar bill on the wall with their name on it and the fight club serves as a safe haven for women, who want to cope with the problems of their lives. Charleen persuades Anna that she must agree to fight in order to resolve her problems. Anna reluctantly agrees and fights in her first bout but is easily knocked out. Anna realizes that her mom founded the fight club and has fought several bouts, a secret that her mom kept from Anna her whole life, dying from cancer six months after her final fight.
Anna is then introduced to former boxing coach Jack Murphy, who now works in a restaurant at the beachside and agrees to train her. She later meets Olivia, an undefeated fighter, who antagonizes her and Anna challenges her to a fight, which she accepts. As the days and her training progresses, she wins several fights. Anna is attracted to Roy, the attending doctor for the fight club who also works in the local hospital - despite the fact that he has a relationship with Olivia. However, they end their relationship after a drunken night. However, Anna did not take it seriously and ignores his advances. Anna later witnesses Olivia fighting three girls in the ring and savagely knocking out all of them. Realizing how savage Olivia is, Anna quits, saying that fighting is not the best solution to solving her problems.
The next day, Jack convinces Anna to continue to fight and tells her to "leave behind fear and doubt and take that final step to bravery". Anna then receives a call from Chuck saying that her dad is in the hospital after suffering a heart attack. Arriving there with Charleen already at the room, Ed tells Anna that he knows her mom founded the fight club and has passed its ownership to Anna. Charleen convinces Anna to sell the fight club and start a new life. When Roy appears, Ed persuades Anna to reconnect with him. She apologizes to him, and Roy reveals to her that he never had sex with Olivia and has been only thinking of Anna.
On the night of her fight, with renewed courage, Anna confronts Olivia for the first time in the ring. Anna is overwhelmed by Olivia in early rounds, but as per Jack's advice, Anna uses her headbutt to knock her out, eventually winning the fight and thus marking Olivia's first loss. As the police arrives at the door to raid the fight club, Olivia pays respect to Anna before escaping with the fellow fighters and, despite Charleen's objection, Anna chooses to stay behind, stating that she now takes the ownership of her mom's fight club, and is arrested.
Charleen bails Anna out of jail but Anna is put on trial for her misdemeanor. Aided by her lawyer Chuck and the presiding judge Naomi Andrews, Mary's old friend, Anna is acquitted of all charges. Three months later, Anna has renovated the fight club and she agrees to fight with Charleen as a friendly fight. But the two get knocked out at the same time and call Roy for medical attention. Later, Anna goes to the restaurant to pay Jack for her training fee but is shocked to find that she has to pay much more than she had expected.

Frank Scheck ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "There are some undeniably amusing moments, thanks largely to a cast unafraid to throw themselves into the raunchiness and violence with full abandon, but it's hard to avoid the feeling that the film represents a missed opportunity."[13]Jessica Kiang ofVarietywrote: "Instead of the cleavage, hair-pulling and Jerry Springer antics it teases,Chick Fightserves up a blandly formulaic and scrupulously inoffensive tale of female empowerment."[14]

Redbox Automated Retail, LLCwas an Americanvideo rentalandstreaming mediacompany, based inOakbrook Terrace, Illinoiswest ofChicago. Redbox specialized inautomated DVD rental kiosks, and operatedtransactionaland ad-supportedstreaming videoandtelevisionservices. From 2022 until its liquidation, Redbox was a wholly owned subsidiary ofChicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment.[2]
Redbox kiosks, which rented and sold films onDVDandBlu-ray, were located at retail stores, includingconvenience stores,supermarkets, andpharmacies. At its peak in the early 2010s, the company operated kiosks at more than 34,000 locations,[a][3][4]and controlled more than half of the US DVD rental market.[5][6]
In June 2024, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment filed forChapter 11 bankruptcy; the following month, the company’s case was converted toChapter 7 liquidation. As part of ongoing liquidation proceedings, Redbox’s online streaming services and mobile app ceased functioning in July 2024.
Redbox Automated Retail LLC was initially developed in Chicago as a part of “Project 361”, aMcDonald'sbusiness expansion initiative. John Sexton Abrams, a strategy executive at McDonald's, designed the original concept as an immersive kiosk leveraging McDonald's product supply chain and geographic footprint to provide 24/7 access to fresh dairy and other products. Initially, the kiosks sold a range of goods under the name TikTok Easyshops.[7][8]In late 2003 McDonald's ended its use of the kiosks for the products. Instead, McDonald's executiveGregg Kaplandecided to use the kiosks for DVD rentals, which was tested in Denver in 2004.[9]
The company employed a "return anywhere" policy, different from competitors, which allowed consumers to return their rental to any Redbox kiosk, not just the one from which they originally rented it.[10]
In 2005,Coinstarbought 47% of the company for $32 million,[11]after unsuccessful attempts to sell half the company toBlockbusterandNetflix.[12]In early 2008, Coinstar exercised an option to increase its share to 51%,[11]before acquiring the remainder for $169–176 million in February 2009.[13]While traditional brick and mortar rental stores were closing at a high rate, Redbox moved into existing retail locations such as supermarkets, and placed kiosks within them or outside of them to gain access to that consumer base.[14]
Competitors included Netflix, Blockbuster,Movie Galleryand its subsidiaryHollywood Video,West Coast Video, andFamily Videoalong with otherDVD by mailrental services.Mitch Lowejoined Redbox in 2003 after spending five years as an executive at Netflix. At Redbox, he started first as a consultant and then as VP of Purchasing & Operations. In 2005, he became the Chief Operating Officer.[15]Lowe owned and operated a video rental company named Video Droid from 1982 through 1997. Video Droid attempted a VHS rental vending machine concept, though the idea was quickly deemed impractical.[16]Lowe was named President of Redbox in April 2009.
With growing concern in 2009 that DVD kiosks might jeopardize movie studio income from DVD sales and rentals, three major movie studios,20th Century Fox,Warner Bros., andUniversal Studios, each refused to sell DVDs to Redbox until at least 28 days after their arrival in stores.[16]Fox and Warner Bros. represented 62% of home video rental revenue in 2008–09.[17][18]Redbox responded byfiling lawsuits, first, against Universalin October 2008,[19]then against 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. in August 2009.[20][21]In August 2009, the federal judge hearing the Universal case allowed the antitrust claim to continue.[22]In October 2009, 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. filed motions to dismiss Redbox's lawsuits against them.[23][24]During that time, Redbox continued to rent films from the companies, purchasing them at retail from places likeWalmartinstead of receiving them from the movie studios, which in some cases saved Redbox money due to the discounted prices offered by retailers.[25]Other major studios—Sony Pictures,Paramount Pictures, andLionsgate—signed distribution deals with Redbox.[16]The Walt Disney Companypermits third-party distributors to sell to Redbox, but has not entered into a direct relationship with the company.[16]Both sides of the studio lawsuits pointed to these revenue-sharing deals to shore up their argument, with Redbox president Mitch Lowe saying, "our growth can lead to theirs [the studios' growth]. For example, Redbox currently estimates we will pay more than a combined $1 billion over the next five years to Sony, Lionsgate and Paramount to purchase and then rent new-release DVDs to consumers,"[26]while Warner Bros. says the deals are proof that far from being shut out byHollywood, "Redbox's business has thrived since its suit against Universal, underscored by lucrative distribution deals with Paramount Home Entertainment, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, and Lionsgate."[24]Redbox entered into an agreement with Warner Bros. on February 16, 2010,[27]followed by Universal[28]and Fox[29]on April 22, 2010.
In the agreements which settle the lawsuits, Redbox agreed to not make available for rental films from these studios until 28 days after their initial home-video releases. Redbox continued to sign additional and new distribution deals with these and other movie studios;[30]by 2017, titles from Fox and Warner became available on Redbox seven days after their initial home-video release.[31]
With over 6,000 kiosks, Redbox surpassedBlockbusteras the largest U.S. video rental chain in November 2007.[32]The company reached 100 million rentals in February 2008,[33]and passed 1 billion rentals in September 2010.[34]As of Q2 2011, 68% of the U.S. population lived within a five-minute drive of a Redbox kiosk.[35]In Q2 2011, kiosks accounted for 36% of the disc rental market, with 38% of that attributable to rent-by-mail services and 25% to traditional stores, according to theNPD Group.
Redbox announced in July 2010 that they would introduceBlu-raymovies at 13,000 kiosks; by that fall, Blu-ray discs were available across the Redbox network.[36]In October 2010, the company began offering video game rentals in select markets, includingReno, Nevada;Orlando, Florida;Stevens Point, Wisconsin;Austin, Texas;Wilmington, North Carolina; andCorvallis, Oregon.[citation needed]Video games were available at all Redbox locations by June 2011.[37]In February 2012, Redbox announced the acquisition of Blockbuster Express, a competing kiosk-based rental service operated byNCRin partnership with Blockbuster. The $100 million purchase, completed on June 27, 2012, included over 10,000 kiosks, inventory, and certain retailer contracts.[38][39]As part of the agreement, Redbox entered a supplier arrangement of purchasing product and services from NCR.[40]The company sold some Blockbuster Express kiosks in less competitive markets to third party providers in June 2013.[41]Also in 2012, Redbox partnered withNew Era Ticketsand Sparkart to test sales of live event tickets at Redbox kiosks. Redbox Tickets launched in October 2012 inGreater Philadelphia,[42][43]and later expanded to theLos Angelesarea in early 2013.[44]
Redbox announced its 3 billionth disc rental, including both movies and games, in July 2013.[45]The number of items rented from kiosks annually peaked in 2013, with 772.87 million rentals creating $1.97 billion in revenue; that year, Redbox rentals comprised more than 50% of DVD rentals in the United States[6][46]with 717.13 million units rented in 2014, and 587.55 million in 2015.[47]This decline was widely attributed to consumers' preferences shifting from physical media to online streaming; although as of 2014, Redbox still represented half of the physical media rental market.[48]
Redbox began offering rentals inCanadain mid-2012.[49]1,400 kiosks were installed in Canada before Redbox ended operations in the country in March 2015, citing low demand. These kiosks were subsequently relocated to retail stores in the United States.[50][51]
In August 2012, Redbox's founder, Gregg Kaplan, exited as president and COO of Redbox, and was succeeded as president by Anne Saunders.[52]Throughout most of 2016, parent company Outerwall was seeking a buyer based on shareholder input. In early September, Outerwall was sold toApollo Global Managementand its three units (Coinstar,ecoATMand Redbox) were split into separate operating companies. In late September 2016, Outerwall CFO Galen Smith was announced as the new CEO of Redbox.[53]
In January 2017, Redbox began moving some of its then-40,000 kiosks, with the intention of analyzing consumer trends and reacting to under-performing neighborhoods.[54][55]On December 13, 2017, Redbox offered a newvideo streamingservice called Redbox On Demand.[56]The percentage of consumers renting or purchasing movies from Redbox rose in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the third quarter, according to a TiVo survey.[57]That month, Disney sued Redbox, accusing them of violating copyrights by selling codes to download Disney movies such asStar Wars: The Force AwakensandBeauty and the Beast.[58]
In April 2018, Redbox acquired the independent filmBenjaminfor a 90-day release period via its kiosks and on demand service, as the first Redbox Original.[59]In October 2019 Redbox formed a film and TV series production division, Redbox Entertainment, with Marc Danon as senior advisor of content acquisition.[60]Redbox announced on December 9, 2019, that it would no longer be renting video games but will continue selling used video game copies through the end of the year.[61]
Redbox Free Live TV, afree ad-supported streaming televisionservice, was soft launched in early February 2020 with a nationwide launch on February 18.[62]The company's revenue fell 20% in 2019, 36% in 2020 and over 50% in 2021.[63]On May 17, 2021, Redbox announced that it reached a definitive agreement to merge with Seaport Global Acquisition, aspecial-purpose acquisition companywhich would result in Redbox being publicly listed on theNasdaqunder the ticker RDBX.[64]The company officially went public on October 25, 2021.[65]
On May 11, 2022,Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainmentannounced its intention to acquire Redbox for $375 million.[66]The acquisition was completed on August 11, 2022, less than a year after Redbox went public.[67]At the end of 2022, the company operated about 34,000 kiosks nationwide, with plans to increase that number with 1,000 more kiosks in 2023.[68]In July 2023, CSSE announced a partnership with the video sharing platformTikTok, under which screens showcasing top content from the service will be installed on at least 3,000 Redbox kiosks. These ads will also display advertising sold by Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment's sales platform Crackle Connex.[69]
In August 2023, convenience store chain7-Eleventerminated its contract with Redbox due to its failure to pay commissions and demanded the kiosks be removed; Redbox failed to do so. Franchisees began to unplug machines and tape credit card readers shut. 7-Eleven eventually filed a lawsuit in June 2024.[70]In February 2024, drug store chainCVSfiled a lawsuit against Redbox for failure to pay commissions during the third quarter of 2022. Convenience store chainSheetzfollowed suit the same month for not receiving payments since the end of 2022.[70]
On April 23, 2024, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment announced a $636.6 million loss in 2023, and warned that without any options to generate additional financing, the company could be forced to liquidate or pause operations, and seek a potentialChapter 11 bankruptcyprotection filing. However, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment did also report that Redbox's sales increased last year, seeing a 66% increase in annual revenue to $112.7 million.[71]
By June 15, all Redbox kiosks inHannafordgrocery stores had been shut down.[72]On June 29, 2024, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after missing a week of paying its employees and failing to secure financing.[73]On July 10, 2024, a bankruptcy judge ordered to convert Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment's Chapter 11 bankruptcy into aChapter 7 bankruptcyliquidation after accusing the company's previous CEO of misusing the business and failing to pay employees or support healthcare. With the Chapter 7 conversion, the company's assets will be liquidated, resulting in the shut down of its subsidiaries, including Redbox. In addition, over 1,000 employees will be laid off. The company's website and apps were taken down shortly after.[74][75][76]
Although many of Redbox’s kiosks have been removed, many remaining kiosks are still functional and dispense discs. Some kiosks have been taken by hobbyists and tinkerers who aim toreverse engineerthe software used by them.[77][78]A major company involved in the removal and disposal of Redbox kiosks is The Junkluggers, although most kiosks are removed by independent contractors.[79]The Junkluggers aim to recycle the metal used by the kiosks and donate the DVDs inside to community organizations.[79]
Redbox's vending kiosks rent and sell movies onDVDandBlu-Raydiscs. Each stocked a selection of roughly 200 titles, with multiple copies of popular titles.[80]
Many Redbox kiosks were installed indoors, while others are located outdoors. They were usually attached to a large sign advertising a selection of featured films, and some locations feature two attached kiosks, allowing for additional selection and stock. Each kiosk was operated by customers via atouchscreen, and contained a robotic disc retrieval system with a stacked carousel capable of holding more than 600 discs.[80][81]Discs within are marked withbarcodes, allowing identification by the kiosk's machinery, and stored on the carousel in thin plastic cases, which are dispensed to customers via a small slot next to the control panel.
Rented discs could be returned to any of the company's kiosks. Charges accrued up to 25 days, after which the customer then owned the DVD (without the original case) and rental charges ceased. Customers could reserve DVDs online, made possible by real-time inventory updates on the company's website.[82]While customers could buy used DVDs from the kiosks (with unsold used DVDs returned to suppliers), Redbox estimated only 3% of the company's revenue came from used-disc sales.[83]
At its peak, a Redbox kiosk rented its average DVD 15 times at an average of $2 per transaction plus any applicable taxes.[16]
From 2010 to 2019, Redbox kiosks rentedvideo games. Initially games for thePlayStation 3,Wii, andXbox 360were offered;[37]titles for theWii U,PlayStation 4, andXbox Onewere added in 2014,[84]followed byNintendo Switchgames upon that console's launch in 2017.[85]
Redbox began in 2004, using re-branded kiosks manufactured and operated bySilicon Valley–based DVDPlay, at 140 McDonald's restaurants inDenverand other test markets.[86]In April 2005, Redbox phased out the DVDPlay-manufactured machines and contracted theSolectronfacility inCreedmoor, North Carolina—later purchased byFlextronics International, in October 2007 (Flextronics has been the manufacturer of theZune,Xboxand Xbox 360)—to create and manufacture a custom kiosk design.[87]The new kiosk was designed by Flextronics' Creedmoor design team including engineers Steven Hancock and John Rupert as key contributors under the direction of Franz Kuehnrich at GetAMovie Inc.[88](which was bought by RedBox). Other key contributors from Flextronics were Flextronics Global account manager Dave Stadelmaier and Global Supply Chain manager Ben Wheeler (The KioskGuy). Redbox was innovative[89]in that its carousel design not only decreased the number of robotic movements necessary to dispense and restock inventory, it also dramatically increased the number of discs (from 100 to 700+)[90]which could be stored within a kiosk. In addition, the software, designed and developed by Enterprise Logic Systems,[91][92]was also innovative in that it allowed RedBox to remotely monitor and manage inventory at all kiosks throughout the country.
In late December 2020, Redbox began offering a yearly subscription service allowing a subscriber to rent 12 or 24 discs in total, depending on their plan of choice. Only eligible movies could be rented on the plans. It extended the user return window until midnight, giving customers an additional 3 hours to return a movie to a kiosk.[93]
Retail chains hosting Redbox kiosks have included McDonald's,CVS,[70]Walgreens,Dollar General,[94]Family Dollar,Walmart,Market BasketinNew England,Krogerin addition to  subsidiaries inAlbertsons,Safeway,Meijer,[95]Winn-Dixie,Publix,HannafordinNew Yorkand New England,[72]Wegmans,[96]7-Eleven,[70]Cumberland Farms,Circle K, andSheetz.
Redbox began internally testing a video streaming service, dubbed Redbox Instant, in July 2012. The service was a joint effort between Redbox andVerizon.[97]On March 14, 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon officially went public, offering customers a free 1-month trial of an $8/month unlimited streaming service that includes 4 disc rentals from kiosks ($1 more for Blu-ray).[98]The service launched with 4,600 titles from movie companies includingEpix, Lionsgate,NBCUniversal, Paramount Pictures,Relativity, andSony Pictures. According to early reports, Redbox Instant planned to allow users to download content to mobile devices for offline viewing; titles could be either rented or purchased, in SD or HD quality, with rental customers having 30 days to begin viewing their title and 48 hours of unlimited views thereafter.[99]
In June 2013, Sony made the official announcement atE3(Electronic Entertainment Expo) that Redbox Instant would be available on thePlayStation 4console, and it was released in late 2013.AndroidandiOSapps also enabled streaming content on mobile devices.[100]
Redbox Instant disabled sign-ups for new users in mid 2014 owing to a growing number of people using the website to verify stolen credit cards.[101]In Q2 2014 earning call, Outerwall, Redbox's parent company, stated that they were "not pleased" with Redbox Instant subscription numbers.[101]Finally on October 4, 2014, it was announced that Redbox Instant would shut down on October 7, only 19 months after its initial launch.[102]
On December 13, 2017, Redbox offered a new service called Redbox On Demand. Like Redbox Instant, it is a streaming service, but based on a different model. It does not require any membership, and the list will contain new releases as well as several titles that it is claimed will never be available on services like Netflix.[56]The service launched with 6,000 titles for on demand rental or electronic sell-through in line with its kiosk operations. The titles come from themajor film studios' libraries except for Disney and Lionsgate.[103]
Redbox Free Live TV was an ad supported channel based video on demand service. The service was soft launched in early February 2020 with a nationwide launch on February 18. Nearly 30 channels were offered—three self-branded channels: Redbox Rush (action and adventure), Redbox Comedy and Redbox Spotlight, featured and recommended titles. The service's launch content partner was Lionsgate. Other content suppliers includeAmerica's Funniest Home Videos,Cinedigm,Comedy Dynamics,Fremantle,FilmRise,Gravitas,Jukin Media,Kabillion, Maverick Movies, People Are Awesome,TMZ, andUSA Today.[62]
Redbox Entertainmentwas Redbox’s content acquisition and production division.
On April 23, 2019, Redbox acquired the indie filmBenjaminfor an exclusive 90-day release period via its kiosks and on demand service as a Redbox Original.[59]In October 2019, Redbox formed its film and TV series acquisition division, Redbox Entertainment, with Marc Danon as senior advisor of content acquisition.[60]Then Redbox Entertainment exclusively picked up the distribution rights toAssailant,[104]which was released in March 2022, andVendetta,[105]which was released in May 2022.

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin. Since 1980, it has been struck in most years by theRoyal Mintfor sale to collectors and investors. Commemorative versions have been issued, such as in 2022, following thedeath of Elizabeth II; this depicted her son and successor,Charles III. (Full article...)

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
