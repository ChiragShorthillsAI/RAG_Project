The film starsRussell Crowe,Caren Pistorius,Gabriel Bateman,Jimmi Simpson, andAustin P. McKenzie. It tells the story of a woman who, while on her way to drop her son off at school, is fired by a client over the phone in rush hour traffic and is then terrorized by a violent and vengeance-obsessed stranger following a hostile verbal altercation with him at a traffic light. This leads to the rest of the day involving the stranger targeting the woman's family and friends as revenge.
Unhingedwas theatrically released bySolstice Studiosin Germany on July 16, 2020, and in the United States on August 21, 2020. The film was notable for being the first wide theatrical release in several months, due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, and grossed $44 million worldwide. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Crowe's performance, but felt that the film did not take full advantage of its thrilling premise.
One night,psychopathTom Cooper is parked outside of his ex-wife's house. He removes his wedding ring and then lights a match and a bottle ofhydrocodone. Tom grabs a hammer and a tank ofgasoline, breaks into the house and kills her and her boyfriend, and sets the house on fire. It explodes as he drives away.
The following morning, Rachel Flynn, a newly divorced single mother, drives her son Kyle to school duringrush hourtraffic. As she is running late to work, one of her clients fires her over the phone. She then honks at Tom's pickup truck, which is blocking traffic at a green light. He soon catches up to Rachel and tries to apologize, then asks for an apology in return, saying that he wants to "hit reset", and that "people should apologize for anything they do wrong". The exchange escalates when Rachel says that she has nothing to apologize for. In return, Tom promises to teach her "what it means to have a bad day". At the end of the road, Tom drives in front of Rachel and stops. He then drives away. Unsettled, she arranges to meet her friend Andy, who is also her divorce lawyer, at a diner.
Tom tracks Rachel to a gas station and switches his phone with hers while she is inside paying for her gas. Rachel sees him outside and gets help from a customer who accompanies her back to her car. The customer gets Tom's license plate number but is then rammed by Tom's truck, which leads him to getting hit and killed by another car. A chase ensues, during which Tom shows Rachel that he has her phone. He uses her daily planner to locate Andy at the diner. Before she can warn Andy, Tom beats and stabs him to death in front of everyone while being filmed by a customer. Tom tells Rachel over the phone that she must choose another one of her contacts to die next. When he suggests her ex-husband, her mother, or Kyle, she names the client who fired her, then calls the police, who respond to the client's home while Rachel races to her son's school.
However, Tom has already arrived at Rachel's home, where her brother Fred and his fiancée Mary live. Tom confronts him, holding Mary hostage, before repeatedly pushing her into Fred's knife, killing her. He then ties Fred to a chair and tells Rachel over the phone that she has three minutes to go into the school, get Kyle, and drive away, or he will kill Fred, as he wants him to read a letter about how Rachel is a liar. Rachel desperately demands that the principal release Kyle. She gets him and drives away. When apolice officerarrives at Rachel's house, Tom sets Fred on fire. The cop shoots Tom in the shoulder and tries to put the fire out, but Tom escapes and catches up to Rachel and Kyle on a highway. They use aGPSapp on hertabletto learn that Tom is in a minivan (it is indicated that he killed someone for it), and is directly in front of them. When they attempt to alert a nearby officer, Tom rams his car, causing a multi-vehicle car accident.
Tom pursues Rachel to her mother's house where Kyle triggers a silent alarm and hides. Rachel rams the van that Tom is driving, flipping the vehicle. Tom gets out, attacks Rachel, and enters the house in search of Kyle, intent on killing him next. As Tom is about to leave, Kyle inadvertently alerts him to his hiding place upstairs. Rachel comes to and enters the house to protect Kyle, but Tom finds her and they struggle. When Tom begins to strangle Kyle, Rachel stabs Tom in the eye with a pair of scissors, killing him.
The police arrive and inform Rachel that Fred survived the attack. Rachel and Kyle leave to see Fred at the hospital. As they drive away, a car cuts Rachel off and she stops herself from honking at the angry driver. Kyle observes this and says, "Good choice." They drive away.

Guy Lodge ofVarietysaid the film "delivers exactly the nasty B-movie thrills you expect," and wrote, "The carnage is the point here, not any of the reasoning behind it, and Borte and Crowe bring it to a suitably frothing, furious head."[33]Writing forCTV News,Richard Crousegave the film two stars and specified, "Unhingeddistinguishes itself by keeping the pedal to the metal without providing anything new in the way of thrills. As a study of an emasculated man seeking revenge it brings to mindFalling Down,Michael Douglas' 1993 black comedy, exceptUnhingedis all darkness and no comedy."[34]
Writing forIndieWire, Kaleem Aftab gave the film a "D" and said, "For a film so reliant on the telephone, it's probably not a surprise that Crowe dials in his performance. Dressed heavy-set, Crowe is all grimaces and frowns in disgust at everything around him. His only emotional note is all ANGRY, resulting in a parody of his own performances. It's Crowe on overdrive, and it's horrible."[35]

The telephone incident had a generally negative impact on Crowe's public image, an example of negative public relations in the mass media, although Crowe had made a point of befriending Australian journalists in an effort to influence his image.[131]TheSouth Parkepisode "The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer" revolves around a lampooning of his aggressive tendencies. Crowe commented on the ongoing media coverage in November 2010, during an interview with American television talk show host and journalistCharlie Rose: "I think it indelibly changed me. It was a very, very minor situation that was made into something outrageous. More violence perpetuated me walking between the car to the courtroom with the waiting media than anything I'd done ... it very definitely affected me ... psychologically."[132]
In October 2016,Azealia Banksfiled a police report against Crowe, claiming that he choked and spat at her before proceeding to call her the 'n-word' during a party in his hotel suite. However, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office dropped the case in December. The following year during an interview withThe Breakfast Club,RZAacknowledged only Banks’ claim that Crowe had spat, though "on the floor" rather than at her directly, going on to condemn her alleged "obnoxious and erratic" behaviour.[133][134]Crowe asserted that he removed Banks from the premises because she had threatened to physically assault other attendees.[135]RZA denied hearing Crowe use the 'n-word' and confirmed Crowe's account of threats of violence by Banks, saying "(Banks) threatened to cut a girl in the face with a glass, then actually (grabbed) a glass and physically (attacked) for no logical reason. Russell blocked the attack and removed her from the suite."[136]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
