Brahms: The Boy IIfollows a young boy who, after moving into a mansion with his parents following a traumatizing incident at his previous home, finds a lifelike porcelain doll that he becomes attached to. It was released in the United States bySTX Entertainmenton February 21, 2020, and was panned by critics, many of whom deemed it inferior to its predecessor. The film was also afinancial disappointment, grossing $20million worldwide against a budget of $10 million plus advertising costs, less than a third of the first film's gross. It was alsoLakeshore Entertainment's last film before they were shut down.
After a traumatic home invasion, Liza and her son Jude are left deeply shaken. Jude becomes mute, and Liza suffers from nightmares. To heal, they move to a remote estate with Sean, who is Liza’s husband and Jude's father. While exploring the woods, Jude finds a buried doll called Brahms, which he becomes unnervingly attached to. Soon, strange events begin happening in the house, with Brahms seemingly influencing Jude’s behavior. Jude, who has been silent since the attack, starts speaking again, but only when he is alone with Brahms. Liza notices increasingly disturbing signs, including Jude writing new rules for Brahms, and drawings that suggest violent tendencies.
Liza grows more unsettled, especially after a violent accident involving a visiting cousin, Will, which seems to have been caused by Brahms. Despite her concerns, Sean and their therapist believe that Brahms is helping Jude cope with his trauma. Liza’s suspicions deepen when she learns about the mansion’s dark history and the previous family’s suicide. She also finds even more disturbing notes, indicating that Brahms wants to harm her and Sean.
One night, Joseph, the mansion's groundskeeper, breaks in and intends to harm Liza, claiming that Brahms "called" to him and revealing how the doll has influenced the actions of its previous owners. Shortly afterwards, Jude dons a mask resembling the doll and prepares to attack Liza. Sean intervenes, smashing the doll with a mallet, which interrupts its possession of Jude. To their horror, Brahms’ head shatters, revealing a grotesque demonic entity inside. A fiery explosion kills Joseph, and the family believes that they have destroyed Brahms for good after Jude tosses the doll into the fire.
The family returns to their old home, thinking the nightmare is over. However, Jude still keeps the mask and continues to speak to it, suggesting that Brahms still has control over him.

Benjamin Lee, writing forThe Guardian, gave the film one star out of five, describing it as "so punishingly dull to watch, filled with dry, perfunctory dialogue from Stacey Menear's consistently uninventive script and shot without even a glimmer of style," adding that "even at a brisk 86 minutes, it feels like unending torture..." with a finale "that buckles under the weight of its own stupidity, as well as some god-awful CGI."[17]

In August 2022, Bell stated he has plans for a third installment. The filmmaker stated that his intentions are to round out the character of Brahms, with the completion of a trilogy.

When discussing the future of the series, the filmmaker stated that hadJason Blumcollaborated on the movies, the third installment would have been released by the time the second was. Bell continued that the next movie will reveal that Brahms Heelshire survived the events at the end ofthe first installment, and that it will reveal what he has been up to; while expressing plans for the character and his doll counterpart to appear in the film. He stated: "...there's a lot of great stories and there's prequels. ...[It's a] rich world that lends itself to a lot."[20]

Holmes was baptized aCatholicand attended Christ the King Church in Toledo.[17]
She graduated from the all-femaleNotre Dame Academyin Toledo (also her mother'salma mater), where she was a4.0student.[18][19]AtSt. John's JesuitandSt. Francis de Sales, nearby all-male high schools, Holmes appeared in school musicals, playing a waitress inHello, Dolly!and Lola inDamn Yankees.[20]She scored 1310 out of 1600 on herSATand was accepted toColumbia University(and attended for a summer session);[12][18]her father wanted her to become a doctor.[19]
At age 14, she began classes at a modeling school in Toledo which led her to theInternational Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA)Competition held in New York City in 1996. Eventually, Holmes was signed to an agent after performing a monologue fromTo Kill a Mockingbird.[8]An audition tape was sent to the casting director for the 1997 filmThe Ice Storm, directed byAng Lee, and Holmes made her big-screen debut in the role of Libbets Casey in the film, oppositeKevin KlineandSigourney Weaver.[20]
In January 1997, Holmes went to Los Angeles forpilot season, when producers and cast shoot new programs in the hopes of securing a spot on a network schedule. TheToledo Bladereported she was offered the lead inBuffy the Vampire Slayerbut she turned it down in order to finish high school.[20]Columbia TriStar Television, producer of a new show namedDawson's Creekthat was created by screenwriterKevin Williamson, asked her to come to Los Angeles to audition, but there was a conflict with her schedule. "I was doing my school play,Damn Yankees. And I was playing Lola. I even got to wear the feather boa. I thought, 'There is no way I'm not playing Lola to go audition for some network. I couldn't let my school down. We had already sold a lot of tickets. So I told Kevin and The WB, 'I'm sorry. I just can't meet with you this week. I've got other commitments.' "[7][20][21]The producers permitted her to audition on videotape. Holmes read for the part ofJoey Potter, thetomboybest friend of the title character Dawson, on a videotape shot in her basement, her mother reading Dawson's lines.[7][22]
The Hollywood Reporterclaimed the story of Holmes's audition "has become the stuff of legend" and "no one even thought that it was weird that one of the female leads would audition viaFederal Express."[23]Holmes won the part.Paul Stupin, executive producer of the show, said his first reaction on seeing her audition tape was "That's Joey Potter!"[24]Creator and executive producer Kevin Williamson said Holmes has a "unique combination of talent, beauty and skill that makes Hollywood come calling. But that's just the beginning. To meet her is to instantly fall under her spell."[25]Williamson thought she had exactly the right look for Joey Potter. "She had those eyes, those eyes just stained with loneliness."[26]WhileDawson's Creekwas met with mixed reviews,[27]Holmes attained national attention.[28][29]Holmes was soon on the covers of magazines such asSeventeen,TV Guide, andRolling Stone. Jancee Dunn, an editor atRolling Stonesaid she was chosen for the cover because "every time you mentionDawson's Creekyou tend to get a lot of dolphin-like shrieks from teenage girls. The fact that she is drop-dead gorgeous didn't hurt either."[30]
During her time as a series regular onDawson's Creek, Holmes's first leading role in a film came in 1998'sDisturbing Behavior, aScream-eraStepford Wives-goes-to-high school thriller, where she was a loner from the wrong side of the tracks. The film was recut from what the director intended.Roger Ebert, then of theChicago Sun-Timeswrote of her character, Rachel, "dresses in black and likes to strike poses on the beds of pickup trucks and is a bad girl who is in great danger of becoming a very good one."[31][32]Despite the fact that it received mixed reviews and was not a huge financial success, the actress won aMTV Movie Awardfor Best Breakthrough Performance for the role and also received a Saturn Award nomination for the part. Holmes, though, said the film was "just horrible."[19]In 1999, she played a disaffectedsupermarketclerkinDoug Liman's ensemble pieceGo.[33]The film received excellent reviews and made a profit, and Holmes herself was liked by critics. The same year, in Kevin Williamson'sTeaching Mrs. Tingle, which he wrote and directed, Holmes played a straight-A student whose vindictive teacher (Helen Mirren) threatens to keep her from a desperately needed scholarship.[34]Also in 1999, she had an uncredited cameo withDawson's Creekco-starJoshua JacksoninMuppets from Space, which was filmed inWilmington, North CarolinawhereDawson's Creekalso filmed.[35]
The year 2000 saw Holmes feature in two film roles. The first was inWonder Boys, directed byCurtis Hansonfrom the novel byMichael Chabon. The film told the story of a creative writing teacher at a university, withMichael Douglasin the leading role. Holmes had a small role (six and a half minutes of screen time) as Hannah Green, the talented student who lusts after Professor Grady Tripp (Douglas's character, who is her instructor and landlord). Many leading critics at the time took favorable notice to Holmes in the film.Kenneth Turanof theLos Angeles Timessaid she was "just right as the beauty with kind of a crush on the old man."[26][36][37]Her second feature film during 2000 wasThe Gift, aSouthern Gothicstory directed bySam Raimiand starringCate Blanchett, she played the antithesis of Joey Potter: a promiscuous rich girl having affairs with everyone from asociopathicwife-beater (Keanu Reeves) to the district attorney (Gary Cole), and is murdered by her fiancé (Greg Kinnear). Holmes did her firstnude scenefor the film, in a scene where her character was about to be murdered. Her appearance was lamented byVariety's Steven Kotler.[38]In Ohio, the scene met with disapproval from Russ Lemmon writing in theToledo Blade.[39]
Holmes hostedSaturday Night Liveon February 24, 2001, participating in a send-up ofDawson's Creekwhere she falls madly in love withChris Kattan's Mr. Peepers character and singing "Big Spender" fromSweet Charity. In the 2002 filmAbandon, written byOscarwinnerStephen Gaghan, Holmes plays a delusional, homicidal college student named "Katie". Todd McCarthy ofVarietyand Roger Ebert commended her performance,[40]but other critics savaged it.[41]During the final season ofDawson's Creek, Holmes played the mistress of the public relations flack played byColin FarrellinPhone Booth, which was both critically and financially successful. She also appeared asRobert Downey, Jr.'s nurse inThe Singing Detective(2003).Dawson's Creekended its run in 2003, and Holmes was the only actor to appear in all 128 episodes. "It was very difficult for me to leave Wilmington, to have my little glass bubble burst and move on. I hate change. On the other hand it was refreshing to play someone else", she said in 2004.[42]
Holmes's first starring role post-Dawson's Creekwas in 2003'sPieces of April, a gritty comedy about adysfunctional familyonThanksgiving. Many critics and audiences agreed that Holmes had given her best performance in the film as April.Varietysaid it was "one of her best film performances."[43]"Each actor shines", wroteElvis Mitchell, "even Ms. Holmes, whose beauty seems to have fogged the minds of her previous directors" in playing "a brat who is slaving to find her inner decency and barely has the equipment for such an achievement, let alone to serve a meal whose salmonella potential could claim an entire borough. Yet it is her surliness, as well as her intransigent determination to make Thanksgiving work, that keeps the laughs coming."[44]Holmes also received aSatellite Awardfor Best Actress for the role. On the November 9, 2003 episode, she wasPunk'dbyAshton Kutcherand the next year she was the subject of an episode of the MTV programDiary.[45]

Kirk Honeycutt called her character Samantha Mackenzie "a startling example of how a studio film can dumb down and neutralize the comic abilities of a lively young star."[47]In the 2005 filmBatman Beginsshe playedRachel Dawes, an attorney in the Gotham City district attorney's office and the childhood sweetheart of the title character.Varietywas unenthusiastic. "Holmes is OK", was its critic's sole remark on her performance.[48]She was nominated for aGolden Raspberryfor "worst supporting actress" for the film.[49]

"Usually I'm not even in the top ten", she said, the highest-grossing film of her career then beingPhone Booth.[5]She lamented "It's not like I have a lot of stuff that's great just waiting for me to sign on to."[50]She also appeared in the film version ofChristopher Buckley's satirical novelThank You for Smoking, about a tobacco lobbyist played byAaron Eckhart, whom Holmes's character, a Washington reporter, seduces.Varietywrote one of the film's "sole relatively weak notes [came] from Holmes, who lacks even a hint of the wiliness of a ruthless reporter" andThe New York Timessaid the cast was "exceptionally fine" except for Holmes, who "strain[ed] credulity" in her role.[51][52]The film ended up a success, even earning a nomination for theGolden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Also in 2005, Holmes had agreed to play inShame on You, abiopicabout the country singerSpade Cooleywritten and directed byDennis Quaid, as the wife whom Cooley (played by Quaid) stomps to death.

The film flopped.[57]The Canadian Presscriticized Holmes's performance, "While Keaton has long done zany and giddy well, and she and Latifah have an interesting contrast of personalities, Holmes' presence feels like an afterthought."[58]The New York TimesandVarietyalso criticized Holmes's performance in the film, with the former calling her "the movie's weakest link".[59][60]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
