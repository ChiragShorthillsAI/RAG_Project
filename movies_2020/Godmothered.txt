In a magical place called the Motherland,fairy godmotherstrain so that they can help people's wishes come true. Among them is the youngest, and only fairy who is not elderly, Eleanor Bloomingbottom who gleefully commits to the craft despite not being very good at it. The godmothers stick to a "formula" that many have grown bored with (i.e., true love, castle, etc.). Eleanor learns from another godmother that the school is to be shut down, as nobody makes wishes anymore, and that they will have to learn to betooth fairiesinstead. Determined, Eleanor checks the assignment room and discovers a letter from a 10-year-old girl named Mackenzie Walsh and decides to help her. She is aided by the oldest student, Agnes, who warns her that if she is found out, the school will shut down and, worse, her powers will be stripped.
Eleanor ends up in the real world where a friendly trucker takes her toBoston, where to her shock and dismay, Mackenzie is now a miserable 40-year-old single mother who works at a failing television station that reports onpuff pieces. She manages to convince her that she is a fairy godmother by displaying her magic and Mackenzie is forced to take her home to her two daughters, Mia and Jane, and her sister Paula, who helps with looking after the kids. Mackenzie has trouble raising her children as Jane hassocial anxietywhen it comes to singing, which she needs to do for her high school. Eleanor is forced to sleep in the basement and comes to believe, based on a comment Mackenzie made, that her husband ran away.
Eleanor begins affecting the family's lives when she starts tagging along with Mackenzie to work and meets her coworkers Duff and Hugh Prince, the latter of whom has feelings for Mackenzie, much to Eleanor's delight. Eleanor accidentally creates a colorful explosion in the sky and later creates a citywide blackout. She becomes aviralsensation following asleddingaccident, the latter of which gives the news station higher ratings. Eleanor learns from Mia that Mackenzie's husband died and realizes that it is connected to Jane's anxiety and helps her by having her sing "My Favorite Things" in public. Meanwhile, Mackenzie's newfound optimism convinces her to undergo a makeover and she begins hanging out with Hugh more; himself a divorced father with a son.
Agnes tells Eleanor that she will lose her powers, should she fail to have Mackenzie's true love found by midnight the next night. She convinces Mackenzie to attend a party being thrown by their unscrupulous boss Grant and attempts to use her powers to make her fall in love with Hugh. This fails and Mackenzie berates her for trying to impede on her life. Their argument is heard by everyone at the party with Grant believing that all the recent stories were planned. Mackenzie tells Eleanor to leave, though Paula finds her fairy godmother book and sets out to look for her. To Mackenzie's surprise, Grant wants Eleanor back to exploit her. When Mackenzie refuses, Grant fires her and Hugh quits after revealing that he was offered another job.
Mackenzie learns that Jane still has anxiety, as she needs to sing for the high school at the Christmas festival that night. They find Paula trying to help Eleanor create a pumpkin carriage. They tell her that they need her and she creates a watermelon carriage to take them to the show on time. Jane performs using her father's guitar to a stunned audience. Moira, theheadmistress, arrives to take Eleanor away, calling her a failure. However, Eleanor informs her that she realizes that the formula is dated and that everyone has their own idea of true love. After encouragement from the Walshes and the audience, Moira concedes that Eleanor was a success and the two of them head back with the assignment completed.
In theepilogue, rendered intraditional animation, Eleanor has become a teacher in Motherland and is seen teaching new children godmothers the new way.

Filming forGodmotheredwrapped by April 2020.[7]Weir and Ambudkar improvised heavily during filming, with many of their scenes ending up in the final cut.[8]
Post-production forGodmotheredbegan by April 2020.[7]The film features an epilogue rendered inhand-drawn animationbyStudio AKA. According to Maguire, the idea of using hand-drawn animation was considered before filming, and later discarded. However, the filmmakers ultimately decided to use animation for the epilogue in response to theCOVID-19 pandemicshutdown, which left the filmmakers unable to film any additional footage.[9]40 Studio AKA animators worked remotely on the sequence under the supervision of supervising animator Aya Suzuki.[10]While the characters were hand-drawn animated, the sets were created through CG.[10]The animators sought for the epilogue to "feel very much in the tradition of Disney animation" while also feeling unique.[10]Animators were inspired by early Disney films for the staging, colour, and lighting, while also adding texture to give the animation a storybook film, as the sequence opened with a book.[10]Several designs were made for Eleanor, who had to fit the epilogue's cartoonish look while also resembling Jilian Bell.[10]The animators started by working on rough animation in order to get performance approval, before being set to clean up for coloring and texture.[10]

Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on 72 critic reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "More bippity boppity than boo,Godmotheredtweaks fairytale conventions with just enough self-aware humor to overcome a disappointing deficit of genuine magic."[13]OnMetacritic, it has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[14]
Alonso Duralde ofTheWrappraised the humor of the movie and the emotional weight across its ending, complimented the visual effects, and applauded the chemistry between Jillian Bell and Isla Fisher, writing "Younger viewers are more likely to find “Godmothered” enchanting, but there's enough good cheer (and smart messaging) for willing adults as well."[15]Nick Allen ofRogerEbert.comgave the movie 3 out of 4 stars, praised the movie's humor, calling it a "charming family comedy", and complimented the performances of the actors, writing, "the cuteness ofGodmotheredis a winning one overall, especially in how it uses a playful sense of humor and good heart to find its own way to Happily Ever After."[16]Jennifer Green ofCommon Sense Mediarated the film 3 out of 5 stars and praised the film for its depiction of positive messages and role models, saying, "Godmotheredis a contemporary twist on the traditional Cinderella tale. [...] Whatwillstick is Eleanor's sweetness and humor and her total belief in fairy-tale concepts like princes, princesses, castles, carriages, magic, love, and happy endings. All of which get thrown into question in a lighthearted way that's meant to show kids that true love can come in many different forms and that happy endings aren't only about a man and a woman getting married."[17]
Robyn Bahr ofThe Hollywood Reportercomplimented the performances of the cast and found it to be an effective Christmas-themed film with a solid concept, but saidGodmotherednever really manages to surprise its audience, writing, "Godmotheredis pleasant enough, a cheeky and nostalgic Christmas-themed family comedy [...] ButGodmotheredwould have distinguished itself with more narrational novelty."[12]Natalia Winkelman ofThe New York Timesstated, "The film's idea is to re-examine and revise the fairy tale formula, and in some ways, it succeeds. [...] But for an updated princess story, Godmothered, directed by Sharon Maguire, is fairly conventional."[18]Kate Erbland ofIndieWiregave the film a C− rating, stating, "Sharon Maguire's family comedy has a good heart and a clever central idea, but there's no shine left on this Disney+ bauble."[19]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle. Its first film appearance was with the release ofStrange World.[60]The logo received widespread praise from critics and audiences and won Gold in the "Theatrical | Film: Design" medium at the 2023Clio Entertainment Awardsin November 2023.

I came in on the back of what was deemed as a big studio movie that had had extraordinary success".[21]She subsequently played supporting roles in the independent filmDallas 362(2003) and the Australian comedyThe Wannabes(also 2003). In his review for the latter, David Rooney ofVarietyfelt that Fisher "adds easy charm and a thinly developed hint of romantic interest", in what he summed as an "uneven but endearing farce about breaking into showbiz".[22]In the comedyI Heart Huckabees(2004), directed byDavid O.

On her part in the film, she remarked: "It was an interesting character to play, because she was so crazy and lacking in any kind of social etiquette. She doesn't care what anyone thinks." For one particular scene, involving sexual content, she used abody double. "I negotiated that from the beginning, trying to analyse why. I find pornographic violence, just gratuitous and unnecessary than nudity, because there's nothing more peaceful and beautiful".[25]The film was favourably received by critics and made US$285.1 million worldwide.[26]Empiremagazine found Fisher to be an "unexpected, scene-stealing joy",[27]and her performance earned her theBest Breakthrough Performance Awardat the 2006MTV Movie Awardsand twoTeen Choice Awardsnominations.

Describing on how she took her character, she said: "It was one of those situations where I read the script and thought, 'This is the take. I don't want to play the cliché femme fatale. I don't want to come in and be the woman with the sexual appetite, who wants to take down this man. I want to come in and make her this big beating heart, and innocent a woman who has no identity, who knows the man she's with, who doesn't have an agenda.' Because every character in the script has an agenda. I thought how interesting if my character doesn't have one if she's a victim of her own kindness. So, that was my starting point."[21]WhileThe Lookoutreceived a limited release, the film was favourably received.[31]The comedyHot Rod(also 2007), withAndy Samberg, saw Fisher star as the college-graduate neighbour on whom an amateur stuntman has a crush.

Every time I see [producer]Jerry Bruckheimer, I want to shake him and say: 'Are you mad? Why would you put me on a poster?'".[36]Upon its release, the film received lukewarm reviews from critics; whileTime Outdescribed her as "silly and adorable",The Christian Science Monitorremarked: "Isla Fisher is such a bundle of comic energy that watching her spin her wheels in the aggressively unfunnyConfessions of a Shopaholiccounts as cruel and unusual punishment for her as well as for us".[37]Despite the critical response, the film was a commercial success; it opened with US$15 million on its North America opening weekend and went on to gross US$108.3 million worldwide.[38]Fisher received her thirdTeen Choice Awardnomination.[39]
