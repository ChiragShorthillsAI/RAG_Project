Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made(also known asTimmy Failure) is a 2020 Americanfantasy comedyfilm based onthe book series of the same namebyStephan Pastisand produced byWalt Disney Pictures. It was released onDisney+on February 7, 2020, specifically based directly on the first book of the same name. The film is directed byTom McCarthy, produced by Alexander Dostal, McCarthy and Jim Whitaker from a screenplay written by McCarthy and Pastis and starsWinslow Fegley,Ophelia Lovibond,Craig RobinsonandWallace Shawn.
The film was removed from Disney+ on May 26, 2023, amidst a Disney+ andHulucontent removal purge as part of a broader cost cutting initiative under Disney CEOBob Iger.[4]It was, however, re-released on multipleVODplatforms on September 26, 2023.[5]
In a world whereimaginary friendsco-exist with humans, Timmy Failure is an 11-year-old living inPortland, Oregonwith his single mother Patty. Timmy runs Total Failure Inc alongside his own personal detective agency, and "solves" cases. Much of Timmy's adventures revolve around himself traveling with his imaginarypolar bearpartner Total (implied to be the result of his father walking out on him and his mother) across the city looking for cases and outwitting the "Russians" (actually just beardedhipsters). Among his small social group are his best friend, Charles "Rollo" Tookus, a former member of Total Failure Inc., who quit after a mission gone awry, and Molly Moskins, a perky and optimistic girl who has a crush on Timmy. Timmy considers his arch-enemy a girl named Corrina Corrina, who is actually very friendly to him and appears oblivious to his animosity towards her, though it is implied to be due to him having repressed feelings for her.
While retrieving a dead hamster from a classmate, Timmy's Failure-Mobile, aSegwaythat actually belongs to his mother, is stolen right out from under him. He cancels his other cases and recruits Rollo, who believes that the death of their class hamster and the stolen Segway are linked back to the Russians. At the library, Timmy learns from Molly that Corrina Corrina is part Russian and believes that she is behind the theft to dismantle his agency. Because of his unusual outbursts and behavior in class, Timmy begins seeing the school counselor, Mr. Jenkins, whom Timmy begins to slowly but surely trust with his mission. He also learns that Patty is dating ameter maidnamed Crispin who is friendly and aloof, but whom Timmy dislikes as he "[doesn't] collaborate with law enforcement."
Timmy learns that Corrina Corrina's father owns a bank and believes that his Segway is there. He and Rollo try to sneak in but get kicked out by security. Mr. Jenkins manages to get Timmy to do his homework as part of a "mission", but while doing so learns from Patty that they have to move to an apartment, which upsets Timmy as he has a "heavy caseload." While on a field trip toBonneville Dam, Timmy jumps to the false conclusion that Corrina Corrina plans to shut off the power to all of Portland. Unaware that she is still with the group, Timmy rushes through the dam to find her while being chased by his teacher, Mr. Crocus. They end up outside the dam just as the operators open the flood gates. Timmy tries protecting Crocus from the flood, as he considers him an intellectual equal, but it turns out that they are high above the flood gates. Timmy receives a three-day suspension for his behavior, and Crocus quits his job and is replaced while Patty angrily tells Timmy that she was fired because she had to stay home with Timmy, and shuts down Total Failure Inc for good as punishment. Saddened over his fate of having to be "normal" and moving to an apartment, Timmy lets Total go at the zoo.
Mr. Jenkins talks to Timmy and reminds him that he must learn from his mistakes so that he can be a better person. Invigorated after discovering a "Russian bug" in his cookie, Timmy recruits Crispin to liberate Total from the zoo. As they are driving back, they spot a purse snatcher and Crispin gives chase, catching him. Timmy considers aiding him but decides to simply call the police. After a passerby asks him and Total to move, acknowledging his presence, and Timmy subsequently accidentally backing up his truck into a pole, Patty comes to see Timmy in the hospital and he apologizes for his behavior. Patty tells Timmy that she wants him to re-open his detective agency. Soon after, Crispin shows Timmy that the Segway was impounded at the police station this whole time for being parked in a no-parking zone, convincing Timmy that the police are working with the Russians. Timmy comes out to give a speech at an animal fundraiser set up by Molly and excites the crowd with his speech on allowing polar bears into the school. As Timmy wishes that Crocus could be there, he suddenly believes that Crocus was kidnapped by Corrina Corrina and sets off with Total to "rescue" him.

The website's critical consensus says, "A fun, fast paced film for all,Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Madecelebrates the power of imagination with a delightful sense of humor and just the right amount of bears."[17]On Metacritic, the film has a weighted rating of 60 out of 100 based on 9 reviews, indicating "mixed or average".[18]
John DeFore ofThe Hollywood ReporterreviewedTimmy Failure: Mistakes Were Madepositively, describing it as a "charming" and "very funny film" that manages to be "the best of [Disney+]'s original programs by a wide margin."[19]Brandon Zachary ofComic Book Ressourcesreviewed the movie positively, stating "Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Madeis a ridiculously charming film, and one of the best in its genre. It isn't trying to be more than the fun and imaginative family film that it is, and that's perfectly fine when it's as well-crafted asTimmy Failure."[20]Clint Worthington ofConsequencegave the film a positive review, calling it as "fun and entertaining" movie that "works for kids and adults alike" featuring "series of adorable performances, from Fegley and the rest of the kids to the all-too-game adults."[21]
Jennifer Green ofCommon Sense Mediarated the movie 4 out of 5 stars, writing, "Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Madeis a misfit whose refusal -- or inability -- to be a "normal" kid will resonate deeply with some kids. Still, the film—based on the popular books—keeps the tone largely upbeat and humorous, thanks to the boy's outlandish plots, his unique imaginary friend (a bear), and fantasies (like the gloomy "Our Crusher of Souls" middle school), as well as an eccentric cast of Portland characters and settings, sweet friends, and loving adults."[22]Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comrated the film 3 out of 4 stars, praised the performances of the cast, and wrote, "To that end, it does start to feel remarkably episodic. [...] It’s a fun movie to spend time with, and I don’t think it needs to add up to much more than that."[23]Sandy Schaefer ofScreen Rantrated the movie 3.5 out of 5, stating, "Much likeSpotlightsucceeded in dramatizing a real-life story about journalism without sensationalizing it,Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Madeuses humor and a kid's way of looking at things to ground a tale about what growing up really means (learning to own your mistakes, realizing "normal" is a pretty useless term)."[24]

Walt Disney Pictures[2]is an Americanfilmproductioncompany and subsidiary ofthe Walt Disney Studios, a division ofDisney Entertainment, which is owned bythe Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer oflive-action feature filmsandanimationwithin the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at theWalt Disney StudiosinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWalt Disney Animation StudiosandPixar Animation Studiosare also released under the studio banner.Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesdistributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation ofTouchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one ofHollywood'smajor film studios.
Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongsideMarvel Studios,Lucasfilm,20th Century Studios, andSearchlight Pictures.Inside Out 2is the studio'shighest-grossing release overallwith $1.6 billion,[3]andPirates of the Caribbeanis the studio's most successful commercialfilm franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as theDisney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmakerWalt Disneyand his business partner and brother,Roy, in 1923.
The creation ofMickey Mouseand subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed asThe Walt Disney Studioat the Hyperion Studio in 1926.[4]In 1929, it was renamed again toWalt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success.[5]With the profits fromSnow White, Walt relocated toa third studioinBurbank, California.[6]
In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such asThe Reluctant Dragon(1941) andSong of the South(1946).[7]That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release ofSeal Island(1948), the first of theTrue-Life Adventuresseries and a subsequentAcademy Awardwinner forBest Live-Action Short Film.[8][9]
Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release ofTreasure Island,considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.[10]By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors asRKO Radio PicturesandUnited Artistsand formed their own distribution company,Buena Vista Distribution.[11]By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work ofL. Frank Baum.[12]
The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated asWalt Disney Pictureson April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[13]In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEORon W. Milleras film president.Touchstone Filmswas started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label.[14]That same year, newly named Disney CEOMichael Eisnerpushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief fromParamount Pictures,Jeffrey Katzenberg.[15]andFrank WellsfromWarner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone andHollywood Pictureswere formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.[16]
TheTouchstone Filmsbanner was used by then-new Disney CEOMichael Eisnerin the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western,Wildside. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit inThe Golden Girls.[17]
David Hobermanwas promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988.[18]In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president.[19]The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company,Mandeville Films.[19]In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position ofHollywood Picturesin 1997, whileDonald De Lineremained as head of Touchstone.[20]Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels.[21][22]The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairmanJoe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production.[22]As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.[23]
That same year,Nina Jacobsonbecame executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.[24]Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production.[25][22]During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, includingPirates of the Caribbean,The Chronicles of Narnia,Bridge to Terabithia,National Treasure,Remember the Titans, andThe Princess Diaries,and was responsible for establishing afirst-look dealwithJerry Bruckheimer Films.[26][27]In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairmanDick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing.[26][28]In July 2007, Disney CEOBob Igerbanned the depiction ofsmokingandtobacco productsfrom Walt Disney Pictures films.[29]
After two films based on Disney theme park attractions,[30][31][32]Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting withThe Country Bears(2002) andThe Haunted MansionandPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(both 2003).[33]The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive aPG-13 rating—begana film seriesthat was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017.[30][34]On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.[35]
In January 2010,Sean Baileywas appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv.[36][1]Bailey had producedTron: Legacyfor the studio, which was released later that same year.[36]Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEOBob Iger—and later studio chairmanAlan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued atent-pole filmstrategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in itsproduction logoandmarquee creditsto just "Disney".[37]Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of thePirates of the Caribbeanseries, with films such asJohn Carter(2012) andThe Lone Ranger(2013) becoming some ofthe biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with theiranimated films, which began with the commercial success ofAlice in Wonderland(2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history.[38]With the continued success ofMaleficent(2014) andCinderella(2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiateda trend of similar films, which followed withThe Jungle Book(2016) andBeauty and the Beast(2017).[39][1]In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.[40]
Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such asThe Muppets(2011),Saving Mr. Banks(2013), andInto the Woods(2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market.[1][41][42]By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.[39][43]
In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its ownstreaming serviceplatform.[44]The new service, known asDisney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures.[45]As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for thetheatrical exhibition marketa few years prior.[46][47][42]In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service.[48]These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million.[46]The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate.[47]Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions.[45]Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (Lady and the Tramp,Noelle,andTogo) exclusively for Disney+.[42]
On March 12, 2020,20th Century Familypresident Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, andexecutive vice presidentfor casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[49]In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated itscentennialalongsideWalt Disney Animation Studiosand their corporate parent company as a whole.[50]That same year,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destinymarked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.[51]
On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-ledSearchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell.[52]On February 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.[53]
Until 1983, instead of a traditionalproduction logo, theopening creditsof Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".[54]
Beginning with the release ofReturn to Ozin 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered withThe Black Cauldron.[54]The logo was created byWalt Disney Productionsintraditional animationand featured a white silhouette ofDisneyland'sSleeping Beauty Castleagainst a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed byJohn Debney.[55]A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movieReturn to Oz, although the film was released months beforeThe Black Cauldronwas released. An animatedRenderManvariant appeared before everyPixar Animation Studiosfilm fromToy StoryuntilRatatouille, featuring an original fanfare composed byRandy Newman, based on the opening score cue fromToy Story, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning withDinosaur(2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such asBrother Bear, the 2003 re-release ofThe Lion KingandThe Wild(the final film to use this logo) used this logo.
In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestat the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairmanDick Cookand studio marketing president Oren Aviv.[55]Designed by Disney animation directorMike Gabrieland producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation byWētā FXand yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish.[56]In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references toPinocchio,Dumbo,Cinderella,Peter PanandMary Poppins, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both theCinderella Castleand the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well asfireworksandWalt Disney'sfamily creston the flag.[57]Mark Mancinawrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo.[55]It was co-arranged and orchestrated byDavid Metzger. In 2011, starting withThe Muppets, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007.[58]The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases includingTron: Legacy,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Oz the Great and Powerful,Maleficent,Tomorrowland,The Jungle Book, andBeauty and the Beast.
In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's100th anniversaryin 2023, which premiered at the 2022D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created byIndustrial Light & Magicand an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed byChristophe Beckand conducted byTim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right.[59]A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting withChang Can Dunkbut returned with the international prints ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destinyin theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it includePocahontas,Up,Hercules,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,The Little Mermaid,Tangled,BraveandBeauty and the Beast, with the addition of Disneyland'sMatterhornfromThird Man on the Mountainand Pride Rock fromThe Lion Kingin the background beyond the castle. Its first film appearance was with the release ofStrange World.[60]The logo received widespread praise from critics and audiences and won Gold in the "Theatrical | Film: Design" medium at the 2023Clio Entertainment Awardsin November 2023. The standard version of the logo premiered theatrically withThe Beach Boys.[61]

Stephan Thomas Pastis(/ˈstɛfənˈpæstɪs/STEF-ənPAS-tiss;[2]born January 16, 1968) is an Americancartoonistand former lawyer who is the creator of the comic stripPearls Before Swine. He also writeschildren's chapter books, commencing with the release ofTimmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made. The seventh book,It's the End When I Say It's the End,[3]debuted at #4 onThe New York TimesBest Seller list for Children's Middle Grade Books.[4]
The son of Greek immigrants, Pastis was raised inSan Marino, California.[5]He started cartooning as a child; his mother brought him pens and paper to amuse him when he was "sick a lot" and had to stay in bed. He attended theUniversity of California at Berkeley, earning aB.A.in political science in 1989. The next year, Pastis attendedlaw schoolatUCLA, where he received hisJ.D.[6][7]He kept drawing during this time, coming up with the firstPearls Before Swinecharacter, Rat, during what he said was a boring class in law school.[8]
When I wrote for him [Rat] it seemed pretty honest. It was the first character where I could really say what's on my mind. When I put it on paper, it's my voice. So it works for me.[9]
From 1993 to 2002, Pastis was an insurance defense litigation attorney in the San Francisco Bay area, but he quickly became disenchanted with the legal profession. He did not like its adversarial nature or "the anxiety and tension it produced",[8]so in the mid-1990s he revisited his earlier ambition of becoming asyndicatedcartoonist by submitting various concepts to syndication agencies.The Infirm,[10]Rat,[11]Bradbury Road,[12]and others were repeatedly rejected.
The characterRatcame from Pastis's earlier strip,Rat. The characterPig, who is Rat's opposite, had been featured inThe Infirm, which was about an attorney who numbered an evil pig farmer among his clients. Although Pastis had developed the characters, they were still just stick figures with jokes. One day in 1996, Pastis drove to an ice rink in Santa Rosa whereCharles Schulz, the creator ofPeanuts, had his coffee every day. The meeting did not begin auspiciously, as Pastis blurted out: "Hi, Sparky [Schulz's nickname], my name is Stephan Pastis and I'm a lawyer." Schulz turned pale, thinking Pastis was there to serve him with a subpoena. But he recovered, and Pastis remembers Schulz's graciousness:
I was a total stranger to him, and he let me sit down at his table and we talked for an hour. I took a picture with him. He looked at some of the strips that I had been doing and gave me some tips. Man, I was on cloud nine.[5]
In addition toPeanuts, Pastis drew inspiration fromDilbert.
What worked for me personally was to study the writing of Dilbert. I just bought a bunch of Dilbert books and studied how to write a 3-panel strip. Then I showed them to a group of people who were acquaintances (but not quite friends) in order to get their honest assessment of which ones were funny and which ones weren't. As to the ins and outs of getting syndicated, I bought a book calledYour Career in the Comicsby Lee Nordling.[13]
Pastis drew about 200 strips for the new comic and selected 40 of the best, but fearing more rejection, let them sit on his basement counter for the next two years. Only in 1999, when he visited the grave of a college friend who had been a free spirit and had encouraged him to be the same, did he overcome his fear and submit the strips to three different syndicates, includingUnited Features. United took the unprecedented step of first running the strips onComics.comto gauge reader response. WhenScott Adams,Dilbert's creator, whom Pastis had never met, endorsed the strip, the response "went through the roof".[9]
Pastis also creditsGet FuzzycartoonistDarby Conleywith contributing to the strip's development. They met through their syndication attorney, and Conley taught him how to color the Sunday strips and add gray tones to the dailies, which people call "halftone".[9]
Eight months later, Pastis gleefully quit his law practice.[8]He considers his dissatisfaction with law helpful insofar as "humor is a reaction to and defense against unhappiness",[8]and wanting to leave his job gave him the impetus to create better comic strips so that he could get syndicated.[9]
Fifteen years later,Pearlswas still one of the fastest-growing comic strips, appearing in more than 650 newspapers worldwide.[13]Pastis generally works five to nine months ahead of deadline, a rarity in the world of newspaper comics.[14]
In June 2014, Pastis collaborated withBill Watterson, the creator ofCalvin and Hobbes, on a weeklong storyline in which a second-grade girl, Libby, wrote a few of Pastis's cartoon frames for him. Pastis says that collaborating with Bill Watterson is like glimpsing "Bigfoot". After the strips were published, Pastis revealed that the artwork for three of the strips[15][16][17]was in fact by Watterson.[18]In the last cartoon of the sequence, Libby explains to Pastis that she will not continue drawing strips, saying, "There's a magical world out there", a reference to the words Calvin speaks in the final strip ofCalvin and Hobbes.[19]
Pastis's first treasury,Sgt. Piggy's Lonely Hearts Club Comic, was published in 2004. In addition to the content of the previous books,BLTs Taste So Darn GoodandThis Little Piggy Stayed Home, and Sunday strips in full color, Pastis included responses from readers and a section in which he explained why certain strips were not successful, and how he would fix them. He continues to release the treasuries about one every year and a half. Each book in the series is subtitled "APearls Before SwineTreasury". Recently, treasuries became the main format for Pearls Before Swine books, retiring the smaller collections.
Pastis lives inSanta Rosa, California, with his wife Staci and two children, where he is on the board of theCharles Schulz Museum, helping with merchandising rights issues and answering questions aboutPeanuts.
Schulz is to comic strips whatMarlon Brandowas to acting. It was so revolutionary. Before "Peanuts", the writing was physical, over the top, but Sparky goes inside the soul. His influence on me is enormous. I've taken his backgrounds, the front porch, the beach and the TV beanbag. Rat is Lucy, Goat is Linus and Pig is Charlie Brown. Sparky is a template. Whether or not you know it, he's the template.[20]
In 2011, Pastis cowrote thePeanuts specialHappiness Is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown.
On February 25, 2013, Pastis released his first book aimed at younger readers,Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made, fromCandlewick Press. Modeled after the popularDiary of a Wimpy Kidseries,Timmy Failurefollows the exploits of a young detective-to-be and his polar bear friend, Total, as they solve crimes in their neighborhood. A sequel,Timmy Failure: Now Look What You've Done, was released on February 25, 2014. A third book,Timmy Failure: We Meet Again, was released on October 28, 2014. The fourth book,Timmy Failure: Sanitized for Your Protection, was released on October 6, 2015. The fifth,Timmy Failure: The Book You're Not Supposed To Have, was released on September 27, 2016. The sixth,Timmy Failure: The Cat Stole My Pantswas released on April 25, 2017, and the seventh,Timmy Failure: It's The End When I Say It's The End, was released in September 2018. A prequel to the series,Zero to Hero("Volume 0") (2020) is the eighth.[21]
In April 2017,Disneystarted work on aTimmy Failuremovie withTom McCarthydirecting and co-writing with Pastis.[22]The film was released on Disney's family-oriented streaming serviceDisney+in January 2020 with the titular character being portrayed byWinslow Fegley.[23]The film was shot from July to September 2018 inPortland, Oregon.[24]
Pastis was nominated for theNational Cartoonists SocietyNewspaper Comic Strip Awardfor 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008,[25]and 2014. He won the 2003, 2006, and 2014 awards.[26]He was also nominated for The National Cartoonists SocietyReuben Awardfor Cartoonist of the Year for every year since 2008, winning in 2018.[27]

Shawn was born on November 12, 1943, in New York City, to aJewishfamily.[3][4][5][6]His parents were journalist Cecille (née Lyon) andWilliam Shawn, the longtime editor ofThe New Yorker. He has younger twin siblings: composerAllen Shawn,[7]and Mary, who isautisticand lives in an institution.[8]His father's family had emigrated from Central Europe; his paternal grandfather, Benjamin W. Chon, was a Chicago-based cutlery merchant who married Anna Bransky.[9]
Shawn grew up onManhattan'sUpper East Side.[10]He attendedThe Putney School, a private liberal arts high school inPutney, Vermont. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in history fromHarvard College. He studiedphilosophy, politics and economics, as well as Latin, atMagdalen College, Oxford, originally intending to become a diplomat. He traveled to India as an English teacher on aFulbrightprogram.[11]
Shawn's early plays, such asMarie and Bruce(1978), portrayed emotional and sexual conflicts in anabsurdiststyle, with language both lyrical and violent. In a conversation withAndre Gregory, parts of which were used to createMy Dinner with Andre, Shawn said these plays depicted "my interior life as a raging beast." Critical response was extremely polarized: some critics hailed Shawn as a major writer, whileJohn SimoncalledMarie and Bruce"garbage" and Shawn "one of the unsightliest actors in this city."[12]His 1977 playA Thought in Three Partscaused controversy in London when the production was investigated by avice squadand attacked in Parliament after allegations of pornographic content.[13]Shawn received anObie Awardfor playwrighting in 1975, forOur Late Night.[14]
Shawn's later plays are more overtly political, drawing parallels between his characters' psychology and the behavior of governments and social classes. Among the best-known of these areAunt Dan and Lemon(1985) andThe Designated Mourner(1997). Shawn's political work has invited controversy, as he often presents the audience with several contradictory points of view. He has calledAunt Dan and Lemona cautionary tale againstfascism. Shawn's monologueThe Fever, originally meant to be performed for small audiences in apartments, depicts a person who becomes sick while struggling to find a morally consistent way to live when faced with injustice, and harshly criticizes the United States' record in supporting oppressiveanti-communistregimes. In 1997, Shawn discussed the political nature ofAunt Dan and Lemon,The FeverandThe Designated Mournerin an interview in which he talked extensively about the thematic connections among them, as well as his own views onMarxist,communistandsocialistpolitics, their relevance toAmerican liberalism, and how governmental and individual responsibilities for finding solutions to the dichotomy between rich and poor in the world take hold in his characters.[15]Aunt Dan and Lemonearned Shawn his second Obie Award for playwrighting in 1986,[16]andThe Feverwon an Obie for Best American Play in 1991.[17]Three of Shawn's plays have been adapted into films:The Designated Mourner(basically a film version ofDavid Hare's stage production),Marie and BruceandThe Fever.Vanessa Redgravestars inThe Fever(2004),[18]which first aired onHBOon June 13, 2007.[19]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
