Until they drive back he doesn't realize she is the same Miranda he came looking for. Bray and Miranda's son Greg fix the car bumper together.
Miranda's kids, Bess (the youngest), Greg, and Missy, want pizza for dinner, which Miranda cannot afford. Bray stresses the power of positive thinking just as a delivery person appears at the door with pizza ordered by Tucker. As Bray has never found the moment to give the envelope to Miranda, he leaves it in the mailbox before departing.
Ahurricanehits that night, washing away the mailbox and causing a tree to fall through the roof. Bray comes back to check on them, sees the mailbox missing, and offers to fix the roof as best as he can. Miranda and the kids leave with the kids' grandmother, Miranda's late husband Matt's mother Bobby, to stay over at her place while the house is fixed.
The next day, Tucker proposes to Miranda publicly at the restaurant's reopening, which she reluctantly accepts. Bobby offers to stay with the kids that night so Tucker and Miranda can be alone.
On the following day, at Missy's 16th birthday party, Bobby shows Miranda a news article about an invention with Bray's photo. The invention was also something Matt was linked to. Bobby assumes that Bray stole it from her son, so Miranda confronts Bray. He explains that he and Matt were working on it together but in the fateful plane crash he died and Bray survived. He tries to explain that his sole purpose in coming was to give her a copy of the patent. Miranda doesn't believe him and asks him to leave.
Bray sends another copy of the patent to Miranda, who realizes the money from it would solve their family's problems. The family finds the old mailbox with the original copy of the patent, confirming that Bray was telling the truth.

Holmes made her directorial debut with the 2016 filmAll We Had, in which she also starred, following in 2022, by her second movieAlone Together, which was also her debut as ascreenwriter.
Holmes's marriage to actorTom Cruise,[11]which lasted from 2006 to 2012, attracted a great deal of media attention. They have one child together, a daughter, Suri.
Holmes was born inToledo, Ohio.[12]She is the youngest of five children born to Kathleen, a homemaker andphilanthropist, and Martin Joseph Holmes Sr., an attorney who played basketball atMarquette Universityunder coachAl McGuire.[13][14][15][16]She has three sisters and one brother. Holmes was baptized aCatholicand attended Christ the King Church in Toledo.[17]
She graduated from the all-femaleNotre Dame Academyin Toledo (also her mother'salma mater), where she was a4.0student.[18][19]AtSt. John's JesuitandSt. Francis de Sales, nearby all-male high schools, Holmes appeared in school musicals, playing a waitress inHello, Dolly!and Lola inDamn Yankees.[20]She scored 1310 out of 1600 on herSATand was accepted toColumbia University(and attended for a summer session);[12][18]her father wanted her to become a doctor.[19]
At age 14, she began classes at a modeling school in Toledo which led her to theInternational Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA)Competition held in New York City in 1996. Eventually, Holmes was signed to an agent after performing a monologue fromTo Kill a Mockingbird.[8]An audition tape was sent to the casting director for the 1997 filmThe Ice Storm, directed byAng Lee, and Holmes made her big-screen debut in the role of Libbets Casey in the film, oppositeKevin KlineandSigourney Weaver.[20]
In January 1997, Holmes went to Los Angeles forpilot season, when producers and cast shoot new programs in the hopes of securing a spot on a network schedule. TheToledo Bladereported she was offered the lead inBuffy the Vampire Slayerbut she turned it down in order to finish high school.[20]Columbia TriStar Television, producer of a new show namedDawson's Creekthat was created by screenwriterKevin Williamson, asked her to come to Los Angeles to audition, but there was a conflict with her schedule. "I was doing my school play,Damn Yankees. And I was playing Lola. I even got to wear the feather boa. I thought, 'There is no way I'm not playing Lola to go audition for some network. I couldn't let my school down. We had already sold a lot of tickets. So I told Kevin and The WB, 'I'm sorry. I just can't meet with you this week. I've got other commitments.' "[7][20][21]The producers permitted her to audition on videotape. Holmes read for the part ofJoey Potter, thetomboybest friend of the title character Dawson, on a videotape shot in her basement, her mother reading Dawson's lines.[7][22]
The Hollywood Reporterclaimed the story of Holmes's audition "has become the stuff of legend" and "no one even thought that it was weird that one of the female leads would audition viaFederal Express."[23]Holmes won the part.Paul Stupin, executive producer of the show, said his first reaction on seeing her audition tape was "That's Joey Potter!"[24]Creator and executive producer Kevin Williamson said Holmes has a "unique combination of talent, beauty and skill that makes Hollywood come calling. But that's just the beginning. To meet her is to instantly fall under her spell."[25]Williamson thought she had exactly the right look for Joey Potter. "She had those eyes, those eyes just stained with loneliness."[26]WhileDawson's Creekwas met with mixed reviews,[27]Holmes attained national attention.[28][29]Holmes was soon on the covers of magazines such asSeventeen,TV Guide, andRolling Stone. Jancee Dunn, an editor atRolling Stonesaid she was chosen for the cover because "every time you mentionDawson's Creekyou tend to get a lot of dolphin-like shrieks from teenage girls. The fact that she is drop-dead gorgeous didn't hurt either."[30]
During her time as a series regular onDawson's Creek, Holmes's first leading role in a film came in 1998'sDisturbing Behavior, aScream-eraStepford Wives-goes-to-high school thriller, where she was a loner from the wrong side of the tracks. The film was recut from what the director intended.Roger Ebert, then of theChicago Sun-Timeswrote of her character, Rachel, "dresses in black and likes to strike poses on the beds of pickup trucks and is a bad girl who is in great danger of becoming a very good one."[31][32]Despite the fact that it received mixed reviews and was not a huge financial success, the actress won aMTV Movie Awardfor Best Breakthrough Performance for the role and also received a Saturn Award nomination for the part. Holmes, though, said the film was "just horrible."[19]In 1999, she played a disaffectedsupermarketclerkinDoug Liman's ensemble pieceGo.[33]The film received excellent reviews and made a profit, and Holmes herself was liked by critics. The same year, in Kevin Williamson'sTeaching Mrs. Tingle, which he wrote and directed, Holmes played a straight-A student whose vindictive teacher (Helen Mirren) threatens to keep her from a desperately needed scholarship.[34]Also in 1999, she had an uncredited cameo withDawson's Creekco-starJoshua JacksoninMuppets from Space, which was filmed inWilmington, North CarolinawhereDawson's Creekalso filmed.[35]
The year 2000 saw Holmes feature in two film roles. The first was inWonder Boys, directed byCurtis Hansonfrom the novel byMichael Chabon. The film told the story of a creative writing teacher at a university, withMichael Douglasin the leading role. Holmes had a small role (six and a half minutes of screen time) as Hannah Green, the talented student who lusts after Professor Grady Tripp (Douglas's character, who is her instructor and landlord). Many leading critics at the time took favorable notice to Holmes in the film.Kenneth Turanof theLos Angeles Timessaid she was "just right as the beauty with kind of a crush on the old man."[26][36][37]Her second feature film during 2000 wasThe Gift, aSouthern Gothicstory directed bySam Raimiand starringCate Blanchett, she played the antithesis of Joey Potter: a promiscuous rich girl having affairs with everyone from asociopathicwife-beater (Keanu Reeves) to the district attorney (Gary Cole), and is murdered by her fiancé (Greg Kinnear). Holmes did her firstnude scenefor the film, in a scene where her character was about to be murdered. Her appearance was lamented byVariety's Steven Kotler.[38]In Ohio, the scene met with disapproval from Russ Lemmon writing in theToledo Blade.[39]
Holmes hostedSaturday Night Liveon February 24, 2001, participating in a send-up ofDawson's Creekwhere she falls madly in love withChris Kattan's Mr. Peepers character and singing "Big Spender" fromSweet Charity. In the 2002 filmAbandon, written byOscarwinnerStephen Gaghan, Holmes plays a delusional, homicidal college student named "Katie". Todd McCarthy ofVarietyand Roger Ebert commended her performance,[40]but other critics savaged it.[41]During the final season ofDawson's Creek, Holmes played the mistress of the public relations flack played byColin FarrellinPhone Booth, which was both critically and financially successful. She also appeared asRobert Downey, Jr.'s nurse inThe Singing Detective(2003).Dawson's Creekended its run in 2003, and Holmes was the only actor to appear in all 128 episodes. "It was very difficult for me to leave Wilmington, to have my little glass bubble burst and move on. I hate change. On the other hand it was refreshing to play someone else", she said in 2004.[42]
Holmes's first starring role post-Dawson's Creekwas in 2003'sPieces of April, a gritty comedy about adysfunctional familyonThanksgiving. Many critics and audiences agreed that Holmes had given her best performance in the film as April.Varietysaid it was "one of her best film performances."[43]"Each actor shines", wroteElvis Mitchell, "even Ms. Holmes, whose beauty seems to have fogged the minds of her previous directors" in playing "a brat who is slaving to find her inner decency and barely has the equipment for such an achievement, let alone to serve a meal whose salmonella potential could claim an entire borough. Yet it is her surliness, as well as her intransigent determination to make Thanksgiving work, that keeps the laughs coming."[44]Holmes also received aSatellite Awardfor Best Actress for the role. On the November 9, 2003 episode, she wasPunk'dbyAshton Kutcherand the next year she was the subject of an episode of the MTV programDiary.[45]
Holmes was a contender for the role of Christine Daaé in 2004'sThe Phantom of the Opera,[46]but lost the role toEmmy Rossum. That year, she starred as the U.S. President's daughter inFirst Daughter, which was originally slated to be released in January 2004 on the same day asChasing Liberty, another film about a president's daughter, but was ultimately released in September 2004, to negative reviews and low ticket sales.First Daughter, directed byForest Whitaker, also starredMichael Keatonas her character's father andMarc Blucasas her love interest. Kirk Honeycutt called her character Samantha Mackenzie "a startling example of how a studio film can dumb down and neutralize the comic abilities of a lively young star."[47]In the 2005 filmBatman Beginsshe playedRachel Dawes, an attorney in the Gotham City district attorney's office and the childhood sweetheart of the title character.Varietywas unenthusiastic. "Holmes is OK", was its critic's sole remark on her performance.[48]She was nominated for aGolden Raspberryfor "worst supporting actress" for the film.[49]
In 2005, Holmes characterised her film career as being a string of "bombs." "Usually I'm not even in the top ten", she said, the highest-grossing film of her career then beingPhone Booth.[5]She lamented "It's not like I have a lot of stuff that's great just waiting for me to sign on to."[50]She also appeared in the film version ofChristopher Buckley's satirical novelThank You for Smoking, about a tobacco lobbyist played byAaron Eckhart, whom Holmes's character, a Washington reporter, seduces.Varietywrote one of the film's "sole relatively weak notes [came] from Holmes, who lacks even a hint of the wiliness of a ruthless reporter" andThe New York Timessaid the cast was "exceptionally fine" except for Holmes, who "strain[ed] credulity" in her role.[51][52]The film ended up a success, even earning a nomination for theGolden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Also in 2005, Holmes had agreed to play inShame on You, abiopicabout the country singerSpade Cooleywritten and directed byDennis Quaid, as the wife whom Cooley (played by Quaid) stomps to death. But the picture, set to shoot inNew Orleans,Louisiana, was delayed byHurricane Katrina, and Holmes dropped out due to her pregnancy.[53][54][55]After her daughter with Cruise, Suri, was born in April 2006, Holmes took a hiatus from her acting career until 2008.[citation needed]
After speculation about Holmes reprising her role inThe Dark Knight, the sequel toBatman Begins, it was finally confirmed that she would not appear. Her role was later recast withMaggie Gyllenhaalin her place.[56]Instead, Holmes decided to star in the comedyMad Money, oppositeDiane KeatonandQueen Latifahin 2008. The film flopped.[57]The Canadian Presscriticized Holmes's performance, "While Keaton has long done zany and giddy well, and she and Latifah have an interesting contrast of personalities, Holmes' presence feels like an afterthought."[58]The New York TimesandVarietyalso criticized Holmes's performance in the film, with the former calling her "the movie's weakest link".[59][60]
Returning to television in 2008, Holmes appeared in an episode ofEli Stoneas Grace, a lawyer. Her singing and dancing was praised by Tim Stack ofEntertainment Weekly.[61]Holmes made her Broadway debut in the revival ofArthur Miller'sAll My Sons[62]in October 2008. She opened to mixed reviews.Ben BrantleyofThe New York Timesclaimed "the neophyte Ms. Holmes" is a "sad casualty" of director Simon McBurney's "high concept approach" to the play. He adds that "Ms. Holmes delivers most of her lines with meaningful asperity, italicizing every word."[63]However, the New YorkDaily News'Joe Dziemianowicz took a more positive view of her stage debut, writing, "Holmes, a TV and film vet, makes a fine Broadway debut. Her rather grand speech pattern takes getting used to, but she seems comfortable and adds a fitting glint of glamour."[64]In 2009, Holmes appeared in theNational Memorial Day Concerton the Mall in Washington, D.C. in a dialogue withDianne Wiestcelebrating the life of an American veteran seriously wounded in Iraq, José Pequeño.[65]
