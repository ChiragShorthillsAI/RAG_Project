Blake works at a Skateboard shop run by Shred, while Sarah works as a school teacher. After two months, Randy is still there.  He finds a wild possum and captures it. Blake and Randy talk to each other and smokeCannabis. Sarah is annoyed by the issues and her father, Douglas Masters, does not approve of her relationship with Blake. Blake proposes to Sarah and she accepts, despite her father’s disapproval.
Six months later, Randy is still there and Blake and Sarah are fed up. Randy organizes an orgy, and when Blake tries to stop them he is drugged and destroys a gazebo shooting fireworks into the sky. Following the incident, Blake is arrested by corrupt cops, who are friends of Randy. A turf war starts between Randy and Blake. Blake assaults Randy and is arrested and bailed out again. The corrupt cops allow Randy to get a restraining order from Blake. Randy sneaks into the couple's house and injectsMDMAin their water bottles, altering their behavior and resulting in uncontrolled sexual activity which results in Blake getting fired. With more time on his hands, Blake hires a crew to bug-bomb the guest house, causing Randy to have to escape for medical reasons. With Randy gone, Blake and Sarah organize a quiet dinner in the backyard. Randy returns and releases a drug-addicted possum with rabies on them, and the group are bitten by the possum, leading to the need of rabies injections. One member ends up in the emergency room due to the severity of the bites.
Blake and Sarah organize their wedding in the backyard and, despite her father's objections, the wedding proceeds and the couple is married. Randy puts MDMA in their drinks, causing the wedding guests to behave abnormally and damage the home. Blake finds Randy hidden in the attic and attempts to beat him to death until Douglas stops him and beats him. Randy and Blake are arrested and Sarah bails Blake out. Sarah also reveals that she's pregnant with Blake's son.
Blake finds a new job and the two are separated until they are asked to return for questioning about the house. They find Randy and make peace, officially ending their turf war.  He explains that he repaired the home damages with money made from selling a priceless artifact from his collection which was worth millions. Randy explains that the house was originally owned by his parents and he had been preventing it from being sold because of his childhood memories. Randy shows that he has redesigned the guest house into a room for their baby and that he wants a family to live in the house.
Randy leaves, and the two newly-weds move in and start to raise their son in the house. They eventually get a video chat from Randy who is now partying on a yacht.

Troy Duffy(born June 8, 1971)[1]is an American filmmaker and musician. He has directed two films,The Boondock Saintsand its sequelThe Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day. Duffy was the subject of the 2003 documentary filmOvernight.[2][3]
Duffy was born inHartford, Connecticut.[4]He moved to Los Angeles in his twenties to pursue a music career with his band, the Brood. While seeking gigs, he worked at a bar where he wrote the script for the filmThe Boondock Saintsduring his break periods.[5]The inspiration for the screenplay happened one day when he came home from his job to find a dead woman being wheeled out of a drug dealer's apartment across the hall. Duffy then rented a computer and wrote the screenplay forThe Boondock Saintsbased on his disgust at what he saw:
"I decided right there that out of sheer frustration and not being able to afford a psychologist, I was going to write this, think about it. People watching the news sometimes get so disgusted by what they see.Susan Smithdrowning her kids...guys going into McDonald's, lighting up the whole place. You hear things that disgust you so much that even if you'reMother Teresa, there comes a breaking point. One day you're gonna watch the news and you're gonna say, 'Whoever did that despicable thing should pay with their life.' You think — for maybe just a minute — that whoever did that should die, without any fuckin' jury. I was going to give everybody that sick fantasy. And tell it as truthfully as I could."[6]
"I wrote [Boondock] in three sections. I wrote the very beginning and then I started thinking of cool shit for the middle. Then somehow between the beginning and the middle, the ending dictated itself."
The script featured two brothers inBostondedicated to killing Mafia thugs.
Duffy had completed the screenplay in fall of 1996 and passed it to a producer's assistant atNew Line Cinemato be read by a senior executive. The screenplay changed hands through multiple studios and Duffy was approached by multiple producers for the rights. In March 1997, he was contracted byParamount Picturesfor $500,000, and later in the month, Miramax Films won a bidding war to buyThe Boondock Saints. The studio offered $450,000 to Duffy to write and direct the film.[7]It was reported the script was worth $300,000, and the film itself was originally given a $15 million budget by Miramax'sHarvey Weinstein.[8]Duffy's band the Brood would do the soundtrack, and as a bonus, Miramax offered to buy and throw in co-ownership of J. Sloan's, the bar where Duffy worked.[9]
Filming ofThe Boondock Saintswas scheduled for the coming autumn in Boston.[10]Duffy sought to castStephen DorffandMark Wahlbergas the Irish brothers, though Wahlberg passed forBoogie Nights. The director also wanted to castBilly ConnollyandKenneth Branaghin the film, with Branagh playing the gay FBI agent.[11]Duffy also expressed interest in castingBrendan Fraser,Nicky Katt, andEwan McGregor, with two of them as the brothers, but no decisions were finalized. The director later soughtPatrick Swayzeto play the FBI agent, but Miramax preferredSylvester Stallone(with whom the studio had an existing relationship),Bill MurrayorMike Myers.[12]Before pre-production work was supposed to begin in Boston in December 1997, Miramax pulled out of the project. Producer Lloyd Segan said that the project had stalled due to casting and location problems.[13]While Duffy was able to keep the writer's fee of $300,000, the studio required the reimbursement of the $150,000 director's fee and the $700,000 advance to develop the project.
After being dropped by Miramax, still believing that the film was a hot commodity, Duffy convinced agents at the William Morris Agency to help him market it to other studios. Theindependent studioFranchise Picturesagreed to finance the project, for less than half of Miramax's original budget, once other elements were in place. Desperate to get the project rolling and convinced that it would eventually prove a major success, Duffy took the deal. Duffy approached actorsSean Patrick FlaneryandNorman Reedusto play the Irish vigilante brothers andWillem Dafoeto play the FBI agent.[12]Having found someone to back the film, filming began in Toronto, with the final scenes being filmed in Boston.[14]The name of Duffy's band the Brood was changed to The Boondock Saints, following the movie's release. The film featured two songs from the band: "Holy Fool",[15]which played during Rocco's tavern shootout, and "Pipes", which played during the credits.
After shooting, the film was shopped at the1999 Cannes Film Festivalin the hopes of finding a distributor, but every major American studio turned it down. After failing to find a distributor at Cannes, the film was eventually picked up by a small company for a limited theatrical release of five theaters in the U.S. for a period of seven days.
Duffy's rise to fame was chronicled in two documentaries:Off the Boulevard(2011), by Jeff Santo, andOvernight(2003), by Tony Montana and Mark Brian Smith.
Through word of mouth,The Boondock Saintshas grossed over $50 million in domestic video sales,[16]of which Duffy received nothing due to the structure of the contract he signed with the distribution company.  According to Duffy, neither he, his producers nor his principal cast got paid.  He sued Franchise Pictures and other undisclosed companies for royalties of the first film and rights to the sequel.  After a lengthy lawsuit, Troy Duffy, his producers and the principal cast received an undisclosed amount ofThe Boondock Saintsroyalties as well as the sequel rights.
After a number of years, Duffy directed the sequel toThe Boondock Saints, titledThe Boondock Saints II: All Saints Daywhich was released on October 30, 2009.  The film grossed $11 million at the box office (the film was released limited, never playing on more than 524 screens) and has grossed over $50 million in DVD sales (as of June 2012). The film had an $8 million budget.[17]
Duffy co-wrote the 2020 comedy filmGuest House, which was directed by Sam Macaroni and starsPauly Shore.[18]
The attention paid toThe Boondock Saintsand the fact that Duffy's band would be producing its soundtrack created a small but significant interest in Duffy's band the Brood, which had previously been ignored. The band consisted of Duffy on guitar and main songwriter, his brother Taylor on guitar and vocals, and two friends, Gordon "Gordo" Clark on bass guitar, and Jimi Jackson on drums. The members frequented severalNorth Hollywoodtaverns and were featured in the bar scene ofThe Boondock Saints.
After being courted by Maverick Records, the band eventually signed a deal in 1999 with a subsidiary ofAtlantic Records, which produced their first and only album,Release the Hounds, (Duffy having changed the band's name from the Brood to The Boondock Saints) which only sold 690 copies in total.[19][20]Jeff Baxterwas the recording producer. Jason Anderson ofAllmusicgave the album a mixed review (3 stars out of 5), stating the best material was reminiscent ofAlice in ChainsorBon Jovibut the album as a whole was bogged down by "thin production and weak lyrics."[21]
