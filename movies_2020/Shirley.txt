Shirleyis a 2020 Americanbiographicaldrama filmdirected byJosephine Deckerand written by Sarah Gubbins, based on the 2014 novel of the same name bySusan Scarf Merrell, which formed a "largely fictional story" around novelistShirley Jacksonduring the time period she was writing her 1951 novelHangsaman.[4]The film starsElisabeth Mossas Jackson, withMichael Stuhlbarg,Odessa Young, andLogan Lermanin supporting roles.Martin Scorseseserves as an executive producer.
Shirleyhad its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 25, 2020, where Decker won the Special Jury Award for Auteur Filmmaking. The film was theatrically released in the United States on June 5, 2020, to positive reviews, with praise for Moss's performance.
Fred and Rose Nemser are newlyweds relocating toBennington Collegefor Fred's job as a lecturer.[5]Fred is about to work forStanley Hymanwhile Rose, still a student, is already enthralled by the work of Stanley's wife,Shirley Jackson, writer of "The Lottery", the dark short story which shocked readers ofThe New Yorkerwhen it was published on June 26, 1948.
Minutes after their first meeting, Shirley asks Rose about her (not yet announced) pregnancy, saying "I'm a witch, didn't you know?" Soon after, Stanley asks Rose to help with menial jobs around the house because Shirley is struggling to write after suffering another bout ofagoraphobia. Fred and Rose reluctantly assent and move into the house. Rose realizes that she has unwittingly agreed to serve as the family housekeeper. She also sees the pathology of Stanley and Shirley's marriage: in his worship of Shirley's genius as a writer, Stanley enables her drinking and her lethargy; in turn, Shirley tolerates Stanley's posturing and pomposity, and she winks at his serial love affairs.
The Nemsers move into the Jackson-Hyman house. Shirley is deliberately dismissive of and even cruel to Rose, who has apparently given up on her studies in order to manage the household. Shirley begins to write again, announcing a new work based onPaula Jean Welden, a young woman who recently disappeared from Bennington's campus. Stanley is obsessive and controlling about Shirley's writing process; he asserts that she is a genius, but he wheedles and cajoles her to stay on task. Despite her initial harsh treatment of Rose, Shirley begins to think of the younger woman as somewhat of a muse. Shirley opens up to Rose, having her do research for the new book, including stealing the medical files for Paula Jean Welden. As the two grow closer, Rose falls more and more under Shirley's spell. She is enraptured by and protective of Shirley. A sexual flirtation builds between them, but is never acknowledged or consummated by the two.
In the meantime, the relationship between Stanley and Fred deteriorates as Stanley seeks to tamp down Fred's ambitions and to torpedo his career as an academic.
Rose's baby is born, yet Shirley remains wrapt in the cocoon of her writing; the arrival of a baby has little effect on life in the Jackson/Hyman household. Now feeling that the Nemsers have served their purpose, Stanley arranges for them to move out. Desperate to stay, Rose writes the name of Paula Jean Welden in a Bennington College library book and gives it to Shirley, hoping she'll infer that Paula had been Stanley's student and had been having an affair with him. To Rose's shock, Shirley is unaffected, saying that she's well aware of Stanley's love affairs and that she knows Paula was not one of his lovers. She also reveals that Rose's husband Fred is just the same as Stanley — that he too has been having sex with his students.
After confronting Fred about his infidelity, Rose runs off. As she walks along the road, with her baby daughter in her arms, Shirley pulls up next to her in a car and offers to drive her wherever she would like. Rose wants to see the trail where Paula disappeared. When Shirley arrives, Rose hands her the baby and then follows the trail into the woods. Shirley finds her at the edge of a cliff, where Rose is clearly weighing whether or not to jump. After a tense moment, Rose gives in and turns away from the edge. Her safe return home isn't a capitulation, though. When she and Fred finally drive away from the Jackson-Hyman house, Rose vows never to return to being a docile wife devoted to a life of domesticity.
Alone at last, Shirley allows Stanley to read her work onHangsaman. He declares it to be a work of genius. Shirley acknowledges his praise. It's obviously a familiar pattern in their peculiar partnership. The two celebrate by drinking and dancing — together and yet alone in their cluttered house.
On May 16, 2018, it was announced thatJosephine Deckerwas set to direct an adaptation ofSusan Scarf Merrell's novelShirley, based on a screenplay by Sarah Gubbins. Producers were set to include Jeffrey Soros, Simon Horsman,Christine Vachon, David Hinojosa,Elisabeth Moss,Sue Naegle, and Gubbins. Production companies involved with the film were slated to consist of Los Angeles Media Fund and Killer Films.[7]Martin Scorseseserves as an executive producer.[8]
Alongside the initial production announcement, it was confirmed thatElisabeth MossandMichael Stuhlbarghad been cast asShirley JacksonandStanley Hyman, respectively.[7]On September 6, 2018, it was announced thatOdessa YoungandLogan Lermanhad joined the cast of the film.[9]
Principal photography for the film began in late July 2018 inJefferson Heights, New York.[10][11]Scenes were also filmed atVassar College, which stood in forBennington College.[12]
It had its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 25, 2020.[13]Decker won a U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Auteur Filmmaking.[14]Shortly after,Neonacquired distribution rights to the film.[15]It was released on June 5, 2020.[16]
On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 87% based on 251 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Elevated by outstanding work from Elisabeth Moss, Shirley pays tribute to its subject's pioneering legacy with a biopic that ignores the commonly accepted boundaries of the form."[17]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted averagescore of 76 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[18]
Laurence Jackson Hyman, Jackson's son, criticized the movie's portrayal of his parents, noting that "If someone comes to the movie not knowing anything about my parents, they will certainly leave thinking that my mother was a crazy alcoholic and my father was a mean critic." He also expressed that, in his opinion, the movie failed to portray Jackson's sense of humor.[19]
Harper's Bazaarconsidered the film "a gripping, psychologically unsettling drama", noting it to be "loosely based on real life... far from a traditional biopic, instead playing on the horror tropes of Jackson's own work to lure viewers inside the author's brilliant but troubled mind."[20]
NBC News, stating that the film "captures the chills-down-your-spine feeling that Jackson's writing so skillfully masters" observed that "while many of the characters are real, most of Merrel's (sic) book is fictional, which might confuse the casual film-watcher" and noted that "the quandary of fictionalizing a real life is not new, and it remains an ethically weird endeavor"; "After watching "Shirley" there may be people who think Shirley Jackson was vicious, childless and incapable of keeping herself bathed and fed. And that is unfortunate."[21]
The Nemsers are fictional characters; the New Yorker observed that at the time depicted in the film (the writing ofHangsaman) Jackson and Hyman had four children, who do not appear in the film.[28][21]

NEON Rated, LLC,doing business asNeon(stylized inall caps), is an Americanindependent filmproductionanddistributioncompany founded in 2017 by CEO Tom Quinn andTim League, who also was the co-founder of theAlamo Drafthouse Cinemachain.[1]As of 2019, League is no longer involved with daily operations for the company.[6]
Its first film,Colossal, was released in 2017.[7]The company became known for distributing such notable films asI, Tonya(2017),Parasite(2019),Portrait of a Lady on Fire(2019),Palm Springs(2020),Flee(2021),Spencer(2021),The Worst Person in the World(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023),Anora(2024),Longlegs(2024),The Seed of the Sacred Fig(2024), andThe Monkey(2025).[8][9]

During the 4th Annual Zurich Summit, Tom Quinn commented on Neon's intent to release titles that appeal to audiences who "skew under 45, that have no aversion to violence, no aversion to foreign language and to non-fiction".[15]Explaining the success of the company in 2024, Quinn stated: "We were very much a startup, with everyone functioning as this sophisticated amoeba. We very quickly found ourselves that year inTorontowith a great slate [...] That work enabled us to sit at the table in Toronto that year and buyI, Tonya. Before the ink was even dry on the deal, we were planning itsOscar campaign. It's a testament to how quickly we can make decisions because we're not this big studio. We've always used that to our advantage."[16]
In September 2017, the company partnered withBlumhouse Productionsto manage BH Tilt.[17]In 2018, a majority stake of Neon was sold to30West, the media venture arm of "The Friedkin Group".[4][18]In February 2021,Bleecker Streetpartnered with Neon to launch the joint home entertainment distribution companyDecal, which is a standalone full-service operation that handlesdistribution dealson the home entertainment rights to both Neon and Bleecker Street's features. The first film to be distributed through Decal was the Bleecker Street releaseSupernovain winter 2021.[5]Additionally, Decal acquired North American distribution rights to the South Africanhorror filmGaiafor a summertheatrical release, marking their first ever acquisition.[19]
Andrew Brown (Co-President of Decal) oversaw the launch of Neon's home entertainment division. In 2022, Brown was promoted to "President of Digital Distribution". The exec, who has served as "SVP of Digital Strategy, Marketing, and Distribution" for Neon since 2017, also manages Neon's library, and oversees the annualFYC DVD Box Setanddirect-to-consumerdigital portal "Neon Cinema".[20]Prior to the joint-venture,Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, as well asThe Criterion CollectionandWell Go USA Entertainment(for the filmPossessorwhich Neon and Well Go co-distributed), distributed several Neon films onhome video.[21][22][23]
During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, Neon was approved to continue promotional activities for its films since the company does not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP) nor had encountered any issue in receivingSAG-AFTRAinterim agreements.[24][25][26]
In August 2023, Neon hired formerA24employees Alexandra Altschuler as "VP Media" and Don Wilcox as "VP Marketing".[27]That same month, Neon hired former Sierra/Affinity employee Kristen Figeroid as "President of International Sales and Distribution", Laurel Charnetsky as "VP International Acquisitions & Operations", and Dan Stadnicki as "Manager, International Sales & Distribution".[28]In May 2024, Neon hired Joey Monteiro as "EVP, International Marketing" and Ashley Hirsch as "Manager of International Sales and Marketing".[29]That same month, Neon promoted Elissa Federoff from "President of Distribution" to "Chief Distribution Officer" and Ryan Friscia from "EVP, Finance and Business Development" to "Chief Financial Officer".[30]Furthermore, Jeff Deutchman, who joined Neon when it was launched, serves as "President of Acquisitions and Production".[31]
Additionally, Neon has acquired the distribution rights to fivePalme d'Orwinners at theCannes Film Festival:Parasite(2019),Titane(2021),Triangle of Sadness(2022),Anatomy of a Fall(2023), andAnora(2024); all five won consecutively.[31][32][33]The company's strategy to acquire such titles at Cannes is to eschew "the lazy approach", said Deutchman. "The only real way to do Cannes is to go see as many movies as you can, because you never know where the nextDogtoothorBorderorHungerorForce Majeureis going to come from", he added, citing several modern Cannes standouts championed by arthouse buyers.[31]After acquiringParasitein 2018, Neon financed and distributed the film the following year in U.S. territories.[34]"From the very beginning, Tom Quinn sawParasiteas a universal film and refused to put it in a box as a foreign-language or international film", saidParasitedirectorBong Joon Ho. "He saw the heart of the film and understood that it was about all of us living in our modern class-based society. I was always grateful for that."[16]Neon spent $20 million promoting, distributing, and campaigning for the film's awards.[3]The film subsequently became Neon's highest-grossing film with more than $200 million at the worldwidebox officeand won fourAcademy Awards, includingBest PictureandBest Director. Similarly, Neon spent $18 million promotingAnora, three times the film's original budget.[3]Anoraultimately won the two aforementioned Academy Awards whileAnatomy of a FallandTriangle of Sadnesswere nominated for the same two categories, among others. As of March 2025, Neon has garnered 39 Academy Award nominations, winning 11 overall.[10][12][35]
In 2023, Quinn commented on the company's success at Cannes, saying: "We've seen over the years that each of these films, because of their credibility and success, the Palme d'Or has come to mean something quite impactful for a very young group ofcinephiles. And the reason why we know this is we've tested all these movies and dating back toParasite, probably I think, the fifth reason why people came to see the film, in itstest screeninginSherman Oaks, was the fact that it won the Palme d'Or, and each subsequent year that went up. And this year, the number one reason why people came to see the film [Anatomy of a Fall], at a test screening inBurbank, was the fact that it had won the Palme d'Or."[36]In 2024, Quinn stated: "The award means a lot. To audiences here who are looking for the absolute most adventurous, forward-looking cinema available, that award represents it because these films have delivered, and they've been major Oscar contenders."[16]
In July 2024, Neon received its biggest opening weekend at the box office with the horror thriller filmLonglegs, after scoring $22.6 million from 2,510 theaters (a figure that includes $2.5–3 million in Thursday previews) and only behindUniversal/Illumination's second weekend ofDespicable Me 4. Initially projected to gross $7–9 million, the opening marked the biggest total for an original horror film of 2024, one of the top 20 weekends for an independent film and the best opening ever for an independent horror film.[37][38][39]To promote the film, Neon utilizedguerrilla marketingtactics similar to those that led to the box office success ofThe Blair Witch Project(1999).[40]DirectorOz Perkinscredited Neon for the film's marketing, stating the studio "really responded strongly to the movie, the raw materials of the movie really excited them, the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it sounds. They asked me early on, 'Do we have your permission to kind of go nuts?' And I said, 'What else are we doing here? Go for it. Do your thing.'"[41]The film's total marketing budget was under $10 million, focusing ondigital contentand not havingtelevision ads.[37]During its third weekend,Longlegsbecame the company's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office, earning $58.6 million, surpassing whatParasiteearned with $53.3 million in 2020.[11]Furthermore, it became the top grossing R-rated horror film of 2024 and the highest-grossing indie horror film of the last decade, topping A24'sTalk to Me(2022),Insidious: Chapter 3(2015) fromFocus Features, and A24'sHereditary(2018).[11]Afterward, furthering their marketing campaign, from August 1 to 4, Neon (partnering withAtom Tickets) offered free tickets to anyone who has a birthday that falls on the 14th of any given month. To get the tickets, those who registered and purchased tickets through Atom Tickets received a special promo code after verifying their date of birth and were able to get one free ticket per customer, while supplies lasted.[42]

Films she has directed includeButter on the Latch(2013),Thou Wast Mild and Lovely(2014),Madeline's Madeline(2018),Shirley(2020), andThe Sky is Everywhere(2022). She also co-directed the documentaryBi the Way(2008) with Brittany Blockman.
Decker was born in London and raised inTexas. As a child, she played the piano and dreamed of being a writer, as well as a photographer forNational Geographic.[1]She graduated fromHighland Park High Schoolin 1999 andPrinceton Universityin 2003, where she aspired to become a conductor and applied for a conducting class.[2]She was inspired to become a filmmaker after watchingMonsters, Inc.[3]
Decker produced and directed her first short film,Naked Princeton, in 2005.
In 2008, Decker co-directed the documentaryBi the Waywith Brittany Blockman, which focused onbisexualityin the United States. Despite being described byVariety's Joe Leydon as a "once-over-lightly examination of an alleged cultural phenomenon",[4]the film went on to win the Alternative Spirit Grand Prize at theRhode Island International Film Festival.[5]
Decker wrote and directed her second short film,Where Are You Going, Elena?, in 2009. In 2012, she wrote and directed the short filmMe the Terrible, which Richard Brody ofThe New Yorkercalled a "wondrous short film."[6]
In May 2010, Decker attended the last day ofMarina Abramović's retrospectiveThe Artist Is PresentatMoMA. As she sat down across from Abramovic, Decker immediately disrobed and stood naked in the middle of the museum until seven security guards escorted her out over the museum’s no-nudity policy. Decker declared that her goal was to be "as vulnerable to [Abramovic] as she constantly makes herself to us."[7]
In 2013, Decker wrote, produced, and directed her first feature film, the experimental psychological thrillerButter on the Latch.  The film garnered praise from Eric Kohn ofIndiewire, who said Decker's career was "one to keep an eye on",[8]and Peter Debruge ofVariety, who wrote that "Decker has fashioned the kind of feature debut the film industry simply doesn’t support, but would do well to encourage: a visually poetic, virtually free-form groove in which emotion, rather than narrative, guides viewers through a young woman’s visit to a Balkan folk music camp."[9]Decker was included inFilmmaker Magazine's2013 list of 25 New Faces in Independent Film.[2]
In early 2014, she completed her second theatrical film, the experimental erotic thrillerThou Wast Mild and Lovely, starringSophie Trauband Decker's frequent collaboratorJoe Swanberg.[10]To raise money for the film's post-production,[11]Decker ran a crowdfunding campaign onKickstarterwith a goal of $15,500.[12]The campaign closed on August 22, 2013, having raised $18,517.[12]In his review, Kohn gave the film a B+ and commented, "Its labyrinthine characteristics suggest the unholy marriage ofIngmar BergmanandDavid Lynch. While nowhere near the same level of refinement as those giants, Decker concocts a wholly enveloping vision of isolation told with a grimly poetic style that wanders all over the place but never stops playing by its own eerie rulebook."[13]
In September, 2014, it was announced thatButter on the LatchandThou Wast Mild and Lovelyhad been picked up for a theatrical andVODdistribution byCinelicious Picswith a planned release set for November, 2014.[10][14]

Decker co-directed with Zefrey Throwell the 2017 documentaryFlames. AsDeadlineput it, "Shot over the course of five years, the project charts the immensely passionate and profound relationship between the two artists, watching the spectacular romance, excitement and adventure of their relationship at its peak, and the fallout as Decker and Throwell clash, falling out of love with each other."[16]
Decker’s third feature film,Madeline's Madeline, screened at theSundanceandBerlinfilm festivals in early 2018.[17][18]It featuresMolly ParkerandMiranda July, and introduces 19-year-oldHelena Howardas a troubled acting student whose "class exercises become increasingly immersive and personal".[18]
In 2020,Neondistributed Decker's featureShirley, inspired by the life of authorShirley Jackson. The film starredElisabeth MossandMichael Stuhlbarg, and was produced byChristine Vachonand executive produced byMartin Scorsese.[19]OnRogerEbert.com, critic Sheila O'Malley called it Decker's "most ambitious film to date."[20]
In a change of pace, Decker directed the coming-of-age dramaThe Sky is Everywhere, which was released in 2022 byApple+andA24.[21]In an interview, Decker said, "I think I was really ready to make something that was a little lighter and had more lightness and less gritty, dark, violent, sexual. Probably for my next movie, I’ll go back into it hard, but this was a nice little respite."[22]
Decker citesAntichrist,Days of Heaven,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, andSilent Lightas her primary influences, as well as the novelEast of Eden, directorJoe Swanberg, and frequent collaboratorSarah Small. She citedBlack Swanas a particular influence onButter on the Latch.[23]

It required Zoey to be a bit of a pain with her fancy French boyfriend, but Moss always made her relatable, even when the plot required otherwise."[11]
In 2002, Moss appeared in a commercial forExcedrinin which she directly addressed the audience about the medication's benefits for people who suffer frommigraines.

Film critic Manhola Dargis ofThe New York Timeswrote of her performance, "Ms. Moss, an amazing actress fast breaking free of the limits imposed on her byMad Men...[Here] she creates a complex portrait of a woman tested by love whose smiles work like a barricade until fissures of feeling break down her last defenses. Ms. Moss lifts her and this movie with supple and steely grace."[28]In September 2014, it was announced that Moss would star on Broadway as Heidi Holland inThe Heidi Chronicles.[29]The play opened on March 19, 2015, atThe Music Box Theatre.[30]Though the play received some positive reviews,[30]it closed on May 3, 2015, due to low ticket sales.[31]Charles IsherwoodofThe New York Timespraised her writing "Ms. Moss, a superb actor who possesses an unusual ability to project innocence and smarts at the same time" adding, "Moss puts her own distinctive stamp on the part".[32]For her performance she was nominated for aTony Award for Best Actress in a Play.[33]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
