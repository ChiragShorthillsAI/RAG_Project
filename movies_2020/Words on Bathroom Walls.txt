Words on Bathroom Wallswas released on August 21, 2020, byRoadside Attractions.[4][5]It received generally positive reviews from critics.
After apsychotic breakcauses him to accidentally burn a classmate’s arm, high school senior Adam Petrazelli is then diagnosed withschizophrenia. He first self-treats by intensely focusing on cooking, which calms him. His symptoms - chiefly hallucinations of three people - worsen until he is put on adrug trial. At stressful times, his three regular "visitors" are Rebecca, aNew Agehippie; Joaquin, the smutty best friend; and the overprotective and often violent "The Bodyguards"; as well as a "dark" threatening voice that represents Adam's fears of the unknown.
Adam transfers to St. Agatha's Catholic School. There, he meets Maya Arnaz, a feisty, intelligent girl and class valedictorian. Adam gets Maya to tutor him and finds she helps him feel better, so he takes his new medication regularly. This reduces his visions, with only the side effect being muscle twitching. He takes a romantic interest in Maya and the two become close, but he does not disclose his condition to her out of fear ofstigmatization. Adam also starts to regularly confide in Father Patrick, the sympathetic school priest, about his fears and anxieties.
When Maya doesn't show to a tutoring session, Adam visits her home. He discovers that her family is struggling financially, and she is embarrassed and angry about his unannounced visit. Once Maya realizes he doesn't care about her background, she continues tutoring him. She invites him to her restaurant job where she has him cook for her, but a taste test leads Adam to the realization his medication is negatively affecting his taste buds.
Adam decides to stop taking his medications, unbeknownst to his mother Beth and stepfather Paul. His moods become imbalanced and his delusions return. The news that Beth is expecting a new baby with Paul also gives rise to Adam's insecurities about being unwanted and feeling like a burden. Nevertheless, Adam's grades improve so much that his essay is selected to be read at graduation. He asks Maya to the prom and she accepts.
Beth finds out Adam has stopped his medication and confronts him. Sister Catherine, the school's headmistress, is informed about the incident and about what happened at his last school. He is temporarily suspended, with the reasoning that it is for the students' safety. Adam lashes out at Paul, believing that an email Paul wrote to Sister Catherine the previous night is behind the suspension.
The suspension bars Adam from attending the prom, but he goes anyway. Before he leaves, he takes an overdose of his medication, believing it will help the night go smoothly. He meets Maya there, but as they dance, the dark voice plagues him and he begins to act erratically. Sister Catherine tries to kick him out, but his delusions cause him to push her to the ground, run to the catwalk, and fall over the edge.
Adam wakes in the hospital to see Beth and Paul. Maya shows up to visit, but he breaks down when the visions overwhelm him. He yells at her and tells her to leave. He is expelled from St. Agatha's and placed in a psych ward. Father Patrick visits and tells Adam he wasn't aware of his struggles, saying he will pray for him. Beth brings Adam a printed copy of the email Paul sent to St. Agatha's. Contrary to what Adam thought, Paul supported his stepson and wrote that suspending him would be cruel. Realizing how much he cares, Adam runs to catch up with him and Beth, hugging Paul for the first time and accepting him as a fatherly figure.
Beth and Paul take Adam to St. Agatha's graduation ceremony, where, despite Sister Catherine's attempt to stop him, he gathers the courage to address the student body calmly, with the support of Father Patrick. He quotes his essay in which he discusses both his condition and battle with schizophrenia, saying he wished he hadn't hidden his illness. After he leaves the auditorium, Maya runs after him. Adam apologizes for not telling her about his illness, at which point they express their mutual love and share a kiss.
Adam is able to receive his high school diploma and realizes his dream of attendingculinary school. As he celebrates the birth of his baby sister with his parents and Maya, it is shown that the voices are still present, but he has learned to live alongside them.
In February 2018,Thor Freudenthalwas announced as the film's director, from a screenplay by Nick Naveda, based on the novel of the same name by Julia Walton, withLD Entertainmentproducing.[6]Freudenthal read and enjoyed the novel, and felt that a film adaptation would allow the "opportunity for a very different kind of representation of mental illness with schizophrenia. We could create a person onscreen that was neither a mad genius nor a violent criminal, [but] who a lot of people could even see themselves in the way I did when I read the book. I loved that there was a sort of tender, compassionate, funny tone where Adam gets at some of the really tough issues with self-deprecating humor which really functions as a weapon of sorts against his pain."[7]
In March 2018,Charlie PlummerandTaylor Russellwere set to star in the film.[8]In April 2018,Andy García,Molly Parker,Walton Goggins,AnnaSophia Robb, andDevon Bostickalso joined the cast.[9][10]Andrew Hollander andThe Chainsmokerscomposed the film's score,[11]the first time the band has scored a film.[12]The trailer features The Chainsmokers' 2019 single "Push My Luck".[13]

In June 2020,Roadside Attractionsacquired distribution rights to the film and set it for an August 7, 2020, release.[16]The release date was later pushed forward a week, with the film newly scheduled for July 31, 2020. The film's official website later removed the release date, with "in theaters this summer" in its place.[17]The trailer premiered on July 15, 2020,[18]and the film was released to theaters on August 21, 2020.[4]
Opening as one of the first new films in wide release during theCOVID-19 pandemic, on August 21, 2020, the film made $462,050 from 925 theaters in its first weekend (an average of $499 per venue), finishing third at the box office. 54% of the audience was female, with 62% being between the ages 18–34.[19]The film expanded to 1,395 theaters in its second weekend, and grossed $453,000, then made $282,000 from 1,168 theaters in its third.[20][21]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 89 reviews, with an average of 7.2/10. The site's critics consensus reads, "Sensitive, well-acted, and solidly directed,Words on Bathroom Wallsis an admirable addition to a genre that too rarely does justice to its worthy themes."[22]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[23]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakreported 81% of filmgoers gave it a positive score.[19]
Words on Bathroom Wallsreceived praise for its performances, writing, and direction.[24][25]Guy Lodge ofVarietywrote, "There are pockets of truth, grace and pain in this portrait of troubled adolescence, and its talented young stars know where to find them".[24]Writing forAllMovie, Steven Yoder wrote, "Freudenthal understands the workings of the adolescent mind better than any director sinceJohn Hughes, and it shows through the ease of the actors' portrayals."[26]He added, "The script is tight, showing the progression of wellness, illness, hope, and setback without ever becoming preachy, instructional, or boring. It gives an accurate view of mental illness without being pushy about acceptance. Instead, it displays how not only someone with the illness must cope, but the varied ways that those around them react and cope as well. Nothing ever seems forced, and the action is fluid from the first moments to the closing credits."[26]
Judith Lawrence ofThe Michigan Dailycalled the film "refreshing in its empathetic representation of schizophrenia", writing: "Neither Adam nor schizophrenia is ever demonized, a rare find in the film industry.M. Night Shyamalan'sSplit, for example, was heavily criticized for its portrayal ofdissociative identity disorder. This is not a singular example — mental illnesses are often vilified and used as plot devices inhorror films. Part of the goal inWords on Bathroom Walls, though, is to show schizophrenia (and mental illness in general) as something that real people are constantly living with and battling."[27]
Nick Naveda received a nomination for the Best Adapted Screenplay Award from theChlotrudis Society for Independent Films.[28]
TheWords on Bathroom Wallssoundtrack album, including the soundtrack and score, was produced by Andrew Hollander featuringthe Chainsmokers, and released on August 21, 2020.[12]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
