The film starsMilla Jovovichin her sixth outing together with Anderson, her husband. The other cast members includeTony Jaa,Clifford "T.I." Harris Jr.,Meagan Good,Diego Boneta,Josh Helman,Jin Au-Yeung, andRon Perlman. The film follows Artemis (Jovovich) and her loyal soldiers when they are transported to a new world, where they engage in a battle for survival against enormous monsters with incredible powers.
A film adaptation based on the series had been in conception since 2012 by director Paul W. S. Anderson. The film was formally announced by Capcom in October 2018, with production starting that month withConstantin Film.Principal photographyon the film began on October 5, 2018 and was completed on December 19, 2018, inCape Town, South Africa.
Monster Hunterwas released to theaters during theCOVID-19 pandemic, bySony Pictures Releasing(excluding Germany, China and Japan), opening in China on December 4, 2020, and in the United States on December 18, 2020. The film was a box office disappointment, having only grossed$47.9 millionworldwide against a production budget of$60 millionand received mixed reviews, with praise for its action sequences, visual effects, and musical score, but criticism for its direction and editing.[7]It received a nomination at the19th Visual Effects Society Awards, in the categoryOutstanding Effects Simulations in a Photoreal Feature.
In the New World, humans co-exist with a wide variety of large and savage monsters. There a Hunter, a warrior trained to hunt and kill these powerful creatures, is separated from his team when their ship is attacked by the Diablos, a horned subterranean monster.
On Earth,U.S. Army RangerCaptainNatalie Artemis and herUnited Nations security teamsearch for a missing team of soldiers in the desert. A sudden storm pulls them into a portal to the New World where they find the remains of the missing soldiers and their vehicles.
As the Diablos approach them, the Hunter, who is observing the group, fires a warning signal. The Diablos, impervious to bullets and grenades, attacks and kills two members of the squad.
The survivors hide in a cave, where they are attacked by a pack of monster-sized spiders called Nerscyllas. Artemis is injected with a paralyzing venom, and as the others try to save her, more Nerscyllas arrive and swarm them. Artemis wakes up in a Nerscylla lair, finding her team dead orinfectedwith Nerscylla spawn, and escapes the lair by setting the pursuing monsters on fire.
Above ground, Artemis runs into the Hunter and, after fighting each other, they grudgingly agree to cooperate. She learns that the portals are created by the Sky Tower, a structure located across the desert. The Hunter reveals they will need to kill the Diablos in order to cross the desert safely and reach the tower.
Artemis learns how to fight using the Hunter's unique bladed weapons and helps him set a trap for the Diablos to kill it with Nerscylla venom. The attack is successful, with Artemis delivering the finishing blow, but the Hunter is badly wounded. Constructing a makeshift stretcher, she dutifully carries him across the desert.
The pair reaches an oasis populated withtortoise-like herbivores known as Apceros. When a Rathalos, a fire-breathingwyvern, flies by and causes the Apceros to stampede, Artemis and the Hunter are rescued by a group led by the Admiral. He explains that the Sky Tower was built by the first civilization to travel between worlds, using the monsters to protect it. Artemis agrees to help kill the Rathalos so she can return home.
In the ensuing battle, Artemis falls through the portal, returning to Earth. The portal does not close in time, and the Rathalos emerges and begins wreaking havoc. Artemis is able to slow it down long enough for the Hunter to slip through the portal and deliver the fatal shot.
The Admiral approaches Artemis, just before the appearance of another flying monster; a dragon known as Gore Magala. He notes that as long as the portal remains open, there will always be the threat that monsters will pass through to Earth. Artemis concludes that finding a way to take down the Sky Tower is now their primary objective.
In a mid-credits scene,Palico, the Admiral's cat-like companion, arrives to help fight the Gore Magala, while an ominous cloaked figure observes the battle from the top of the tower.
In 2012,Resident EvildirectorPaul W. S. Andersonwas then-rumored to be in talks to direct a film adaptation of theMonster Hunterfranchise.[11]Anderson stated he had discovered theMonster Hunterseries on travels to Japan around 2008 and had become a fan of the series, and considered a film adaptation as a "passion project".[12][13]Within a couple years from his introduction to the games, Anderson said he had started discussions with Capcom about securing the rights to make the film.[14]
During the September 2016Tokyo Game ShowCapcom producer Ryozo Tsujimoto stated that a live-actionMonster Hunterfilm was in development within Hollywood.[15]A few months later, Anderson and producerJeremy Bolt, both who helped to bring Capcom'sResident Evilgame to aseries of films, had obtained the rights from Capcom for theMonster Hunteradaption after about five years of discussion. The two anticipate a series ofMonster Hunterfilms. Anderson said he was drawn to theMonster Hunterproperty, not only because of the series' popularity, but also for the "incredibly beautiful, immersive world they've created". Anderson had already penned out a script, which would involve an American being dragged into the parallel universe in which theMonster Hunterseries is set, learning how to fight monsters, and then having to deal with the situation when monsters cross back into the real world and start attacking, such as a final climactic battle atLos Angeles International Airport.[16]At this stage of the script, the concept had been based on a young adult character from the real world called Lucas who was being sought as the hero to drive back the monsters from the real world to the fantasy one; in this form, the script would have explained why certain legends in the real world seemed to align with the monsters from the fantasy world. As the script developed over the intervening years, Anderson moved away from the "young adult" concept as the genre had become overused in Hollywood, and instead had developed a script based on the premises set byAvatarandRaiders of the Lost Ark.[17]Anderson said that the film's storyline was primarily based on a crossover event in the gameMetal Gear Solid: Peace WalkerwithMonster Hunter Freedom Unitein 2010, in which a military squad briefly faced monsters from theMonster Hunterseries, withMilla Jovovich's Artemis andTony Jaa's Hunter respectively replacing the video game roles of the charactersBig Boss (Snake)and Trenya, stating that "I thought this was great imagery to juxtapose a man with a machine gun[Snake]against the creatures [ofMonster Hunter].".[1]
The film was formally announced in May 2018.[18]According to Anderson, the success of the most recent game of the series at the time,Monster Hunter: World, which was developed by Capcom in early 2018 for a worldwide release rather than a limited Japanese one, led many film distributors to seek out potential for aMonster Hunterfilm only to discover he had already locked up the rights.[14]
Milla Jovovich, Anderson's spouse and past lead in hisResident Evilfilms, was affirmed in the starring role as Captain Artemis with the announcement of the film.[18]Anderson said that he wanted the lead character to be from outside theMonster Hunteruniverse as he wanted to introduce the world to the moviegoer in the same way he had experienced the games for the first time himself.[19]
Additional characters from theMonster Hunterrealm are based on those from the recentMonster Hunter: Worldgame.[19]On September 25, 2018, rapperT.I.andRon Perlmanwere cast in the film, in which T.I. would play Link, a sniper, while Perlman would play Admiral, the leader of the Hunter's Crew.[5]Tony Jaawas also cast in the film to play the male lead, The Hunter.[10]In October 2018,Diego Bonetajoined the film to play a character as a communications specialist.[20]Anderson stated that while there are some novel characters in the game, reflecting on the series' custom character creator, the film would still be characters essential to the series, including the Handler and the Admiral. He also stated that they will not need to create any new monsters, as the series has enough variety that they will be able to pull from for the film.[12]
Furthering on Anderson's appreciation of the game, he stated that all of the armor and weapons that the Hunters will wear will be based on the equipment from the game series, and will include at least one character that wears a mis-matched set of armor, which reflects on the player's ability within the game to mix and match armor sets for beneficial results. Anderson wanted to use various settings in the film to match the variety in a game, though recognized that one would not see as much variety in the film as one would see in playing aMonster Huntergame for several hours.[21]Jovovich, who stated she was also a fan of the video game series, was able to select what weapons she wanted her character to be shown with, and experimented in-game to narrow her choice to the dual blades, both as effective weapons in game and that "I thought they'd look really beautiful in an action sequence."[22]
The monsters in the film are further based on those in the game, including the series' signature monster the Rathalos; the game series' director Kaname Fujioka and producer Ryozo Tsujimoto provided input into the film's depiction of the monsters.[23]The movie will also feature palicos, a sentient cat-like species that assist the hunters in the game series, and will include the Meowscular Chef, a palico introduced inMonster Hunter: Worldthat once served as the Admiral's own aide before becoming a chef.[24]Capcom helped to establish the movie's setting, taking canonically after the events ofMonster Hunter: World, in a new area of theMonster Huntersetting but incorporating facets from several of the games in the series.[17]
Constantin Filmproduced the film, having planned to start production in late 2017 or early 2018,[25]but later confirmed during the 2018Cannes Film Festivalthat production would begin in September 2018 in and aroundCape TownandSouth Africa, with an estimatedUS$60 millionbudget. Some scenes were shot in Namibia, likeSpitzkoppeandSesriemcanyon.[18]Special effects studio Mr. X VFX, which worked on theResident Evilfilms, were also involved in the production.[18]
Principal photographybegan on October 5, 2018, inCape Town,South Africa.Milla Jovovichannounced on Instagram that principal photography was completed on December 19, 2018.[26]
A teaser for the film was first shown at theShanghai International Film Festivalin June 2019, along with the announcement thatTohoandTencentwill oversee the film's distribution in Japan and China, respectively.[27]The studio spent just $1.3 million on television ads in the week leading up to the film's U.S. release (compared to the $17 million Warner Bros. spent promotingWonder Woman 1984), withDeadline Hollywoodstating "likely Sony is holding back some of the minimal marketing dollars to spend this coming week".[28]
Monster Hunterwas released in the United States on December 18, 2020.[29]The film was originally scheduled to be released on September 4, 2020,[30]but was delayed to April 23, 2021,[31]due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, before being moved up to December 30, then finally the Christmas date.[32]Sony yet again altered the film's release date in the United States in early December after the film's troublesome release in China, moving its release to December 18, 2020.[33]The film was theatrically released in Japan byToho-Towaon March 26, 2021.[34]
The film was released bySony Pictures Home Entertainmenton digital on February 16, 2021, with the Blu-ray,4K Blu-ray, and DVD released on March 2, 2021.[35]
As of September 24, 2024[update],Monster Hunterhas grossed $15.2 million in the United States and Canada,[36]and $32.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $47.9 million.[6]
The film released alongsideFatale, and was projected to gross around $3 million in its opening weekend.[37]It grossed $800,000 on its first day of release in the United States and Canada, opening in second behind holdoverThe Croods: A New Age.[38]It went on to debut to $2.2 million from 1,738 theaters, lower than expected but still topping the box office and dethroningA New Age.[28]Following the weekend,Varietywrote that the film "looks to lose money in its theatrical run."[39]In the film's second weekend it fell 48.9%, grossing $1.1 million, then made $1.3 million in its third weekend, finishing fourth both times.[40][41]
The film debuted to $2.7 million from five countries in its opening weekend. It made $5.3 million from China before being pulled from theaters, although the total was not added to the global total.[42]It made $1.3 million over its second weekend, remaining in first place in Taiwan ($610,000) and Saudi Arabia ($310,000).[43]
The Indian Expressdescribed the critical response as "mixed",[44]whileGame Rantcalled it "negative".[45]Screen Rantreported a "mixed to negative" response, with praise for its action sequences and visual effects but criticism of film's "oversaturated genre trappings" as well as its direction and editing.[7]
On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, 44% of critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Monster Hunteris mostly a mindless blur of action, held together by the slenderest threads of dialogue and plot – and exactly what many viewers will be looking for."[46]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[47]Audiences polled byPostTrak, gave the film 63%, with 41% saying they would definitely recommend it.[28]
Peter Debruge ofVarietywrote, "There will be critics who can tell you who these characters are, or what's up with the 'new world' where monsters live, or why those of us in the 'old world' should be worried about them, but that information is not presented in this visually interesting but narratively anemic motion picture (nor the press notes, for that matter), so please accept my apologies in advance: This review will likely be about as coherent as the film itself."[2]David Ehrlich ofIndieWire, gave the film a grade of D− and said, "Series fans will feel cheated by such a chintzy and incurious take on something they love, while the rest of us will be left wondering how the source material earned itself any fans in the first place."[48]
Just after the Chinese release on December 4, 2020, the film caused an uproar on Chinese social media because of a scene in which Jin's character jokingly asks: "Look at my knees!", and to the question "What kind of knees are these?", he replies: "Chi-knees!". Chinese viewers interpreted this as a reference to the racist playground chant "Chinese, Japanese, dirty knees", and therefore as an insult to Chinese people.[49]The film was removed from circulation, and Chinese authorities censored references to it online. Tencent had reportedly prepared modified versions of the films omitting the line but even these showings were pulled.[50]The reaction to the film also caused Chinese users toreview bombMonster Hunter: Worldin reference to the lines.[51]
Constantin Film apologized for the dialogue and stated they will remove the dialogue from the film before it is re-released.[52]Jin said that for his character, the line was "to proudly proclaim he is a Chinese soldier, not just his knees, but his arms, his head, his heart".[49]Anderson stated that "It was never our intention to send a message of discrimination or disrespect to anyone. To the contrary – at its heart our movie is about unity", and that the line had been removed from all international versions of the film prior to their releases.[49]
It received a nomination at the19th Visual Effects Society Awards, in the categoryOutstanding Effects Simulations in a Photoreal Feature.[53]
In November 2020,Paul W. S. Andersontalked about a possible sequel saying "There are hundreds of monsters [in the game]. I can only use five or six of them in the movie. So it's a big, fun world that I think we've only just started to scratch the surface of."Milla Jovovichadded to the discussion saying "Definitely, we would love to make another one. Hopefully, people are going to love it because I know Paul [W. S. Anderson] would love to make a sequel. I mean, he's already writing something."[54]

Screen Gemsis an American film production company owned bySony Pictures Entertainment, a subsidiary of Japanese multinational conglomerate,Sony Group Corporation.[1]TheScreen Gemsbrand has served several different purposes for its parent companies over the decades since its incorporation, initially as a cartoon studio, then a television studio, and later on as a film studio. The label currently serves as a film production that specializes in genre films, mainly horror.[2]
Screen Gems is a member of theMotion Picture Association(MPA).[3]
When producerPat Sullivancame toHarry Warnerto sign a contract with him on his andOtto Messmer's seriesFelix the Cat, he declined and instead told his soon-to-be former secretaryMargaret J. Winklerthat she should form her own company and take control of the distribution of the series. Winkler formed M.J. Winkler Productions and soon also took control ofMaxandDave Fleischer's seriesOut of the Inkwell. By 1923 she and Sullivan were arguing, and that same year the Fleischer Brothers formed their own distribution company named Red Seal. Winkler saw an unreleased short calledAlice's Wonderland, a cartoon produced and directed byWalt Disney, and became impressed with the short. The two agreed to make a series about the cartoon. In 1924,Charles Mintzmarried Winkler, and the latter's career began to decline. Mintz quickly assumed Winkler's role in the company, later rebranding it Winkler Pictures.
In 1925 Winkler's renewal contract for the Felix shorts was written, yet Winkler declined to renew due to her dispute with Sullivan. The following year theAlice Comediesstopped being distributed by Winkler. After Mintz become involved with the progress it was clear that Disney was unhappy with the production costs on cartoons, and he asked Disney andUb Iwerksto develop a new character. The result wasOswald the Lucky Rabbit, the first animated character forUniversal Pictures.[4]In February 1928, when the character proved more successful than expected, Disney sought to meet with Mintz over the budget, wanting to spend more on the cartoons. Mintz refused, and hired away all ofWalt Disney Studios's animators except Iwerks, Les Clark, and Johnny Cannon, who all refused to leave Disney. He moved the production of the Oswald cartoons to Winkler Pictures, along with Margaret Winkler's brother, George. After losing the Oswald contract toWalter Lantz, Mintz focused onKrazy Kat(a character from a comic strip by cartoonistGeorge Herriman), which was the output of a Winkler-distributed property.
M.J. Winkler Productions became known as Winkler Pictures after Mintz took over in 1926 and partnered withColumbia Picturesfor distribution in 1929. In 1931, when the studio moved from New York to California, it was renamed The Charles Mintz Studio.[5]
The Charles Mintz studio became known as Screen Gems in 1933. The name was originally used in 1933, whenColumbia Picturesacquired a stake in Charles Mintz's animation studio.[6]The name was derived from an early Columbia Pictures slogan, "Gems of the Screen"; itself a takeoff on the song "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean".[7]Mintz was nominated for twoAcademy Awardsfor Best Short Subject. His first nomination was in 1935 forHoliday Land, and he was nominated again in 1937 forThe Little Match Girl. For about a decade,Charles MintzproducedKrazy Kat,Scrappy, and theColor Rhapsodyanimated short series Columbia Pictures. Also, between 1937 to 1940, several Color Rhapsody films were subcontracted toUb Iwerkswith the use of his ownanimation studio.
The studio's color cartoons were well received, while some other cartoons were not, mainly the laterKrazy KatandScrappyshorts. Animator Isidore Klein was particularly frustrated with theKrazy Katcartoons as it bear little resemblance to Herriman's comic strip by the mid 1930s (despite attempting to make a more faithful cartoon with the 1936 shortLil' Ainjil, which Klein was disappointed by the final product).[8]Furthermore, Columbia gave Mintz strict financial obligations where they advance a certain amount of money, resulting Mintz repeatedly running intocost overruns.[9]In 1939, after becoming indebted to Columbia and suffering from declining health, Mintz relinquished ownership of his studio and the Screen Gems name to Columbia to settle longstanding financial problems.[10]He would later pass away on December 30, 1939, from a heart attack.Krazy Katwas discontinued the following year, while the Scrappy cartoons ended a year afterwards.
By 1940, Columbia would oversee management of the studio following ownership. The studio's production manager, Jimmy Bronis, became the studio head but was shortly replaced by Mintz's brother-in-law, George Winkler. The following year, Columbia decided to hireFrank Tashlin, previously a writer forWalt Disney Productionsand director forLeon Schlesinger Productions, as the studio head instead.[11]Tashlin had a profound effect to the studio as he planned to revitalize it to greater heights. There, he would hire many displaced animators from the 1941Disney animators' strike, as well as making the decision of firing the bulk of their initial in-house staff (includingArthur Davis,Manny Gould,Lou Lilly, Ben Harrison and Winkler). He would also direct the shortThe Fox and the Grapes. Based on theAesop fable of the same name, the short would inadvertently spawn Columbia's most successful characters withThe Fox and the Crow, a comic duo of a refined Fox and a street-wise Crow. Tashlin was later replaced by Ben Schwalb as producer in April 1942, but continued to work there as a creative supervisor.[12]
Tashlin proved to be very influential to his staff, as he allowed and encouraged them to pursue the wildest of ideas under his supervision. However, his stay at Screen Gems would be short-lived, as he would later leave the studio in June following an argument with Columbia higher-ups.[12][13]When interviewed by Michael Barrier, he said that the management "can't stay happy long when things are going well, so we ended up in another fracas and I left."[11]He was replaced byDave Fleischer(who produced the 1942 WWII shortSong of Victoryunder Tashlin's supervision), previously the co-founder and head supervisor ofFleischer Studios.John Hubleydescribed Fleischer as being very detached from his employees, calling him "one of the world's intellectual lightweights". He was also known for editing completed cartoons in a way that broke continuity.[14]He was later fired and succeeded by a revolving door of producers, including musician Paul Worth,Three StoogesproducerHugh McCollumand ex-Schlesinger assistants Ray Katz and Henry Binder. The studio would also create several more recurring characters around this time, includingTito and His Burrito,Flippy,Flop the Cat, Igor Puzzlewitz,Willoughby Wren,and an adaptation ofAl Capp'scomic seriesLi'l Abner, with varying levels of success.
Tashlin's departure had an immediate effect to the studio in a direction standpoint, with animation historians noting that the quality of there cartoons had declined soon after. Film historianLeonard Maltinclaimed that after Tashlin left, the studio "tried to maintain some spirit on-screen, with varying results. Screen Gems cartoons of the 1940s feature some of the least endearing cartoon characters ever created, and suffer from misguided story direction," which was seen in shorts such asMass Mouse Meeting(1943) andGiddy-Yapping(1944).[15]Hubley, who went on to directProfessor Tall and Mr. Small,He Can't Make It StickandThe Rocky Road to Ruin(all 1943) with Paul Sommer, said to have disliked his work at the studio, and that Columbia "hated" the cartoons they were making.[14]Capp was also reportedly displeased with the quality of theLi'l Abnercartoons, which was discontinued after five cartoons,[16]and the shorts produced by Katz and Binder were criticized for being "pale carbons of the Warner Brothers shorts,"[17]to the point of creating clone characters ofSylvester the Cat, andDaffy Duck, respectively.[18]
In addition to Tashlin's departure, many of the ex-Disney animators that he hired also left for other studios; the inability to hire and maintain more experienced directors and storymen, as well as Columbia's mismanagement were also argued as other key factors to the studios diminished quality. Some staff members during this period included Bob Wickersham, Alec Geiss, Sid Marcus (one of the few pre-Tashlin artists who stayed in the studio), Howard Swift andAlex Lovy.Bob Clampettwas also brought in as a gag writer before setting up his own brief animation studio forRepublic Pictures, whileLooney TunewritersMichael MalteseandTedd Piercewere said to have moonlighted for a few cartoons.[19][20]
Screen Gems was, in an attempt to keep costs low, the last American animation studio to stop producing black and white cartoons. The final black-and-white Screen Gems shorts appeared in 1946, over three years after the second-longest holdouts (Famous Studiosand Leon Schlesinger Productions). During that same year, Columbia, still dissatisfied of the studios output, decided to shut its doors for good, but continured to release a back catalog of shorts up until 1949.[21]The studio name was later repurposed for a television division, while the former Seward Street facility, which Screen Gems occupied since 1940, was taken over byWalter Lantz Productionsin 1947.[22]
The Screen Gems cartoons were regarded as ones of varying quality, comparable to those produced byFamous StudiosandTerrytoons. In spite of the studio's internal affairs, the Screen Gems' cartoons were still moderately successful, with three more cartoons achievingAcademy Awards nominations. The cartoons produced and supervised by Tashlin were also praised for his attempts at revitalizing the studio. However, Screen Gems never achieved a level of success comparable toWalt Disney Productions,Warner Bros. Cartoons,Walter Lantz Productionsand theMGM Cartoon Studio. The studio's purpose was assumed by an outside producer,United Productions of America(UPA), whose cartoons, includingGerald McBoing-Boingand theMr. Magooseries, were major critical and commercial successes. Following UPA, a deal withHanna-Barberawas made in 1957, which lasted until 1967.
In 1999,Columbia TriStar International TelevisionproducedTotally Tooned In- a syndicated TV package showcasing Columbia's classic cartoon library. With the aid of animation historianJerry Beck, Columbia restored and remastered the majority of the color Screen Gems cartoons (as well as all the UPA cartoons) from their original 35mm elements. The show aired in several international markets before making its American television debut onAntenna TVon January 8, 2011. They would later be aired onToon In With Meon theMeTVNetwork in November 2021.[23]Despite these restoration efforts,Sony Pictures Home Entertainmenthas no current plans to release these shorts on DVD or Blu-ray. Since CPE Holdings, Inc. became dormant on May 9, 2024,Sony Pictures Releasingnow owns the theatrical distribution on behalf ofColumbia Pictures, whileSony Pictures Televisionowns the television distribution on behalf of CPT Holdings, Inc. to the majority of the color Screen Gems cartoons (as well as all the UPA cartoons) library.
All series were distributed by Columbia unless otherwise noted.[24]
Ralph Cohn, the son of Columbia co-founderJack Cohnand nephew of Columbia headHarry Cohn, founded Pioneer Telefilms, a television commercial production company, in 1947. Ralph later wrote a 50-page memo arguing that Columbia should be the first major film studio to move into television. Although Harry wasn't convinced by the suggestion, Columbia invested $50,000 acquiring Pioneer and reorganized it as Screen Gems.[26]The studio started its new business in New York on April 15, 1949.[27]
By 1951, Screen Gems became a full-fledged television studio by producing and syndicating several popular shows(seebelow). Within a few months, Ralph Cohn had sold a half-hour dramatic anthology concept to theFord Motor Companywhich becameFord Theatre, which was one of the first times a major Hollywood movie studio had produced content for television. They also produced seven episodes of the first season ofCavalcade of America.[28][29]
The name "Screen Gems," at the time, was used to hide the fact that the film studio was entering television production and distribution. Many film studios saw television as a threat to their business, thus it was expected that they would shun the medium. However, Columbia was one of a few studios who branched out to television under a pseudonym to conceal the true ownership of the television arm. That is until 1955, when Columbia decided to usethe woman from its logounder the Screen Gems banner, officially billing itself as a part of "the Hollywood studios of Columbia Pictures", as spoken in announcements at the end of some Screen Gems series.
By 1952, the studio had produced a series of about 100 film-record coordinated releases for television under the brand "TV Disk Jockey Toons" in which the films "synchronize perfectly with the records".[30]
In 1954, the studio started producingFather Knows Beston CBS andThe Adventures of Rin Tin Tinon ABC, which became their biggest successes at the time.[26]
On July 1, 1956, studio veteranIrving Briskinstepped down as stage manager of Columbia Pictures and formed his own production company Briskin Productions, Inc. to release series through Screen Gems and supervise all of its productions.[31]On December 10, 1956, Screen Gems expanded into television syndication by acquiring Hygo Television Films (a.k.a. Serials Inc.) and its affiliated company United Television Films, Inc. Hygo Television Films was founded in 1951 by Jerome Hyams, who also acquired United Television Films in 1955 that was founded by Archie Mayers.[32]
During that year, the studio began syndicating Columbia Pictures' theatrical film library to television, including the series of two-reel short subjects starringThe Three Stoogesin 1957. Earlier on August 2, 1957, they also acquired syndication rights to "Shock Theater", a package ofUniversal Pictureshorror films (later shifted toMCA TV), which was enormously successful in reviving that genre.[33]
From 1958 to 1974, under President John H. Mitchell and Vice President of ProductionHarry Ackerman, Screen Gems delivered TV shows and sitcoms:Dennis the Menace,The Donna Reed Show,Hazel,Here Come the Brides,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,Gidget,Bewitched,I Dream of Jeannie,The Flying Nun,The Monkees,The Girl with Something ExtraandThe Partridge Family.
It was also the first distributor forHanna-Barbera Productions, an animation studio founded byWilliam HannaandJoseph Barberaafter leavingMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and was also the distributor of theSoupy Salesshow. The company also entered a co-production deal withCanada'sCTV Television Networkand produced several shows, many of which were filmed or taped inTorontofor distribution to Canadian stations (Showdown,The Pierre Berton Show).[citation needed]The company even expanded as far asAustralia, opening Screen Gems Australia to produce shows for that country's networks, includingThe Graham Kennedy Showfor theNine Network.[34]
In the late 1950s, Screen Gems also entered into ownership and operation of television stations. Stations owned by Screen Gems over the years included KCPX (Salt Lake City; nowKTVX, owned byNexstar Media Group),WVUE-DT(New Orleans; now owned byGray Television),WAPA-TV(San Juan; now owned by the Hemisphere Media Group),WNJU(Linden, NJ; nowTelemundo/NBCUniversalO&O), and several radio stations as well, including 50,000-watt clear channelWWVA(Wheeling, WV; now owned byiHeartMedia). As a result, in funding its acquisitions, 18% of Screen Gems' shares was spun off from Columbia and it became a publicly-traded company on the NYSE until 1968. Screen Gems also provided technical assistance and partial control of a private television station inVenezuela,Canal 11 Televisión, which existed from 1966 to 1968.[35][36]
In 1963, William Dozier, who was one of the top Screen Gems employees, and senior vice president of production left to start out Greenway Productions, with a non-exclusive agreement with the studio for joint distribution of its TV productions.[37]Even though none of Greenway's shows went to SG, Greenway immediately struck out a deal with rival television producer20th Century-Fox Televisionin 1964.[38]
In 1963, Screen Gens entered music publishing with the purchase ofDon Kirshner'sAldon Musicwith Kirshner named head of the Columbia-Screen Gems music division.  Four years later, he departed Screen Gems after coming into conflict withThe Monkeesover their desire to play on their records.Lester Sillreplaced Kirshner, and remained head of music publishing until 1985.  Screen Gems-Columbia Music was sold to EMI for $23.5 million in 1976.
From 1964 to 1969, former child starJackie Cooperwas Vice President of Program Development. He was responsible for packaging series (such asBewitched) and other projects and selling them to the networks.
For the 1965–1966 season, Screen Gems announced that they would sign three big creative programmers to develop new series, which was announced in June 1964. Among them was writerSidney Sheldon, directorHy Averback, and writerDavid Swift.[39]
In 1965, Columbia Pictures acquired a fifty per cent interest in the New York-based commercialproduction companyEUE, which was incorporated into Screen Gems and renamedEUE/Screen Gems. The studios were sold in 1982 to longtime Columbia Pictures executive George Cooney shortly after Columbia Pictures was sold toThe Coca-Cola Company.
On December 23, 1968, Screen Gems merged with its parent company Columbia Pictures Corporation and became part of the newly formed Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. for $24.5 million.[40]
In the following year, formerABCvice president of programmingLeonard Goldbergjoined Screen Gems, displacing Jackie Cooper as vice president of program development.[41]Goldberg failed to receive the same level of success as Cooper. His shows all tanked after one season, with the exception ofThe Partridge Family, and he abruptly left after three years, with the most notable other production of Goldberg's tenure at Screen Gems being the 1971 television movieBrian's Song. He then formed a production company with producerAaron Spelling.[42]
In 1971,Douglas S. Cramer, former executive VP in charge of production atParamount Television, set up a SG-affiliated production firm, The Douglas S. Cramer Company, to produce projects for feature films and TV projects via Columbia Pictures.[43]In 1972,David Gerber, who had left20th Century Fox Television, set up a SG-affiliated production company to produce his own projects with that company. The most notable of these productions wasPolice Story, an NBC police crime drama.[42]In 1973, Allan Blye andChris Beardevia Blye-Bearde Productions signed an independent production agreement with Screen Gems to develop their own projects.[44]Also that year, Harry Ackerman, who was vice president of production left the studio to start his own production company to be affiliated withParamount Television.[45]

Columbia was, technically, the last major studio to enter television by name.
Changes in corporate ownership of Columbia came in 1982, when Coca-Cola bought the company, although continuing to trade under the CPT name.  In the mid-1980s, Coca-Cola reorganized its television holdings to create Coca-Cola Television, merging CPT with the television unit of Embassy Communications as Columbia/Embassy Television, although both companies continued to use separate identities until January 2, 1988, when it andTri-Star Televisionwere merged under the CPT name.[47]Columbia also ranColex Enterprises, a joint venture withLBS Communicationsto distribute most of the Screen Gems library, which ended in 1987.[48]In 1985, the name was brought back byColumbia Pictures Televisionto distribute classic television series from its vaults to first-run syndication.[49]
On December 18, 1987, Coca-Cola spun off its entertainment holdings and sold it toTri-Star Pictures, Inc.for $3.1 billion. It was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc., also creating Columbia/Tri-Star by merging Columbia and Tri-Star. Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names.[50]In 1989,SonyCorporation of Japan purchased Columbia Pictures Entertainment. On August 11, 1991, Columbia Pictures Entertainment was renamed asSony Pictures Entertainmentas a film production-distribution subsidiary and subsequently combined CPT with a revived TriStar Television on February 21, 1994 to formColumbia TriStar Television. The name "Screen Gems" was also utilized for a syndicated hour-long program for classic television calledScreen Gems Networkthat first aired in 1999 and ran until 2002.[51]
The television division is presently known asSony Pictures Television.

Constantin FilmverleihGmbHwas founded in West Germany on 1 April 1950 byPreben PhilipsenandWaldfried Barthel[de], who would later become the head of publicity for the company. It was originally the country's national distributor of films produced byColumbia PicturesandUnited Artists. Throughout the 1950s, Constantin distributed both popular and art-house films from several nations as well as medium-budgeted domestic films.
Constantin's popularity grew through the late 1950s to the 1960s by not only distributing popular films but creating its own in-house talent roster of contract players (Joachim Fuchsberger,Heinz Drache), directors and producers (Wolf C. Hartwig), as well as co-financinginternational co-productionfilms shot in Italy, such as theClint Eastwood spaghetti westerns, the films ofHarry Alan Towersand others using their own stable of stars. Constantin also had great success with theirJerry Cottonfilm series,[15]: 82–87though projected film series ofSherlock Holmes,Jules MaigretandPerry Rhodanonly had one entry.
Constantin Filmverleih was renamed toConstantin Film GmbHon 21 September 1964, and on 1 July 1965,Bertelsmann Publishingbecame the majority shareholder of Constantin. They attempted to increase output without increasing investment that resulted in the demise of many of the studio's popular film series, investment in sex films, and a stronger emphasis on releasing films from other nations rather than shooting their own. Bertelsmann sold its shares in 1969.[15]: 86–87The "old" Constantin Film GmbH was eventually declared bankrupt in October 1977.[16]
Founded in 1979 byBernd Eichinger, with Bernd Schaefers,[17]asNeue Constantin Filmafter acquiring the assets of the bankrupt "old" Constantin Film GmbH the previous year, Constantin Film developed into the first German film distributor with its own production company in just six years, with production activities extending to the international market. In 1986, theKirch Group(at the time Europe's biggest film and TV license traders) acquired a minority stake in Neue Constantin Film.  Eichinger retained one of the company's leading executives and a major shareholder to his death in 2011.[18]
In the following years, Constantin Film fixed its position on the international movie market by establishing various production subsidiaries across Europe in 1996. At the end of the 1990s, Constantin Film acquired majority stakes in the film production companies Olga Film GmbH, Engram Pictures and MOOVIE GmbH. In September 1999, the company then went public on the German stock market asConstantin Film AG. Deutsche Börse placed the Constantin Film share on the selection index Nemax 50 in March 2000. In 2000, the company partnered with American producerPropaganda Filmsto start ProCon Films, the venture was quickly dissolved in October 2001.[19][20]
Constantin Film AG foundedRat Pack FilmproduktionGmbH with producer Christian Becker and his team in 2001. The Swiss Highlight Communications AG (a strategy and finance holding with the operative segments of film and sports and event marketing) acquired 23 percent of the capital stock of Constantin Film AG from Kirch Beteiligungs GmbH und Co. KG and from diversified holdings for the first time in 2002. In 2003, the board of Constantin Film AG embarked on a new strategic path for the company: the traditional business areas of production and distribution were expanded to include the three areas of license trading, home entertainment exploitation and increased TV service production (especially TV entertainment). Constantin Film AG also acquired 61 percent of the shares in KirchMedia Entertainment GmbH (now renamed Constantin Entertainment GmbH), one of the market leaders in German show and entertainment production. The stake was increased to 100 percent in 2005.
At the end of 2009, the listing of Constantin Film AG expired; all the shares were transferred to Highlight Communications after a squeeze-out. As of 7 October 2009, Constantin Film is no longer listed at theFrankfurter Börse.

Toho Co., Ltd.[b](東宝株式会社,Tōhō Kabushiki-gaisha)is a Japanese entertainment company that primarily engages in producing and distributing films and exhibiting stage plays. It is headquartered inChiyoda, Tokyo, and is one of the core companies of theOsaka-basedHankyu Hanshin Toho Group. Toho is best known for producing and distributing many ofIshirō HondaandEiji Tsuburaya'skaijuandtokusatsufilms as well as the films ofAkira Kurosawaand theanimeofStudio Ghibli,CoMix Wave Films,TMS Entertainment, andOLM, Inc.The company has released the majority of thehighest-grossing Japanese films, and through its subsidiaries, is the largest film importer in Japan.
Toho's most famous creation isGodzilla, featured in 33 of the company's films. Godzilla,Rodan,Mothra,King Ghidorah, andMechagodzillaare described as Toho's Big Five due to their numerous appearances throughout theGodzillafranchise, as well as spin-offs. Toho has also been involved in the production of numerous anime titles. Its subdivisions are Toho-Towa Company, Limited (Japanese exclusive theatrical distributor ofUniversal PicturesviaNBCUniversal Entertainment Japan), Towa Pictures Company Limited (Japanese exclusive theatrical distributor ofParamount Pictures), Toho Pictures Incorporated,Toho International Inc., Toho E. B. Company Limited, and Toho Music Corporation & Toho Costume Company Limited. The company is the largest shareholder (7.96%) ofFuji Media Holdings Inc.
Toho is one of the four members of the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan (MPPAJ), is the largest of Japan's Big Four film studios, and is the only film studio that is a component of theNikkei 225index.
Toho was created by the founder of theHankyu Railway,Ichizō Kobayashi, in 1932 as theTokyo-Takarazuka Theatre Company(株式会社東京宝塚劇場,Kabushiki gaisha Tōkyō Takarazuka Gekijō). It managed much of thekabukiin Tokyo and, among other properties, the eponymousTokyo Takarazuka Theatreand theImperial Garden TheaterinTokyo; Toho andShochikuenjoyed a duopoly over theaters in Tokyo for many years.[3]
After the end ofWorld War II, the newOccupationgovernment allowed and encouraged the formation oflabor unions, which had been banned under the Imperial government.[4]During ageneral strikeof film studio employees beginning in October 1946, a group of Toho's ten top stars led byDenjiro Okochisplit from the main Toho union along with 445 employees. During the resolution of the strike, aclosed-shopprovision with the main union led to the establishment of theShintohoCompany, which comprised the members of the dissenting union and former Toho facilities.[5]
The loss of major stars led to the hiring and training of new stars, includingToshiro Mifune.[5]The contract made after the strike stipulated that Toho would only produce films approved by a committee that included union members, which led to filmmakers gaining unprecedented creative and productive control over their films.[5]While Toho produced only thirteen films in 1947, six Toho films, includingOne Wonderful Sunday, directed byAkira Kurosawa, were ranked among the best ten films of the year inKinema Junpo.[5]However, each film had double or triple the budget of films produced by other studios, and the company suffered severe losses.[6]
In 1948, the new Toho president Tetsuzo Watanabe ordered a return of the wartime quota of 24 films per year and the end of control over production by the union.  In April, Toho management announced the dismissal of 1200 employees,[7]with the aim of both cutting expenses and eliminating Communist leaders from the union.[8]Negotiations failed and the union occupied the studio on April 15, joined by activists from theJapan Communist Partyand other organizations, erectingbarricadesand closing the main gates.[7]
On August 13, theTokyo District Courtdecided in Toho's favor,[7]and on the morning of August 19, a district police chief arrived at the front gate to read out the court decision. Two thousand policemen surrounded the studio, reinforced by soldiers, three airplanes, and severalarmored carsand tanks sent by theU.S. Eighth Army.[7][9]The union leaders agreed to end their occupation on the condition the union was not disbanded.[7]
Toho was severely weakened after the strikes and produced only four films in 1948 and five films in 1949, and continued to distribute Shintoho films until the end of 1949.[10]
In May 1953, Toho establishedToho International, aLos Angeles-based subsidiary intended to targetNorth AmericanandLatin Americanmarkets.Seven Samuraiwas among the first films offered for foreign sales.[11]
Toho and Shochiku competed with the influx of Hollywood films and boosted the film industry by focusing on new directors of the likes ofAkira Kurosawa,Kon Ichikawa,Keisuke Kinoshita,Ishirō Honda, andKaneto Shindo.[12]
After several successful film exports to the United States during the 1950s throughHenry G. Saperstein, Toho took over theLa Brea TheatreinLos Angelesto show its films without the need to sell them to a distributor. It was known as the Toho Theatre from the late 1960s until the 1970s.[13]Toho also had a theater inSan Franciscoand opened a theater inNew York Cityin 1963.[14]TheShintohoCompany, which existed until 1961, was named New Toho because it broke off from the original company.[15]Toho has contributed to the production of some American films, includingSam Raimi's 1998 film,A Simple Plan[16]andPaul W. S. Anderson's 2020military science fiction/kaijufilm,Monster Hunter.[17]
In 2019, Toho invested ¥15.4 billion ($14 million) into their Los Angeles-based subsidiaryToho International Inc.as part of their "Toho Vision 2021 Medium-term Management Strategy", a strategy to increase content, platform, real-estate, beat JPY50 billion profits, and increase character businesses on Toho intellectual properties such as Godzilla. Hiroyasu Matsuoka was named the representative director of the US subsidiary.[18]
In 2020, Toho acquired a 34.8% stake in the animation studio TIA, with ILCA and Anima each retaining a 32.6% stake. In 2022, Toho acquired Anima's 32.6% stake to take a controlling 67.4% stake in TIA, making the studio a subsidiary, and ultimately renaming the studio into Toho Animation Studios.[19]
In December 2023, Toho announced their intent to acquire a 25% stake in Fifth Season for $225 million via Toho International. Following the completion of the deal, Fifth Season will be valued at $900 million;CJ ENMwill remain the majority shareholder in the company, with former ownerEndeavoralso continuing to serve as a strategic shareholder. CEOs Graham Taylor and Chris Rice stated that this investment would empower the company to continue the expansion of its premium slate and create opportunities for collaboration between Fifth Season, Toho and CJ ENM to produce global content as well as content produced in Japan.[20]
Following the success ofGodzilla Minus One(2023) as their first self-distributed film in the U.S., Toho declared in March 2024 that Godzilla is their "Intellectual property(IP) treasure" and they had regained retailing rights overseas (which were once abandoned), and now are able to sell, advertise, and distribute their own products to consumers outside Japan directly.[21]The company also said that the film winningBest Visual Effectsat the96th Academy Awardsis helping them gain more recognition and advancing more business extension overseas.[22]

Linked page for 'Paul W. S. Anderson' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_W._S._Anderson):
Paul William Scott Anderson(born 4 March 1965) is an English film director, screenwriter, and producer who often makesscience fiction filmsandvideo game adaptations.
Anderson made his feature film debut with the British independent filmShopping(1994); he found commercial success with his second film,Mortal Kombat(1995), made in the US, based on the first couple ofvideo games of the same namebyMidway Games. He is best known as the creative voice behind the first six live-action films of theResident Evilfilm series(2002–2016), which starsMilla Jovovich(whom he married in 2009), and is based on theCapcomvideo game seriesof the same name. The series' first six live-action films, of which Anderson directed four, have collectively grossed over $1 billion worldwide. Other notable films of Anderson's areEvent Horizon(1997), an initial critical and commercial disappointment that found renewed appreciation on home media;Alien vs. Predator(2004), based on thecrossoverconceptof the same namebetween theAlienandPredatorfranchises;Death Race(2008), a remake/prequel to 1975'sDeath Race 2000, and the epic romantic historical disasterPompeii(2014).
Anderson and producerJeremy BoltfoundedImpact Picturesin 1992, under which most of Anderson's films have been made.[2]
Anderson was born inWallsend,North TynesideinEngland. At the age of nine, he began making films with aSuper 8 film camera.[3]After attendingRoyal Grammar SchoolinNewcastle upon Tyne, Englandhe became the youngest person ever to graduate from theUniversity of Warwickwith aB.A.degree in film and literature.[4]
Anderson began his professional career as a writer on the Britishcrimedrama filmcomedyseriesEl C.I.D., which ran for three series, from 1990 to 1992, and starredAlfred Molinain its first two. He met producer Jeremy Bolt and they founded Impact Pictures in 1992, looking to raise money for Anderson's feature film debut as a director, from anactioncrime drama script of his own calledShopping. After much trouble securing funding,[3]Shopping, which starsSean Pertwee,Jude Law(in his first feature film role) andSadie Frost, was released in the United Kingdom in 1994.[2]The censors of theBritish Board of Film Classificationwere not happy with the film's violence and delayed its release for months. When it was eventually released, critics panned it, and some cinemas decided to ban it for promoting an "irresponsible" outlook. In the United States, it received only an edited, direct-to-video release two years later.[5][6]Anderson creditsShoppingfor inspiringChannel Four Films, who had financed it, to also finance the more successfulShallow GraveandTrainspottingfilms byDanny Boyle, which in turn, he believes, made critics reassess his film in a more positive light in later years, as one of the first in a new wave of British films concerning its youth.[7]Shoppingis Anderson's one and only British film,[2]as he grew up watching American and mainland European movies, never imagining himself a British filmmaker. WhenShoppingwas accepted in theSundance Film Festival, American studios noticed its impressive look and style despite its relatively small $2 million budget, which led to opportunities inHollywoodfor Anderson.[8]
Anderson directed thefantasymartial artsvideo game adaptationMortal Kombatin 1995. Using a script written by Kevin Droney, the film was based on the first entry in the video game franchise byMidway Games,Mortal Kombat, although elements and characters were borrowed from the original game's sequel,Mortal Kombat II. The film featured anensemble cast, includingRobin ShouasLiu KangandChristopher LambertasRaiden. Anderson became interested in the project because he often played the game atarcades. The production company decided to hire him based on the accomplished visual flair ofShopping, which was filmed on a very low budget. Anderson, who at the time knew nothing aboutvisual effectsorfight scenes, had to study every book on visual effects that he could find and learned about filming the fight scenes while they were being shot, often consulting those who were experienced in fight choreography on set, such as Shou.
The film had extensive reshoots in order to add additional fights based on feedback fromtest screenings, which were attended by fans of the video game franchise. The production company decided to releaseMortal Kombatin August 1995, in the hope that the film would become a summer blockbuster.Mortal Kombatwas better received by critics, who gave it a mixed to negative reception.[9][10]Critics praised the atmosphere, visuals, and fighting sequences but criticized the plot, dialogue, and acting. It fared better with audiences and fans of the video games and scored a high A− on aCinemaScorepoll.[11]As a result, it spent three weeks as the highest-grossing film at the US box office and earned over $122 million worldwide, produced on a budget of $18 million. It proved a major success for Anderson and has been recognised as one of the first financially successful film adaptations of a video game.[12]Anderson and most cast members, including Lambert, declined to return for the sequel,Mortal Kombat Annihilation, which, when released, was critically panned and underperformed at the box office.[13]
The success ofMortal Kombatgave Anderson free rein to choose his next project, thescience fictionaction filmSoldier, written byBlade RunnerscreenwriterDavid Peoples. Peoples' script—and eventually the film itself—contains references to his work onBlade Runnerand can be considered to be taking place in the same universe, as asidequelorstandalone sequelof sorts.Kurt Russellbecame attached to star but decided to take some time off to build up his body, as required by the role, which delayed the production.[14]In the meantime, Anderson directed the 1997 science fictionhorror filmEvent Horizon, written byPhilip Eisnerand starringLaurence FishburneandSam Neill.
Despite praise for its visuals and production design, it was not well received by critics[15][16]or audiences (D+ on a Cinemascore poll),[11]and failed to break even, which Anderson blamed on a tight post-production schedule and studio-enforced cuts. It later sold well onhome videoand gained a smallcult following. Plans to complete adirector's cutrestoring thedeleted footagewere abandoned when it was discovered that most of it had been lost or degraded.[17][18][19]Soldierwas eventually completed and released in 1998 but was a critical and commercial disaster,[20][21]making less than $15 million in the US, on a budget of $60 million,[22]and releasingstraight-to-videoin several other markets. Anderson has expressed his regret that the planned location shoots had to be changed to studio soundstages due to theEl Niñohurricane, which ended up compromising the film's look. He also verbalized his disappointment withWarner Bros., whom he believes tried to market the film to the same male teen audience asMortal Kombat, rather than to grown-up audiences, including women.[23]
After his last two films' poor performances, Anderson was forced to put his plannedremakeof thecult filmDeath Race 2000on hold, and he set about writing and directing the 2000supernaturalmysterydramaTV filmThe Sight, starringAndrew McCarthy. It was meant as apilotfor a potential series,[24]but despite achieving high ratings,[25]it was not picked up. Anderson made his earlier films as "Paul Anderson", the name he registered with theDirectors Guild of America, but withThe Sight, he began crediting himself as "Paul W. S. Anderson", as filmmakerPaul Thomas Andersonhad registered himself with theWriters Guild of Americaas "Paul Anderson", making it impossible for either of them to both write and direct films as "Paul Anderson".[26]
Anderson returned to cinema screens in 2002 withResident Evil, a science fiction action horror film loosely based on theCapcomvideo game seriesof the same name. Anderson came up with the idea of adapting the games after playing the first couple of them for days in his apartment. BecauseConstantin Film, who had acquired the rights to the series, were not willing to spend more money than they already had on failed attempts (including a script byGeorge A. Romero),[27]Anderson convinced them to write the script, titledThe Undead,on spec. If they liked it, he would sell it to them as aResident Evilfilm; if not, he would take it elsewhere and try to make it unrelated to the games. He saw the film as being aprequelof sorts to the first game in the series and, as such, did not include any of the games' characters, a fact criticized by fans.[28]Instead, it starsMilla Jovovichas an original character,Alice.[29]Jovovich is the only actor that reprised her role in all of the series' first six live-action films. In comparison to Anderson's previous two films,Resident Evilwas produced on a moderate budget of $33 million and became a commercial success with a little over $100 million at the box office.[30]
It also performed strongly on home media. Critically,Resident Evilwas not received well,[31][32]although, similarly toMortal Kombat, some reviews characterized it as one of the better attempts at adapting a video game.[33][34][35][36]It received the "fair" rating of B by audiences on a Cinemascore poll.[11]Its relative popularity made Capcom put homages to it in video gamesResident Evil 4andResident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.[37][38]Anderson did not direct, but he wrote, produced, and was otherwise heavily involved with the making of two sequels,Resident Evil: Apocalypse(2004) andResident Evil: Extinction(2007), which completed the first of the eventual two trilogies ofResident Evilfilms. In the two sequels, Anderson began to introduce characters from the games, albeit in supporting roles compared to Alice.[28]Both films received similarly negative reviews to the first[39][40][41][42]but were even bigger commercial successes.[43][44]
Anderson's next project wasAlien vs. Predator, based on thecrossoverconceptof the same nameof theAlienandPredatorfranchises, popularized by a series ofDark Horse comicsand hinted at inPredator 2. A film version had been stuck indevelopment hellfor several years, despite the franchise's crossing into every other form of media, from books to comics to video games. Anderson directed the film from a script of his own, and it was released in 2004. It received negative reviews[45][46]and a B on a Cinemascore poll by audiences.[11]It was a big commercial success, however, grossing somewhat over $170 million on a $60 million budget.[47]A sequel was made,Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, in which Anderson was not involved, and which failed to match Anderson's film's commercial or even critical performance, a fact that Anderson has used to defend his film.[14]
After completingAlien vs. Predator, Anderson resumed work on his planned remake ofDeath Race 2000, which was released asDeath Racein 2008. The science fiction actionthrillerstarsJason Statham, and Anderson directed it based on his own screenplay. He refers to it as more of a prequel than a remake on the commentary of the home video releases. It received an average reception by critics[48][49]and scored a solid B+ on a Cinemascore poll.[11]It grossed little over $75 million on a budget of $45 million, failing to prove a commercial success on the level of Anderson's previous two films.[50]Anderson wrote and produced two straight-to-video prequels,Death Race 2(2011) andDeath Race 3: Inferno(2013), set before the events of the 2008 film. He later wrote and executive-producedDeath Race: Beyond Anarchy(2018), a sequel to the first film.
TheResident Evilproductions were criticized for unsafe filming and using shell companies to avoid liability.[51]During the filming ofResident Evil: The Final Chapter(2016), crew member Ricardo Cornelius died when he was caught beneath aHumveesliding off of a rotating platform. Stunt-woman Olivia Jackson lost most of an arm and was partially paralyzed when she collided with a camera crane during the filming of a motorcycle stunt in rain and freezing conditions. It was determined that she was wearing inadequate safety equipment and that the stunt's timing had been changed without her knowledge.[52]During the filming ofResident Evil: Retribution(2012), twelve extras were hospitalized with leg, neck, and back wounds after falling from a collapsing high-wheeled platform.[51]
In 2010, Anderson wrote and directed the first installment in a second trilogy ofResident Evilfilms, titledResident Evil: Afterlife. The film continues the storyline from where that last one ended. Anderson envisioned the new trilogy as a way to make use of a new stylistic approach, usingslow motionand3D.[53][54]Anderson filmed in native 3D, using the Sony F35 camera, mounted on theFusion Camera System, which was previously used inAvatar.[55]Despite negative reviews by critics[56][57]and a lukewarm B in a Cinemascore poll by audiences,[11]the film grossed $300 million on a budget of $60 million, making over $150 million that the previously most successful film in the franchise,Resident Evil: Extinction.
Anderson's next film was the 2011 3Dromanticactionadventure filmThe Three Musketeers, from a screenplay byAndrew Daviesand Alex Litvak based on the novelof the same name.Matthew Macfadyen,Ray Stevenson,Luke EvansandLogan Lerman, respectively, star as the characters from the novelAthos,Porthos,Aramis, andd'Artagnan, while Milla Jovovich playsMilady de Winter. Furthermore,Christoph Waltzstars asCardinal Richelieu,Orlando Bloomplays theDuke of BuckinghamandMads Mikkelsenappears asCaptain Rochefort.[58]The film failed to impress critics who reviewed it negatively[59][60]and scored a B on aCinemascorepoll.[11]Commercially it did not perform very well, grossing around $132–140 million on a reported budget that ranges between $75 and 90 million.[61][62]
Anderson wrote and directed the fifth installment in theResident Evilfilm franchise,Resident Evil: Retribution, in 2012. Anderson brought back several actors from the original trilogy of films to play alternate versions of their characters.[63][64]The film received generally negative reviews[65][66]and a C+ on a Cinemascore poll, the series' lowest.[11]Produced with a budget of $65 million, it grossed $240 million on the box office which is $60 million lower than the previous film's gross, but still overall larger than the grosses of each films of the original trilogy.[67]
In 2014, his 3Dhistoricaldisasterromance film namedPompeiiwas released. Inspired by theeruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79which destroyedPompeii, a city of theRoman Empire, the film was written by Janet Scott Batchler, Lee Batchler, and Michael Robert Johnson; it starsKit Harington,Emily Browning,Carrie-Anne Moss,Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje,Jessica Lucas, withJared Harris, andKiefer Sutherland.

In late 2016 inJapan, and early 2017 in the rest of the world, Anderson'sResident Evil: The Final Chapterwas released, which according to both him and Jovovich is the lastResident Evilfilm they will be involved with. Anderson designed the film "to come full circle", provide answers to some of the series' mysteries, and provide closure for the character of Alice. He decided to abandon the previous two films' stylistic approach of using slow motion in favor of a more fast and gritty feeling, and he also decided to convert the film in 3D in post, instead of filming with 3D cameras.[54]His first daughter with Jovovich, Ever Gabo Anderson, was cast in a double role, as both a young version of Alice and the character ofRed Queenintroduced in the original film.[73]The film received average to negative reviews, slightly better than the previous installments, and more along the lines of the original film.[74][75]It was rated B by audiences on a Cinemascore poll, which is the highest rating in the series, and shared with the first and second films.[11]The film grossed $312 million on a budget of $40 million,[76]in large part due to a record $94.3 million opening inChina,[77]making it Anderson's highest-grossing film.
In December 2020, Anderson directedMonster Hunter, based on Capcom'sMonster Huntervideo-game franchise. It was released in December 2020 after delays relating to theCOVID-19 pandemic, leading to a disappointing gross of $43 million against a $60 million budget;[78][79]and received mixed reviews.[80][81]

Peter V. Brett's fantasy novelThe Warded Manwas optioned for film production by Anderson and longtime producing partnerJeremy Bolt,[84]but a 2016 update of Brett's website said that they were no longer involved in the project.[85]
Anderson began datingMilla Jovovich, who starred inResident Evil, in 2002 after the film's release. He proposed to her in 2003; they were "engaged on-and-off for four years" before becoming a couple again early in 2007.[86][87][88]On 3 November 2007, Jovovich gave birth to their first child, daughterEver Anderson,[89]inLos Angeles.[90]Anderson and Jovovich married on 22 August 2009.[91]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
