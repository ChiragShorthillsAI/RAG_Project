After its Tribeca premiere, John DeFore ofThe Hollywood Reportergave a positive review by stating "Lost Transmissionsgave a sympathetic and appropriately downtempo look at a musician's mental illness. The film tells its story without engaging with foolish cliches about creativity and madness."[16]Joey Magidson ofHollywood Newsalso gave a positive review by stating "Simon Pegg and Juno Temple have never been better, exercising new acting muscles and causing you to re-evaluate what each is capable of."[17]Kristy Strouse ofFilm Inquirygave another positive review by stating "Lost Transmissionsreally finds its identity in the softer moments between our two leads, as the heartbreak comes to the surface and they acknowledge their own (and each other's) struggles."[18]Andy Howell ofFilm Threatfelt that viewers who "might seeLost Transmissionsjust for Simon Pegg will come away with a deeper sense of what schizophrenia is".[19]
Conversely, Alex Papaioannou ofPopaxiomgave a mixed review by stating "Lost Transmissionstakes the form of a bright spotlight that is necessary to expose harsh realities, and hopefully promote change. Unfortunately, there are times when these examples come off as misguided or played for laughs, which is upsetting whether intentional or not. This debut is a film about mental health and music, and while an important subject matter, it doesn't necessarily hit all the marks that it should. Still, Simon Pegg is absolutely fantastic and confirms his serious acting skills."[20]Owen GleibermanofVarietyalso gave a mixed review by stating "Lost Transmissionsis a murky and unfocused journey, set in a Los Angeles that looks as sodden as London on an overcast day."[21]
Emily Sears ofBirth.Movies.Death.gave a negative review by stating "The plot ofLost Transmissionslimits the performances, seesawing back and forth too often between Theo manipulating the system and Hannah being too stubborn to give up."[22]
The film won three awards at the 2020Prague Independent Film Festival— Grand Prix, Best Actor (Simon Pegg) and Best Actress (Juno Temple).[23]

She earned anEmmy Awardnomination for the TV filmThe Executioner's Song(1982). However, she was unhappy with the film's nude scene, remarking in an interview that the idea of the general public seeing her naked made her feel uncomfortable and exploited, and that most of the offers she had received since demanded that she similarly expose herself.[12]Her first starring role was inJohn Sayles's film,Baby It's You(1983), highly regarded byRotten Tomatoesreviewers[13]but not widely distributed.[14]She co-starred inDesperately Seeking Susan(1985) alongside pop superstarMadonna, for which Arquette won aBAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Roledespite appearing in the leading role.

TheTotosong "Rosanna" was written byDavid Paich, who has claimed that the song is based on numerous girls he had known. However, as a joke, the band members initially played along with the common assumption that the song was based on Arquette, who was dating Toto keyboard playerSteve Porcaroat the time. Arquette herself played along with the joke, commenting in an interview that the song was about "my showing up at 4 a.m., bringing them juice and beer at their sessions."[20]
Arquette was romantically involved withPeter Gabrielfor several years, after his 1987 divorce to his wife Jill Moore. Arquette has said on some occasions that his 1986 song "In Your Eyes" was inspired by her, although Gabriel has never confirmed that to be true, and has explained that he drew inspiration for the song from other sources.[21][22]Arquette's first three marriages—to director Tony Greco, film composerJames Newton Howard, and restaurateur John Sidel—ended in divorce.[23]She has one daughter with Sidel.[23]In August 2013, Arquette married her fourth husband, investment banker Todd Morgan, following a two-year engagement.[23]In January 2022, Todd Morgan filed for divorce from Arquette after 8 years of marriage.[24]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
