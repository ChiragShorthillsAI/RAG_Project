The film starsViola Davis,Chadwick Boseman,Glynn Turman,Colman Domingo, andMichael Potts. Inspired by the career ofMa Rainey, an influential blues singer and the title character, the film dramatizes a turbulent recording session in 1920s Chicago.
Produced byDenzel Washington,Todd Black, and Dany Wolf, the project was originally announced alongside Washington'sFencesin 2013 as part of his ten-picture deal withHBO. The adaptation eventually moved toNetflixand filming began inPittsburghin 2019. Boseman died during post-production in August 2020, makingBlack Bottomhis final film appearance. The film is dedicated to his memory.
Ma Rainey's Black Bottombegan a limited theatrical release on November 25, 2020, before beginning to stream on Netflix on December 18. Critics praised the performances of Davis, Boseman, and Turman as well as the costume design and production values. It was named as one of the ten best films of 2020 by theAmerican Film Institute.[4]The film received five nominations at the93rd Academy Awards, includingBest Actor(for Boseman),Best Actress(for Davis), and won two awards:Makeup and HairstylingandCostume Design.[5]Additionally, the film received eightCritics' Choice Movie Awardnominations and nineNAACP Image Awardnominations, includingOutstanding Motion Picture,[6]with Davis and Boseman both winning lead acting awards.

Ma Raineyis a highly regarded, strong-willed blues singer who has recently been contracted by white producers to record an album. The story takes place on July 2, 1927, when the first recording session is scheduled for Ma by her manager Irvin to take place atParamount's Recording Studios in Chicago. Seasoned Georgia Jazz Band members Toledo, Cutler, and Slow Drag arrive on time without Ma, which frustrates producer Mel Sturdyvant. They are soon joined by Levee Green, the band's overconfident trumpeter, who has shown Sturdyvant his original compositions in the hopes of getting his own record deal. The other musicians find Levee's behavior disrespectful to Ma. Teased by the rest of the band about his ability to deal with white men, Levee relates how his mother was gang-raped in front of him. His father killed four of the rapists but was then lynched and burned.
Ma arrives an hour late with her lady friend, Dussie Mae, and her nephew, Sylvester. Immediately, she clashes with Sturdyvant and Irvin, making numerous demands. Insulted that theCoca-Colashe requested has not been provided, Ma refuses to sing until Slow Drag and Sylvester bring her one. Later, she insists to Sturdyvant that the opening words of the album be spoken by Sylvester (who has a pronouncedstutter) so he can receive royalties. As a result, the group has to do multiple takes of the song “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom," much to everyone's frustration.
Ma confides to Cutler that her white bosses are only interested in her voice and would otherwise regard her as "just a dog in the alley", which he understands and sympathizes with. Meanwhile, Levee and Dussie Mae have sex in the practice room before being interrupted by Slow Drag.
The group finally manages to get through the first track after multiple takes, but discovers an equipment failure has caused it not to be recorded. The band blames Levee, who they think tripped over a wire while eyeing Dussie Mae, though it is revealed to have been damaged already. Their argument leads the religious Cutler to tell a story about a preacher he once knew who got stranded in a small town and was humiliated by a group of white men who tore up his Bible and forced him to dance. Levee brushes off the story by retorting that if there was a God, he would care for black people, which he never has. Cutler attacks Levee in anger, and the young man forces him back with a knife while continuing to belittle his beliefs.
The group finally finishes recording, but Ma fires Levee soon afterward, believing his reckless ambition and uncompromising attitude to be detrimental to the band. Levee meets with Sturdyvant about his original songs, but learns that the producer will only buy the rights and never intended to give him a deal. Levee subsequently suffers a mental breakdown and, after Toledo accidentally steps on his new shoes, fatally stabs him in the back with the knife. Cutler and Slow Drag leave in horror as Levee cradles Toledo's corpse. Later, Sturdyvant records Levee's songs with a band consisting entirely of white musicians (supposedlyPaul Whiteman's Orchestra).

Wolfeset to direct.[9]In July 2019,Taylour Paige,Jonny Coyne,Jeremy Shamos, and Dusan Brown joined the cast of the film.[10]Maxayn Lewisdid most of Rainey's singing for Davis.[11]Jeffrey Wrightwas originally expected to join the film.[12]
Filming commenced on July 8, 2019 in Pittsburgh, with sets converted into 1927 Chicago, and wrapped on August 16, 2019.[13]
On August 28, 2020, Boseman died of colon cancer during post-production, makingMa Rainey's Black Bottomhis final film appearance. The film is dedicated to him.[14][15][16]
The film was theatrically released in select theaters on November 25, 2020,[14]before beginning to stream on December 18, on Netflix.[17]Netflix also released a 31-minute making-of documentaryMa Rainey's Black Bottom: A Legacy Brought to Screenalongside the film.[18]Upon its digital release to Netflix, the film was the most-watched item over its opening weekend.[19]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 301 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Framed by a pair of powerhouse performances,Ma Rainey's Black Bottompays affectionate tribute to a blues legend — and Black culture at large."[20]According toMetacritic, which compiled 46 reviews and calculated a weighted average score of 87 out of 100.[21]
For theLos Angeles Times,Justin Changwrote "Boseman, evincing the same integrity he clung to his entire career, refuses to soft-pedal the destination. He imparts to this seething, shattered man the gift of a broken soul, driven by anger and trauma, and makes him all the more human for it. His final moments of screen time are among his darkest, and also his finest."[22]Eric Kohn ofIndieWiregave the film a "B" grade and praised Davis and Boseman's performances, saying: "All of this would be more concerning ifMa Rainey's Black Bottomdidn't turn on Wilson's crackling dialogue and a jazzy pace on par with the music. Above all, the movie amounts to a solid resurrection that doesn't muck up the bulk of what made the play click in the first place."[23]
Peter Travers, reviewing the film forABC News, said: "Davis plays the real-life Ma Rainey, the Georgia singer dubbed the Mother of the Blues. Boseman invests body and soul into Levee, the hot-headed trumpeter who dares to lock horns with Ma in a shabby Chicago recording studio where they're paid to make music the way the white bosses want it. The time is 1927, but the bristling racial tensions feel as timely as ever."[24]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
