Synchronicis a 2019 Americanscience fictionhorror filmdirected and produced byJustin Benson and Aaron Moorhead. Written by Benson, the film shares continuity with other films by Benson and Moorhead, followingResolutionandThe Endless.SynchronicstarsAnthony MackieandJamie Dornanas paramedics who investigate a series of inexplicable deaths and their connection to a newdesigner drug.
It had its world premiere at the2019 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released on October 23, 2020, byWell Go USA Entertainment.
Steve, a womanizing New Orleansparamedic, and his devoted partner, Dennis, face a string of deaths all linked to a newdesigner drug, Synchronic. When Steve is accidentally pricked by a contaminated needle during a call, tests reveal not only possible infection but also an aggressive cancer in his underdevelopedpineal gland.
Driven to uncover the truth about Synchronic, Steve tracks down the drug's creator. He learns it warps the pineal gland'sperception of time, sending users backwards through history. Children experience full time travel, while adults exist only asghost-likefiguresin the past.
Meanwhile, Dennis's teenage daughter, Brianna, vanishes. His marriage collapses and he misjudges Steve, whose declining health and painkiller use he mistakes for drug addiction. Their conflict turns into a physical fight.
Fueled by his diagnosis and a desire to find Brianna, Steve experiments with Synchronic. He witnesses Louisiana's past, escaping encounters with aconquistadorand theKu Klux Klan. Using his dog, Hawking, he discovers the location of pill consumption dictates the destination year. But Hawking is lost in the 1920s, unable to return with Steve.
Steve deduces that physical contact with objects can anchor someone in a specific time. Returning to the park where Brianna disappeared, he encountersprehistorictribesmen but learns Brianna might have simply wandered off before taking Synchronic.
Reconciling with Dennis, Steve reveals his cancer diagnosis. Joined by their colleague Tom, they review Steve's time-travel footage and rush to thecemeterywhere Steve's family is buried. From there, they journey back to the park.
Within the chaos of theAmerican Civil War, Steve locates a terrified Brianna. When a looter, mistaking Steve for arunaway slave, threatens them, Steve sacrifices himself as a distraction so Brianna can use his last pill to return to the present. Fatally injured and the looter killed by a landmine, Steve carves the word "ALLWAYS" into a boulder. This act casts him as the originator of the symbol found there in the present.
Dennis embraces a safely returned Brianna, as Steve'sspectral formlingers. His journey complete, Steve bids a peaceful farewell.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
