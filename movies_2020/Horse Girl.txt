Sarah, an introverted young woman, regularly visits the grave of her mother, who committed suicide. She also frequents thehorse stablewhere her former horse Willow is boarded, and where she rode in her childhood.
After finding Sarah home alone on her birthday, Sarah's roommate Nikki invites her boyfriend Brian and his roommate, Darren, over for a double date. The four smokemarijuanaand have drinks. The date is interrupted by Sarah's nose bleeding. After Darren leaves, Sarah has a dream in which she lays face up in a white room. A man and woman also lay down some distance away from her, unaware of their surroundings.
The following morning, Nikki awakens to find Sarah sleeping on the living room floor and large scratch marks running across the wall. Darren returns to the apartment to retrieve his car and asks Sarah on a date. At work, she has another nose bleed. While recovering, she recognizes Ron, a man walking outside who resembles the one from her dream. Later, Sarah spends an afternoon with her childhood friend Heather who suffered a traumaticbrain injuryin a riding accident. Heather has recurrentseizuresand short-term memory loss.
While driving home, Sarah stops at a red light near a water facility. She then finds herself in her kitchen with the tap running, unable to account for the elapsed time. She later hears a woman talking indistinctly in another room when no one is home. She then finds that her car has been stolen from her garage.
Gary, Sarah's wealthy stepfather, learns that the car has appeared at a tow yard, as the registration is still in his name. He brings her to retrieve it, and the tow driver reveals that the car was abandoned near a water facility in the middle of the road.
Later, Sarah apparentlysleepwalksout of her apartment and awakens standing outside by atelephone booth. At her apartment, she discovers that somehow only a couple minutes had passed. At work, her boss Joan suggests that she visit a doctor given her familial history of mental health problems.
Sarah becomes convinced that she is experiencingalien abductions. Due to her striking resemblance to her deceased grandmother, Sarah fears that she may be her clone. Meanwhile, she tracks Ron to a plumbing store that he owns. While on a date with Darren, Sarah manically confides her belief that she is a clone and has him drive her to her mother's grave to dig her up and retrieve herDNA. Sarah eventually accuses a disturbed Darren of plotting against her, and threatens him with scissors, forcing him to leave her there.
Sarah takes a shower at home, but soon finds herself walking through the back door to her work. Joan helps her and calls the police, after which Sarah is admitted to apsychiatric hospital. She awakens in the middle of the night to find the door to her room unlocked. Escaping from the hospital, she visits various places. At the crafts store she works at, Sarah steals fabric and crafts protective suits for herself and Willow, but is confronted by the stable owner when she goes to deliver Willow's suit. Fleeing, she visits a sympathetic Darren, and the two begin to have sex, after which he disappears.
She creates a doorway out of fabric and enters through it into the white room. There, she seesshadowy figurestending to unconscious people, including herself and the two other people from her dreams. She exits through a window into Heather's bedroom and joins her in bed, but awakens the next morning to find herself back in the hospital, implying that everything since her escape was part of a dream. She recognizes another patient in her room as the woman from her dream; when Sarah describes it, the woman reveals that they share elements in their dreams, such as an alien ramp in the middle of the ocean. Sarah takes this as confirmation of her belief that they are both alien abductees and joyfully tells her social worker that she is not delusional. Despite the social worker's reservations, Sarah is discharged after 72 hours.
At home, Sarah dresses in her grandmother's dress. She steals Willow from the stable and walks with her into the woods. In a clearing, Sarah stops and lies on the ground. A spaceship then appears; shelevitatestoward the sky and disappears.

Jeffrey Lance Baena(/ˈbeɪnə/; June 29, 1977 – January 3, 2025) was an American screenwriter and film director. His most successful films were 2004'sI Heart Huckabeesand 2020'sHorse Girl, though his projects to receive the most contemporary critical acclaim were the 2016 and 2017 filmsJoshyandThe Little Hours. Baena frequently worked with his wifeAubrey Plaza, writing partnerAlison Brie, andMolly Shannon.
He began his career as a screenwriter, co-writing the 2004 comedy filmI Heart Huckabeesand, around the same time, seeing his script forLife After Bethenter production before being shelved. Baena, as anindependent filmmaker, expanded to directing a decade later and filmedLife After Bethas his directorial debut, starring Aubrey Plaza and released in 2014. Working with producerLiz Destro, and reuniting with Plaza as well as an expanding group of frequent collaborators, Baena was then writer-director forJoshy(2016) andThe Little Hours(2017), which both became critically acclaimed and found acult audience.
Among the performers in these films was Alison Brie, with whom Baena struck up a writing partnership and created works produced byDuplass Brothers Productions. They made the 2020 psychological drama filmHorse Girltogether, Baena's most commercial film, followed by the television anthology seriesCinema Toast(2021) and Baena's final film, 2022'sSpin Me Round. His first films saw Baena implement his post-mumblecorestyle as an improvisation-heavy filmmaker, and his films co-written with Brie are marked by exploration of expectations in film form.
Jeffrey Lance Baena was born inMiamion June 29, 1977,[1][2]to Barbara (later Stern) and Scott Baena.[3]He was raised in asecular Jewishfamily[4][5]in the suburbs ofKendallandCoral Gables, where he enjoyed being surrounded byLatin and Caribbeancultures; he later said that he "felt a sense of community" there, a contrast to the negative perception of drug cartel violence.[6]His family was fromNew York Cityand had moved to Miami due to his father's work as a lawyer. Baena's parents were divorced, which he credited in part with informing his dark sense of comedy.[7]His first stepmother wasmanic depressiveand, under Florida'sBaker Act, was frequently institutionalized but then released, with Baena later commenting on systemic challenges in mental health care.[8]He had a brother and two step-siblings.[3]
AfterKillian High School,[9]Baena graduated from theNew York University Tisch School of the Artswith a degree in film, before moving toLos Angelesto pursue directing.[10]He, without really intending, achieved a minor inmedieval studiesat NYU after taking multiple classes when he "was hard-core into thealchemyshit",[5]and also took classes relating to philosophy.[7]
Baena was aproduction assistantfor filmmakerRobert ZemeckisonWhat Lies BeneathandCast Away(both 2000).[11][12]Both films were shot back-to-back and Zemeckis then took a production break, causing Baena to seek other employment.[13]He became an assistanteditorand, later,personal assistantfor writer-directorDavid O. Russell.[11][14]Baena was originally hired to help edit online documentaryBenny Hernandezbefore Russell asked him to contribute some writing ideas for it; the project was ultimately left unfinished.[13][15]After a year and a half of working together, a minor car accident injured one of Baena's eyes. Partially to keep his spirits up and pass the time during his recovery, Russell began discussing story ideas with Baena. The two ended upcollaborating on four scripts together, includingI Heart Huckabees, which Russell directed in 2004, andJay Roach'sMeet the Fockers(also 2004), for which they made uncredited revisions.[11][16]: 146–147The philosophicalI Heart Huckabeeswas noted for the ambition in its storytelling;[17][18][19][20]it was not a commercial success,[21][22]and polarized critics.[20][23]By 2005 it had become acult hit,[21][9]soon finding a place in the pop culture zeitgeist,[20]and in 2023Robbie Collinand Tim Robey wrote it was one of the bestbox-office bombs, citing its rewatchability two decades later.[24]
Before he began directing, Baena continued working as a screenwriter, mostly forstudio assignmentsandrewrites.[25][26]Warner Bros. Picturesappointed him the screenwriter for the comedyThe Awakening of Jean-Luc Barbarain 2006,[27][28]which was still in development in 2010.[29]He performed rewrites on Rami andEtan Cohen'sRevenge of the Jocks, a reverse take onRevenge of the Nerds, in 2011. At the same time he was writing an indieadaptation oftheErnest HemingwaymemoirA Moveable Feast.[30]Having always wanted to be a director, Baena considered screenwriting "a means to an end" and was critical of his own writing ability.[31]In 2012, he co-judged a short film script competition curated byRoman Coppola,[32]and played a version of himself in the filmThe End of Love;[33]a dramatization of actorMark Webber's life, Baena appeared inThe End of LovealongsideAubrey Plaza, his partner and Webber'sScott Pilgrim vs. the Worldco-star.[34][35]
Baena had planned for the comedy-dramaJoshyto be his directorial debut, but actor and collaboratorAdam Pallyhad to postpone for personal reasons. Baena then decided to work on the zombie comedyLife After Beth, from a script he started writing in 2003,[36]which became his debut.[37][38]This film had been in production but shelved shortly after it was written, and was only picked back up after comic actress Aubrey Plaza was looking for a role and her agent remembered the script; with Plaza attached, the production resumed.Flavorwirewrote that "Baena's control of the material is occasionally uncertain",[39]whileMark Kermodefelt Baena "kept things just the right side of believable, eschewing explanation in favour of cracked domesticity."[40]Life After Bethreceived mixed reviews; theRotten Tomatoes(RT) critics' consensus suggested the idea was too thin to sustain a whole film, though bolstered by Plaza's performance.[41]In 2016, it was ranked the 38th best everzombie filmand described as both "the bestzom-rom-comsinceShaun Of The Dead" and a "mumblecorerelationship break-up zomcom".[42]It premiered at theSundance Film Festivalin2014,[37][38]the same festival at whichJoshy, as Baena's second film, premiered in2016.[11]
AfterLife After Beth, Baena worked on adaptingLysergic, the autobiography ofKrystle Colethat he hadoptioned,[43][44]and suggested he might like to directDoctor Strangeas he was a fan ofthe character.[13]When production resumed onJoshy, Baena provided his large comedic cast with a 20-page outline, rather than a script, as an experiment to "keep people in the moment." Baena did not audition but cast people he knew would be able to work in such a film.[45]The film's RT critics' consensus highlighted Baena's direction for "strik[ing] a unique, disarmingly heartfelt blend of dark humor and tragedy".[46]TheLos Angeles Timespraised that despite its improvisational nature, "the film never feels unfocused or messy";[47]Christy Lemirefelt Baena's work had improved since his debut;[48]andGlenn Kennynoted Baena's skill in tonally dictating his film.[49]Joshywas ranked the fifth best ever mumblecore film separately by screenwriter Jason Hellerman and critic Mike Bedard,[50][51]with Bedard also describing it as "post-mumblecore".[52]
Jake Johnsonas well as some of Baena's filmmaker friends had acting roles inJoshy;[9]the previous year, Baena had similarly made a cameo in Johnson's 2015 filmDigging for Fire,[53]the premise of which was based on the strange things found when Johnson, Baena and friends had dug out Johnson's garden.[54]Joshywas also Baena's first film to feature actressAlison Brie, albeit briefly,[48]before she had a main role inThe Little Hours.Baena's third film, a 2017black comedy,The Little Hoursalso starred Plaza;[55]he wrote in aReddit AMAthat he "made this movie for [Plaza]",[56]for whom it was herproducingdebut[57]alongsideLiz Destroof Destro Films. Destro had produced Baena's previous films,[58]with Baena only starting development ofThe Little Hoursafter pitching it to her. Inspired by passages fromThe Decameron, which Baena had studied,[59]the film was again largely improvised and based in the disconnect of medieval beliefs to modern ones; Baena saw the potential for humor[5]and tragedy in this idea.[60]Reviews were impressed with how well the concept worked,[61][62][63][64]and praised Baena's comedic direction,[65][66][67]withMick LaSallewriting that "Baena combines a zany comic vision with a rare control of tone. [...] There's no winking or nudging, no straining for laughs. Baena devised the material, and he trusts it."[68]
Baena directed Brie two more times in the filmsHorse Girl(2020) andSpin Me Round(2022), which they co-wrote together. The latter also featured Plaza.[69][70]Both actresses were involved in different capacities in Baena's only television work,Cinema Toast, a 2021anthology seriesthat he created andexecutive produced. Baena wrote and directed episodes in the series, which reinterpretedpublic domainfootage to tell modern stories.[71][3]Baena and Brie were among the producers forCinema Toastand both of their co-written films, all of which were executive produced by theDuplass Brothers.[71][72][73]
Having formed a friendship after working on previous movies, and knowing of the creative risks Baena liked to take, Brie pitched the idea for a drama about fear of mental illness to him while on a hike. He had been suggesting that she play a "horse girl" character, and they realized they could combine the ideas to create what becameHorse Girl.[74]The pair pitched it to the Duplass Brothers, who joined and offered it toNetflix.[75]Baena and Brie wrote the screenplay together, and some of the film's dialogue was improvised. After premiering at Sundance in2020,Horse Girlbegan streaming on Netflix[76]and was the most commercially successful of Baena's works.[77]Reviews noted the use and subversion offormto inform the story,[78]which was generally praised[79][80][72]but also criticized by Adrian Horton inThe Guardian.[81]
The pair again chose to subvert expectations inSpin Me Round, the shoot of which was postponed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic in Italy. They used the delay to expand the film outline into a more detailed script.[82][83]The film combined comedy and thriller genres, and critics noted the story for "a provocative#MeToostatement".[73][83]Spin Me Roundsaw mixed reviews, its RT critics' consensus saying that "it never quite lives up to its potential" but is nevertheless enjoyable and elevated by Plaza and Brie.[84]The Hollywood Reporterfelt it was "amusing but the most lightweight" of Baena's films.[85]
Baena's films found a cult audience,[61]and critics appreciated the attention and care Baena gave to topics that were not frequently tackled in Hollywood films: Baena's films broadly deal with themes of grief, loss, love and mental health.[60][8][7]In his own words, he described them as "destabilizing, unmoored, and full of chaos";[82]literary authorWilliam Deresiewiczwrote they are "odd, generically hybrid, tonally complex".[86]Despite some similarities – his first two directorial efforts,Life After BethandJoshy, are comedies that explore how a character copes after the death of their partner[60][87][88]– and Baena's films all sharing "some unforeseen emotional kick", Ryan Gilbey wrote in an obituary forThe Guardianthat "the subjects and styles were strikingly dissimilar, a fact on which [Baena] prided himself" as he did not want to do the same thing again.[9]Baena enjoyed creative freedom to mix genres and expectations,[82]and preferred not to use labels for his works so as to not create expectations.[86]
He "never really audition[ed], ever" for his films, saying he was inspired byFederico Fellinichoosing performers based on seeing them in a more natural setting than a line reading. Baena created ideas of characters then, once he knew which actors he would use, would "try to build the part around them, and ... make it more true."[45]He ended up with a group of frequent collaborators, particularly Brie, Plaza andMolly Shannon(who each starred in four of his five films),[83][82]as well as Pally,John C. Reilly,Lauren Weedman,Fred Armisen,Paul Reiser,Paul WeitzandDebby Ryan[55][9][89][90][91][92]– Baena said this was primarily because he enjoyed working with them and always wanted to bring out new things from actors he enjoyed. He also found it advantageous to work with familiar actors due to his own "slightly nontraditional way" of writing and directing, so that he could rely on performers who understood his process.[82]Baena typically wrote and worked from film outlines, rather than full screenplays, so his films could incorporateimprovisation, though his first and final films,Life After BethandSpin Me Round, were more traditional.[45][82]He was considered one of the prominent filmmakers of the mumblecore subgenre.[50][52]
Baena was renowned for the game nights he hosted, creating a social environment among filmmakers and friends that was reflected on his film sets.[93]He met actressAubrey Plazaduring a game night in 2011,[9]after which they began dating.[94]Baena proposed to Plaza at a site related to theBasque witch trialsinZugarramurdi.[95][96]They were married in 2021, to celebrate their tenth anniversary together, in a small ceremony in their backyard.[94][10]
On January 3, 2025, Baena's body was discovered at his home in Los Angeles by his assistant. He was pronounced dead at the scene.[97]The Los Angeles County medical examiner reported the cause of death assuicide by hanging. Baena was 47.[98][99]The82nd Golden Globe Awardsceremony was held on January 5, withBest DirectorwinnerBrady Corbetpaying tribute to Baena at the end of his acceptance speech;[100]Plaza had been set to present at the ceremony but pulled out.[34]Baena's funeral took place on January 10, 2025, in Miami.[101]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
