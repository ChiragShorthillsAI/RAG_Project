Years later,Tommy Stubbins, a young boy, accidentally wounds ared squirrelnamed Kevin while out with his hunter father. He finds himself led to Dolittle's home by hismacawPolynesia, who hopes his arrival will help Dolittle reconnect with humans.
At the same time, Queen Victoria dispatches her maid of honor, Lady Rose, to seek Dolittle's help when she falls seriously ill. After treating Kevin, Dolittle agrees to see Victoria, after Poly reveals he will lose his home to theTreasuryif the queen dies.
At her palace, Dolittle finds Victoria being tended to by his lifelong rival, Dr. Blair Müdfly. Examining her himself in the presence of Müdfly and Lord Thomas Badgley, a member of the House of Lords, he discovers she was poisoned withnightshadeand can only be cured with themagical fruitfrom theEden Tree.
Dolittle mounts an expedition to handle this, leaving hisdogJipand his stick insect Styx to keep an eye on the Queen while he is away. Although he takes along several animals for the journey, includingChee-Cheethegorilla, Yoshi thepolar bear, and Poly, he refuses to take Tommy.
Poly, refusing to let Tommy be left behind, sends Betsy thegiraffeand Tutu thefoxto collect him. He manages to reach the ship and helps out after beginning to learn how to talk to animals, especially when Müdfly begins pursuing Dolittle to impede his efforts.
To track down the fruit, Dolittle brings his expedition to Monteverde, ruled over by Lily's father King Rassouli, to recover her journal. He believes that it will help lead the way to the site where the fruit is found. However, Rassouli apprehends Dolittle when he tries to steal the journal and locks him in with a moodytigernamed Barry.
While Tommy works to recover the journal, Dolittle stalls Barry until Chee-Chee locates him and finds the courage to defeat him. Although the group acquire the journal, Müdfly steals it and destroys their ship. Rassouli, learning that Dolittle is trying to honour Lily's memory with his expedition, and he also misses her, loans him a ship to chase after Müdfly.
Both parties eventually reach the island of the Eden Tree, only to find it is guarded by thedragonessGinko-Who-Soars. Although it attacks the groups, causing Müdfly to fall down a hole, it soon collapses from internal pain. Dolittle diagnoses and cures the dragon, causing Ginko to gratefully reward him access to the tree and its fruit.
Dolittle returns in time to cure Victoria, before revealing that Badgley had poisoned her to take the crown for himself. The queen has him sent to theTower of Londonfor treason, thanking Dolittle for saving her.
Returning home, Dolittle re-opens it to others, while taking on Tommy as his apprentice.

The film went through 21 days ofre-shootsin April 2019 following poor test screenings. DirectorJonathan Liebesmanhelped to oversee the filming alongsideGaghan, whileChris McKaywrote new material after it became clear from first cuts that the comedy elements of the film were not coming together as well as the producers had hoped.[3]Prior to this, Universal had turned towardsSeth RogenandNeighborsco-writerBrendan O'Briento help add comedy to the film, but neither could remain committed to the project and dropped out. McKay was assigned to storyboard sequences and assemble different edits before later leaving to instead directThe Tomorrow War. Liebesman took over McKay's duties and finished the film alongside Gaghan.The Lego Batman MoviescribeJohn Whittingtonhad also performed rewrites on the script amid reshoots, and flew toLondonto meet with Downey, who allegedly tore Whittington's script apart in favor of "new ideas".The Hollywood Reporterstated that despite a "challenged production", there were no fights for power and no competing cuts for the film.[16]The film's title was changed fromThe Voyage of Doctor Dolittleto simplyDolittlein August.[17]The film was budgeted at $175 million before reshoots.[3]According to financial statements analyzed byForbesthe film spent a total of $233.6 million, with a net cost of $192.4 million after UK tax credits.[4]
In January 2020, onJoe Rogan's podcastThe Joe Rogan Experience, Downey Jr. discussed the inspiration for the Dr. Dolittle character in the film, which he said stemmed from aWelshneo-pagan physician calledWilliam Price: "Same way I did with Iron Man... before I signed on, I was just googling 'weirdest Welsh doctor', I just wanted to think of, I don't want to just do another English accent.. so there was this guy called William Price, who's a nutty Welsh doctor, he was a neo-druidist, he believed that he could communicate with all nature and all that stuff, so I sent a picture of this wild looking guy wearing this kind of suit with stars on it and like a staff in his hand [to Gaghan]... and he goes, "That looks good to me" and I was like "great let's do this movie"".[18]
Music artistSiaperformed a new song of hers, "Original", for the end credits, while Danny Elfman composed the film's score.[19]
The film was released byUniversal Pictures. It was originally set for May 24, 2019, but was moved to April 12 of that year, to avoid competition withStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which itself was later moved from May to December 20, 2019. The film was later moved again to January 17, 2020.[20]
Dolittlewas released onDigital HDon March 24, 2020, and onDVD,Blu-ray, andUltra HD Blu-rayon April 7.[21]As of July 12, 2020, the film had made $14.3 million in home media sales.[5]
Dolittlegrossed $77 million in the United States and Canada, and $174.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $251.5 million.[5]Due to its high production and marketing costs,The New York Observerestimated that the film needed to gross over $500 million worldwide tobreak even;[22]following its debut weekend, it was estimated the film would lose Universal between $50–100 million.[23][24]
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongsideBad Boys for Life, and was projected to gross $20–22 million from 4,155 theaters in its three-day opening weekend, and a total of around $27 million over the full four-dayMartin Luther King Jr. Dayweekend.[25][26]It made $6.3 million on its first day, including $925,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $22 million for three days, and $29.5 million over the four-day frame, finishing second, behindBad Boys for Life.[23]The film made $12.1 million in its second weekend and $7.7 million in its third, remaining in second both times.[27][28]
After months of delays, the film was released in China on July 24, and made $5.2 million from about 3,000 screens in its opening weekend.[29]By August 6, the film had reached $14.6 million in grosses in the country.[30]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 15% based on 242 reviews, with an average rating of 4/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "Dolittlemay be enough to entertain very young viewers, but they deserve better than this rote adaptation's jumbled story and stale humor."[31]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 26 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[32]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, whilePostTrakreported an average of 3 out of 5 stars from viewers they surveyed.[23]
Courtney Howard ofVarietycalled the film a "frenetic, crass kids' flick" and wrote: "What should have been an awe-filled adventure quickly curdles into an awful one, thanks to a pedestrian formula and the filmmakers' fixation on fart jokes".[33]Writing forThe Hollywood Reporter,Todd McCarthysaid: "From the very first scene, it's clear something is terribly off with this lavishly misbegotten attempt to repopularize an animal-loaded literary franchise that was born exactly a century ago. The oddly diffident star and executive producer Robert Downey Jr. never finds the power-supplying third rail needed to energize a tale that fails to make a real case for being reinterpreted".[34]
British criticMark Kermodegave the film a negative review: "Terrible script. Terrible visuals. Dull plot. Dismal gags. The fact (is) that at 101 minutes it really, really tested one's patience. It is shockingly poor".[35]In examining the film's ending, Lisa Laman ofScreen Rantnoted that the film as a whole suffered from numerous problems, including "...Dolittle's new backstory involving a deceased wife...the largely lifeless voice-over work of the animal characters [and] its painfully unfunny comedy".[36]
Much of the criticism focused on Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the character with a Welsh accent, which the actor himself called "the single hardest accent on Earth". Mark Kermode derided the attempt, comparing it unfavourably with Welsh actor Michael Sheen's English accent, calling it "something from Mars" and suggesting the film had been heavilydubbed.[37]Welsh reviewers were more mixed. Simon Thompson praised the attempt, stating "it's a brave choice, I take my hat off to Robert Downey Jr. for going for it" and "as flawed as it is, it warmed the cockles of my heart to hear a Welsh accent in the cinema".[38]Another Welsh reviewer said that appraisal of the accent "depends on how much love you have for him in attempting to do it in the first place", arguing that he had "clearly swotted up onthe dialect, dropping in random phrases like"tidy"and"mun", along with"I'll be there in a minute now"and"twty down"".[39]
A segment in the film in which Dolittle removes bagpipes from Ginko-Who-Soars'anus, inducingflatulence, was criticised as "gross" and "disgusting".[40][41][42]In a retrospective article,The Telegraphcalled it "a set-piece that will be forever seared into the minds of those unfortunate enough to sit through it".[43]
Robert Downey Jr. later referred to the movie as "a two-and-a-half-year wound of squandered opportunity", and noted that its troubled production and failure led to a major rethinking of his career and life.[44]

During the release ofTraffic, a critic commented on one of the teen characters in the movie who is a drug addict and a straight-A student, calling it unrealistic, which Gaghan defended by stating that he had straight A's while he was addicted to drugs and alcohol. As Gaghan wrote in an article published inNewsweekin February 2001, "I wasn't much different from my peers, except where they could stop drinking after three or six or 10 drinks, I couldn't stop and wouldn't stop until I had progressed through marijuana, cocaine, heroin and, finally, crack and freebase--which seem for so many people to be the last stop on the elevator." Gaghan has stated that he began dealing with his addictions in 1997. "Over one long, five-day weekend, I had three separate heroin dealers get arrested," he said. "My dealer, my backup dealer and my backup-backup dealer. I was left alone, and I just hit that place, that total incomprehensible demoralization. That was the end of it; up five days straight, locked in the bathroom, convinced there was nowhere else to go, I had to kill myself, I'm going to kill myself. I just couldn't take another minute of it."[7]

Other writing credits includeRules of Engagement(2000),Havoc(2005), andThe Alamo(2004), as well as a handful of episodes of various television series. Gaghan turned down the chance to adaptDan Brown's novel,The Da Vinci Code.

Five years later, he went on to appear in the director's comedic thrillerLaw of Desire(1987), making headlines with his performance as a gay man, which required him to engage in his first male-to-male onscreen kiss. Banderas appeared in Almodóvar'ssurrealistsex comedyMatador,withVincent CanbyofThe New York Timeswriting, "The movie looks terrific and is acted with absolute, straight-faced conviction by the excellent cast headed by Miss Serna, Mr. Martinez and Mr. Banderas."[7]
The director cast him in his internationally acclaimed 1988 film,Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. Rita Kemply ofThe Washington Postdescribed Banderas' performance as "warm" and described the film as a "glossy delight."[8]The recognition Banderas gained for his role increased years later, when he starred in Almodóvar's controversialTie Me Up!

In 1991,Madonnaintroduced Banderas to Hollywood. (He was an object of her desires in her pseudodocumentary film of one of her concert tours,Madonna: Truth or Dare.)[11]The following year, still speaking minimal English, he began acting in American films. Despite having to learn all his lines phonetically, Banderas still managed to turn in a critically praised performance as a struggling musician in his first American drama film,The Mambo Kings(1992).[12]Kenneth TuranofThe Los Angeles Timesdescribed Banderas as giving a "quietly effective job".[13]David Nansen ofNewsweekdeclared, "Banderas had to learn English to play this role, but you wouldn't know it: he plumbs all the nuances of charm and self-pity in Nestor's melancholic soul".[14]Owen Gleiberman ofEntertainment Weeklyalso praised Banderas' performance writing, "he gives a surprisingly confident and subtle performance as the implosive Nestor".[15]
Banderas then broke through to mainstream American audiences in the 1993Jonathan DemmefilmPhiladelphiaas the life partner of lawyerTom HanksandDenzel Washington.  Also in 1993, he acted in theBille August-directedThe House of the Spirits,an adaptation of theIsabel Allendenovel of the same name.

The film was a financial success.[17]Owen Gleiberman ofEntertainment Weeklywrote, "The movie’s greatest visual coup... is Banderas himself. The camera loves this velvet stud as much as it did the youngClint Eastwood."[18]
That same year, Banderas portrayed the antagonist in theRichard Donner-directed action filmAssassins, co-starring oppositeSylvester StalloneandJulianne Moore.[19]In 1996, he starred alongsideMadonnain the musical filmEvita, an adaptation of the stage musical byAndrew Lloyd WebberandTim Ricein which he played the narrator, Che, a role played byDavid Essexin the original 1978 West End production.Janet MaslinofThe New York Timeswrote that "Banderas... does an unexpectedly splendid job as the film's conspiratorial singing narrator."[20]For his performance, he was nominated for theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.[21]He also had success with his role as the masked swordsmanZorroin the 1998 filmThe Mask of Zorro,starringAnthony HopkinsandCatherine Zeta-Jones.Roger Ebertpraised the onscreen chemistry between the two leads, writing, "The best scenes in the movie are between Banderas and Zeta-Jones, who share chemistry and, it turns out, a sense of justice."[22]His performance earned him anotherGolden Globe Awardnomination.[23]In 1999, he starred in the historical action filmThe 13th Warrior, a movie about aMuslimcaught up in a war between theNorthmanand human-eating beasts.[24]

He portrayed Gregorio Cortez, a retired OSS agent, alongsideCarla Gugino, who played his wife, Ingrid Cortez.Roger Ebertpraised the first film, describing it as "giddy with the joy of its invention. It's an exuberant, colorful extravaganza, wall-to-wall with wildly original sets and visual gimmicks, and smart enough to escape the kids film category and play in the mainstream."[25]He also starred inMichael Cristofer'sOriginal SinalongsideAngelina Joliethe same year.
In 2002, he portrayedsocial realistpainterDavid Alfaro SiqueirosinJulie Taymor's biographical dramaFrida,withSalma HayekplayingFrida Kahlo.[26]That same year, he starred inBrian De Palma'serotic thrillerFemme FataleoppositeRebecca Romijn, and in 2003, he starred in the last installment of the trilogyOnce Upon a Time in Mexico(in which he appeared withJohnny Deppand Hayek).

The film was directed byBruce Beresfordand written byLarry Gelbart.[32]Phil Gallo ofVarietywrote, "Villa was larger than life, and Banderas vibrantly captures his bravado. Everything in the telepic, though, is designed to make Villa a likable force, which pushes and pulls Banderas in a number of directions, only some of which play well. Eventually, 'Villa' exposes a dark side in the man, and Banderas forsakes crafting the image of a hero to allow the man’s ambiguity to shine."[33]Banderas was nominated for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movieand theGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Filmfor his performance.[34]

Banderas once described himself as anagnosticin an interview withPeoplemagazine in 2006: "I have to recognize that I am agnostic. I don’t believe in any kind of fundamentalism. I prefer to take life in a different way, with a sense of humor. I try to teach my kids to be open. Whatever they believe is fine with me."[70]He does describe himself close toCatholicspirituality, especially toHoly Week, which he considers a "metaphor for life".[71]He is an officer (mayordomo de trono) of a religious brotherhood in his hometown ofMálagaand travels during Holy Week to take part in theprocessions.[72]Banderas developed his relationship with Catholicism back in 1994 after a spiritual search.[73][74]
"There was a moment in my life in which I separated a bit from the Church. I was searching for a spiritual connection in other places, until in 1994, after my brother had a surgery we were very afraid of, in which we could lose him, I realized I should have not searched for so much, that I had had always that connection with the trascendental in front of my face. It also happened in a way which followed our own traditions, which we shouldn't look for inthe Buddha, as these characters were right there. In my own neighborhood was that way to connect myself to the trascendental through thePassion of the Christ, until concluding inResurrection."
In 2021, he described his religious beliefs and vision of the Holy Week toEl País:[75]
"I live comfortably in the mystery, I'm very doubting, I don't know if agnostic is exactly the word. But I think yes, there is something, although we don't know what is it. TheBig Bang, yes, and before the Big Bang, what? Holy Week has many colors, it's a very strange poliedrum. It is related to faith, popular religion and Andalusian idiosyncrasy. It's just the RomanIdes of March: winter dies and spring is born. The Andalusian version is so colourful and merry because everybody knows the guy will resurrect on Sunday. And there is a happy ending."
Banderas marriedAna Leza[es]in 1987 and divorced her in 1996. He met and began a relationship with American actressMelanie Griffithin 1995 while shootingTwo Much.[6][76]They married on May 14, 1996, in London.

In 2009, Banderas underwent surgery for a benign tumor in his back.[84]Speaking at theMálaga Film Festivalin March 2017, Banderas revealed he had suffered a heart attack on January 26, 2017, but said it "wasn't serious and hasn't caused any damages." Following that incident, he underwent heart surgery to insert three stents into his arteries.[85]In aFresh Airinterview in September 2019, he recalled it as being life-changing. He said, "It just gave me a perspective of who I was, and it just made the important things [go to] the surface. When I say this, people may just think that I'm crazy, but it's one of the best things that ever happened in my life."[86]
He has invested some of his film earnings inAndalusianproducts, which he promotes in Spain and the US. He owns 50% of a winery inVillalba de Duero, Burgos, Spain, called Anta Banderas, which produces red and rosé wines.[87]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
