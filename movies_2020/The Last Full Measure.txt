The Last Full Measureis a 2019 Americanwardramafilm written and directed byTodd Robinson. It follows the efforts of fictional Pentagon staffer Scott Huffman and many veterans to see theMedal of Honorawarded toWilliam H. Pitsenbarger, aUnited States Air ForcePararescuemanwho flew in helicopter rescue missions during theVietnam Warto aid downed soldiers and pilots.[3][4]Based on true events, the film starsSebastian Stan,Christopher Plummer,William Hurt,Ed Harris,Samuel L. Jackson,Jeremy Irvine, andPeter Fonda. It was the final film appearance of Fonda, who died before the film’s release; and Plummer's final on screen appearance before his death in 2021, though it had filmed prior toKnives Out, which was released before it.
Production began in the United States in March 2017, and it premiered in October 2019 inWesthampton Beach, New York.[5]It was released in the U.S. byRoadside Attractionson January 24, 2020, and grossed $3 million against a $20 million budget. Its title is fromAbraham Lincoln'sGettysburg Address, where Lincoln honored the fallen, saying that they "gave the last full measure of devotion."[6]
The Last Full Measurecenters on the true story ofVietnam WarheroWilliam H. Pitsenbarger, aU.S. Air ForcePararescuemanwho personally saved over 60 men during theVietnam War. During a rescue mission on April 11, 1966, Pits, as he was called, chose to leave the relative safety of his rescue helicopter to aid wounded soldiers under heavy fire, when others on his team declined to go. After saving many, he was ordered to leave on the last helicopter out of what became one of the war's bloodiest battles. He chose to stay, sacrificing his own life to save and defend soldiers of theU.S. Army's1st Infantry Division.
32 years later, Pentagon staffer Scott Huffman, on a career fast track, is reluctantly tasked with investigating a posthumousMedal of Honorrequest for Pitsenbarger by his parents and Tom Tulley, Pitsenbarger's partner on the fateful mission. Huffman seeks out the testimony of Army veterans who witnessed or were saved by Pitsenbarger's extraordinary valor, including Takoda, Burr and Mott, who carry their own demons from their experiences.
As Huffman learns more about Pitsenbarger's selfless courage, he uncovers a decades-long, high-level conspiracy: as of Pitsenbarger's death in combat in 1966, the Air Force had never put forth the names ofenlisted personnelto receive the Medal of Honor.[a]This prompts him to put his own career on the line, potentially creating controversy around the company's former commanding officer who ordered the highly dangerous mission, and who is now a US senator seeking reelection.
When a Senate effort to award the medal fails on the floor of Congress due to unrelated political infighting, Huffman goes public with the story, and ultimately the Medal of Honor is awarded to Pitsenbarger by presidential decree. Before the award ceremony, Mott finds the courage to deliver Pitsenbarger's last letter to the airman's former love. Pitsenbarger's father, who is dying of cancer, and mother are in attendance as their son's duty, courage and sacrifice is recounted. The Air Force Secretary presents the medal to the parents, then recognizes everyone in attendance, all of whose lives were influenced by Pitsenbarger's actions, saying, "This is the power of what one person can do." The epilogue points out that as of 2019[update], of the 3,489 Medal of Honor recipients among millions of US military personnel, only three airmen have been enlisted Air Force.
It took nearly 20 years to make the movie. Todd Robinson first learned about theWilliam H. Pitsenbargerstory while researching another movie in 1999. The character of Scott Huffman is loosely based on Parker Hayes, who worked at the Airman Memorial Museum and pushed for Pitsenbarger's commendation be upgraded to the Medal of Honor.[7]The story intrigued him for several reasons, including Pitsenbarger's awarding of theAir Force Crossrather than theMedal of Honor. After he and executive producer Sidney Sherman unsuccessfully pitched the film to more than 50 production companies, Robinson decided to write the script without funding or a studio commitment.[8]
After finishing the script, Robinson and Sherman continued searching for a studio. They landed a deal withNew Line Cinemain 2007, but not long after, New Line was sold toWarner Bros.and the project was canceled and was again without a backer. Robinson and Sherman spent the next decade finding funding, and production finally began in 2017.[8]
It was announced in May 2016 thatScott EastwoodandEd Harrishad been cast, withLaurence FishburneandMorgan Freemanin negotiations.[9]By March 2017, Eastwood was no longer involved, andSamuel L. Jackson,Sebastian Stan,Christopher Plummer,William Hurt,Bradley Whitford,Michael Imperioli,Linus Roache,John SavageandDiane Laddjoined the cast. Filming was to begin betweenAtlantaandCosta Ricalater that month.[10]Grant GustinandLisaGay Hamiltonwere cast as production commenced, withAmy MadiganandPeter Fondajoining in April.[11][12][13]The film was later dedicated  to Fonda's memory.[14]

He gives us evil so pure - and so bottomless - that it can induce tears. Our tears are not for the dastardly Iago, of course - that would be wrong. No, what Mr. Plummer does is make us weep for a civilization that can produce such a man and allow him to flower."[64]For his performance he received aTony Award for Best Actor in a Playnomination losing toRoger ReesinThe Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.[65]

As it happens, Plummer emerges triumphant, while Robards seems utterly at sea...Plummer plays the humour and the bathos with equal ease and complete conviction. By turns funny and heartbreaking, it's an exquisite, haunting performance."[71]For his performance Plummer received his fourthTony Awardnomination.[72]

Peter Henry Fonda(February 23, 1940 – August 16, 2019) was an American actor, film director, and screenwriter. He was a two-timeAcademy Awardnominee, both for acting and screenwriting, and a two-timeGolden Globe Awardwinner for his acting. He was a member of the Fonda acting family, as the son of actorHenry Fonda, the brother of actress and activistJane Fonda, and the father of actressBridget Fonda.
Fonda began his career on stage, winning aNew York Drama Critics' Circle Awardand theTheatre World Awardfor his performance in the playBlood, Sweat and Stanley Poole. He became a prominent figure in thecounterculture of the 1960s,[1][2]starring in and co-writing the filmEasy Rider(1969), which earned him an Oscar nomination forBest Original Screenplay. He then made his directorial debut with theRevisionist WesternfilmThe Hired Hand(1971), in which he also starred. During the following decade, he established himself as anaction star, appearing in a variety of productions includingDirty Mary, Crazy Larry(1974) andFutureworld(1976).
Fonda achieved a major critical comeback with his starring role in the drama filmUlee's Gold(1997), receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Actor and aGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. He also won theGolden Globe for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television FilmforThe Passion of Ayn Rand(1999). In 2003, Fonda received a star on theHollywood Walk of Fameat 7018 Hollywood Blvd, for his contributions to the film industry.[3]
Fonda was born bycaesarean sectionon February 23, 1940, atLeRoy Hospitalin New York City, the only son of actorHenry Fondaand socialiteFrances Ford Seymour; his older sister is actressJane Fonda.[4][5]He and Jane had a half-sister, Frances de Villers Brokaw (1931–2008), from their mother's first marriage. Their mother committed suicide in a mental hospital when Peter, her youngest, was ten. He did not discover the circumstances or location of her death until he was fifteen.
One month prior to his eleventh birthday, he accidentally shot himself in the abdomen and nearly died. He went to the hill station ofNainital, India, and stayed for a few months for recovery.[6]Years later,  while takingLSD[7]withJohn LennonandGeorge Harrison, he referred to this incident, saying, "I know what it's like to be dead." This inspiredThe Beatles' song "She Said She Said".[8]
Peter attended the Fay School inSouthborough, Massachusetts, and was a member of the Class of 1954. He then matriculated inWestminster School, aConnecticutboarding school inSimsbury, where he graduated in 1958.[9]
Once he graduated, Fonda studied acting inOmaha, Nebraska, his father's hometown. While attending theUniversity of Nebraska-Omaha, Fonda joined theOmaha Community Playhouse.
Upon his return to New York, Fonda joined the Cecilwood Theatre in 1960.[10]Afterwards, he found work onBroadwayand gained notice inBlood, Sweat and Stanley Poole, written byJamesandWilliam Goldman, which ran for 84 performances in 1961. Fonda began guest starring on television shows likeNaked City,The New Breed,Wagon Train, andThe Defenders.
Fonda's first film came when producerRoss Hunterwas looking for a new male actor to romanceSandra DeeinTammy and the Doctor(1963). He was cast in the role, in what was a minor hit.[11]He followed this with a support part inThe Victors(1963), a bleak look at American soldiers in World War II, directed byCarl Foreman.[12]Fonda's performance won him a Golden Globe Award for most promising newcomer.
Fonda continued to work in television, guest starring inChanning,Arrest and Trial,The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, and12 O'Clock High. He also tested for the role ofJohn F. KennedyinPT-109.[13]Fonda impressedRobert Rossenwho cast him in what would be Rossen's last movie,Lilith(1964), alongsideWarren Beatty,Jean SebergandGene Hackman. Fonda's performance was well reviewed. Shortly before dying, Rossen signed him to a seven-film contract which was to start with an adaptation ofBang the Drum Slowly.[14]Fonda graduated to a starring role inThe Young Lovers(1964), about out-of-wedlock pregnancy, the sole directorial effort ofSamuel Goldwyn Jr.
By the mid-1960s, Fonda was not a conventional "leading man" in Hollywood. AsPlayboymagazine reported, Fonda had established a "solid reputation as a dropout". He had become outwardly nonconformist and grew his hair long and took LSD regularly, alienating the "establishment" film industry. Desirable acting work became scarce.[15]Through his friendships with members of the bandThe Byrds, Fonda visitedThe Beatlesin their rented house inBenedict Canyonin Los Angeles in August 1965. WhileJohn Lennon,Ringo Starr,George Harrison, and Fonda were under the influence ofLSD, Lennon heard Fonda say, "I know what it's like to be dead." Lennon used the phrase in the lyrics for his song, "She Said She Said", which was included on their 1966 album,Revolver.[8]
In August 1966 Fonda was charged with possession of marijuana,[16]and was later acquitted in December of that year.[17]In November 1966 Fonda was arrested in theSunset Strip riot, which the police ended forcefully. The bandBuffalo Springfieldprotested the department's handling of the incident in their song "For What It's Worth". In 1967, Fonda recorded "November Night", a45-rpm singlewritten byGram Parsonsfor the Chisa label, backed with "Catch the Wind" byDonovan, produced byHugh Masekela.[18]
Fonda's first counterculture-oriented film role was as a biker inRoger Corman'sB movieThe Wild Angels(1966). Fonda originally was to supportGeorge Chakiris, but graduated to the lead when Chakiris revealed he could not ride a motorcycle. In the film, Fonda delivered a "eulogy" at a fallen Angel's funeral service. The movie was a big hit at the box office, screened at theVenice Film Festival, launched the biker movie genre, and established Peter Fonda as a movie name. Fonda made a television pilot,High Noon: The Clock Strikes Noon Again, filmed in December 1965. It was based on the filmHigh Noon(1952), starringGary Cooper, with Fonda in the Cooper role. It did not become a series.[19]
Fonda next played the male lead in Corman's filmThe Trip(1967), a take on the experience and "consequences" of consuming LSD, which was written byJack Nicholson. His co-stars includedSusan Strasberg,Bruce Dern, andDennis Hopper. The movie was a hit.[20]Fonda then traveled to France to appear in theportmanteauhorror movieSpirits of the Dead(1968). His segment co-starred his sister Jane and was directed by her then-husbandRoger Vadim. For American television, he appeared in a movie,Certain Honorable Men(1968), alongsideVan Heflin, written byRod Serling.[21]
Fonda produced, co-wrote and starred inEasy Rider(1969), directed byDennis Hopper.Easy Rideris about two long-haired bikers traveling through thesouthwesternand southern United States where they encounter intolerance and violence. Fonda played "Wyatt",[23]a charismatic, laconic man whose motorcycle jacket bore a largeAmerican flagacross the back.Dennis Hopperplayed the garrulous "Billy".Jack Nicholsonplayed George Hanson, an alcoholiccivil rightslawyer who rides along with them. Fonda co-wrote the screenplay withTerry Southernand Hopper.
Fonda tried to secure financing from Roger Corman andAmerican International Pictures(AIP), with whom he had madeThe Wild AngelsandThe Trip, but they were reluctant to finance a film directed by Hopper. They succeeded in getting money fromColumbia Pictures. Hopper filmed the cross-country road trip depicted almost entirely on location. Fonda had secured funding of around $360,000, largely based on the fact he knew that it was the budgetRoger Cormanneeded to makeThe Wild Angels.[24]The guitarist and composerRobbie Robertson, ofThe Band, was so moved by an advance screening that he approached Fonda and tried to convince him to let him write a complete score, even though the film was nearly due for wide release. Fonda declined the offer, instead usingSteppenwolf's "Born to Be Wild",Bob Dylan's "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" sung byThe Byrds'Roger McGuinn, and Robertson's own composition "The Weight", performed byThe Band, among many other tracks.
The film was released to international success. Jack Nicholson was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Fonda, Hopper and Southern were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The film grossed over $40 million.[citation needed]
After the success ofEasy Rider, both Hopper and Fonda were sought for film projects. Hopper directed the filmThe Last Movie(1971), in which Fonda co-starred along with singerMichelle PhillipsofThe Mamas and the Papas.[25]Fonda directed and starred in theWesternfilmThe Hired Hand(1971). He took the lead role in a cast that also featuredWarren Oates,Verna BloomandBeat GenerationpoetMichael McClure. The film received mixed reviews and failed commercially upon its initial release, but many years later, in 2001, a fully restored version was shown at various film festivals and was re-released by theSundance Channelon DVD that same year in two separate editions. Fonda later directed the science fiction filmIdaho Transfer(1973). He did not appear in the film, and the film received mixed reviews upon its limited release. Around the same time, he co-starred withLindsay WagnerinTwo People(also 1973) for directorRobert Wise, in which he portrayed aVietnam Wardeserter.
Fonda starred alongsideSusan Georgeand longtime-friend (and frequent co-star)Adam Roarkein the filmDirty Mary, Crazy Larry(1974), a film about twoNASCARhopefuls who execute a supermarket heist to finance their jump into big-time auto racing. The film was a box-office hit that year. It led to Fonda's making a series of action movies:Open Season(1974), withWilliam Holden;Race with the Devil(1975), fleeing devil worshippers with Warren Oates (another hit);[26]92 in the Shade(1975), again with Oates, for writer-directorThomas McGuane;Killer Force(1976) for directorVal Guest;Futureworld(1976), a sequel toWestworld(1973), financed by AIP;[27]Fighting Mad(1976), a reuniting with Roger Corman, directed byJonathan Demme.[28]
Outlaw Blues(1977) was a drama, with Fonda playing a musician oppositeSusan Saint James. After some more action withHigh-Ballin'(1978), Fonda returned to directing, with the controversial dramaWanda Nevada(1979), wherein the 39-year-old Fonda starred as the "love" interest of the then 13-year-oldBrooke Shields. His father,Henry Fonda, made a brief appearance as well, and it is the only film in which they performed together.[29]
Fonda was top billed inThe Hostage Tower(1980), a television movie based on a story byAlistair MacLean. Fonda appeared in the hit filmThe Cannonball Run(1981) as the "chief biker", a tongue-in-cheek nod to his earlier motorcycle films. He also played a charismatic cult leader inSplit Image(1982), a film that also starredJames Woods,Karen AllenandBrian Dennehy. Despite the strong cast and positive reviews, the film failed to find an audience.

I ride anMV Agusta. This is an Italian racing motorcycle. It forces focus. You have to be focused and in my life, in this business, focus is hard to find sometimes. So I need to force focus and that's great. The bike takes you on a free road. There's no fences on the roads I ride and I don't ride freeways. That's as much as I can tell you, because there are more lands waiting for this little Christian boy. That's not true. I'm an atheist, but what the heck.[37]

The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms).

Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
