Like a Bossis a 2020 Americancomedy filmdirected byMiguel Arteta, written by Sam Pitman and Adam Cole-Kelly, and starringTiffany Haddish,Rose Byrne, andSalma Hayek.
The plot follows two lifelong friends who fight to take back control of their cosmetics company from an industry titan.
The film was theatrically released in the United States on January 10, 2020, byParamount Pictures. It received negative reviews from critics, though the cast received praise.
Lifelong best friends Mia and Mel, who have very different personalities, share a house and run their own beauty company, Mia&Mel. The first is more  creative, while Mel is the organised one who keeps the books and tries to keep everything running smoothly, while keeping secret their massive debt.
Going together to an old classmate's baby shower, the pair are awestruck by everyone else's wealth. As most everyone there are starting families and having babies, the pair are asked when they are going to join in, they say the company is their baby. Frustrated after a woman brags about her daughter's particularly lucrative business deal, Mia and Mel sneak off to smoke a joint, inadvertantly exposing an infant to the smoke.
Mia has a casual, purely physical regular hookup with a much younger man. Mel, on the other hand, has a hookup she turns away as soon as he gets up. On their way to work, Mel contemplates their continued single lifestyles, wondering if they should be concerned, which Mia brushes aside.
When Claire Luna, Head of major cosmetics empire Oviedo, contacts Mia&Mel after seeing their 'One Night Stand', single use makeup kit to invest in them, Mia is not interested. However, Mel reveals they are in debt almost half a million dollars, so they meet. Mia is suspicious of Claire's motives, and rightly so, as she intends tosteal the businessout from under them.
The two must address their differences to save their business, as they are faced with the challenge of proving themselves to Luna even as she steals their 'one-night-stand' bag idea and has it marketed through one of her other companies, as well as forcing them to fire one of their workers, Barrett, leaving fellow staffer Sydney as their sole employee.
Mia and Mel briefly 'split up' through their different approaches to Luna's offer, but they reconcile when their friends help them face how they need each other. Faced with the possible loss of their business, Mia and Mel approach Shay, Luna's former business partner, to start a new company, Proud Cosmetics, marketing their new 'Ride or Die' product, make-up intended to be used by best friends together to face their nights out.
With thisloophole, Mia and Mel can produce and market 'Ride or Die' under the 'Proud' banner while Luna takes ownership of Mia&Mel while still being required to pay them 49% of all subsequent earnings. Mia and Mel also bring along Sydney and Barrett to the new company.

"You gravitate to where you want to go, but so much is out of your control", she remarked. After the success ofDamages, she asked her agents to send her out for comedies. "I was doing all of this really heavy, dramatic stuff, and I just needed a break,” she said.[17]Her request was met when she obtained the role of a scandalous pop star and the on-and-off girlfriend of a free-spirited rock star in the comedyGet Him to the Greek(2010), also starringRussell BrandandJonah Hill. DirectorNicholas Stolleradmitted that, in her audition, he thought: "'Why is she here?' Because, you know, very good actress, but very serious".

And that was that".[17]The film was a commercial success, with a gross of US$60.9 million in North America.[30]
2011 was a turning point in Byrne's career, when she appeared in three high-profile theatrical films, leading to a trajectory that included three to four films per year.

A critically panned but commercially successful remake of the 1982 classic,Annie,[57]was released in December 2014 and featured Byrne playing the role of Grace Farrell, the titular character's mother figure and Mr. Stacks' faithful personal assistant.

The film was an arthouse success, withRotten Tomatoes' critical consensus reading: "Juliet, Naked's somewhat familiar narrative arc is elevated by standout work from a charming cast led by a well-matched Rose Byrne and Ethan Hawke."[57]I Am Mother(2019) is a thriller and sci-fi movie withClara Rugaardand Oscar winnerHilary Swank.

Since the beginning of her career, her performances have been acclaimed by critics.[65][66][67]In 2018, Byrne was noted for her comedic work.[68]She consciously made the transition to less dramatic material in the late 2000s, finding the idea of being "boxed in" to be "insufferable".[17]"You have to be aggressive in this business,” she noted. "You have always got to push for what you want. Working with Glenn [Close, onDamages], she was the hardest worker ever. She was constantly pushing".[17]Her turn to comedy led toThe Hollywood Reportercalling her "the most in-demand supporting actress for comedies".[69]Deciderwrote a story titled "How Did Rose Byrne Become One of Our Best Comedic Actresses?", in which it was remarked: "Byrne's emergence as one of the brightest stars in theApatowverseis all the more remarkable for her lack of a comedy background. [...] Any doubts about Byrne's massive comedic talent—and afterBridesmaidsandNeighbors, you'd have to be pretty stubborn to still have doubts—were put to rest with 2015'sSpy, where she again steals the show as merciless terrorist Rayna. Byrne and McCarthy's private-plane banter is the highlight of the film and could have gone on another 30 minutes as far as I'm concerned".[70]
In 2013, Byrne lived in New York and said she remained insecure about a stable career: "I don't think that insecurity ever leaves you. You're a freelancer. There's always an element of uncertainty."[4]Byrne has supportedUNICEFAustralia as the face of the 2007 Designers United campaign, and was a jury member ofTropfestin 2006 and Tropfest@Tribeca[71]in 2007.

It's about access. It's about opportunity. It's about knowledge. I lived a 12-minute drive from Carnegie Mellon University for my entire life and had no idea that it was one of the best drama schools in the world. How did I not know that? This is what we mean when we say it's not equal—it's not a level playing field. Had [my teacher] not said something, I would have moved to New York City unprepared and tanked. It was because of teachers, the angels in my life who saw me before I could even see myself, and said, "You're going over here. Just listen." And I knew enough to actually shut up and listen.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
