It starsNikolaj Coster-Waldau,Annabelle Wallis,Hero Fiennes Tiffin,Zahn McClarnon, andMelanie Scrofano. The film is about a hunter and a sheriff who track down a murderer who may have kidnapped the hunter's daughter years before.
It was released throughDirecTV Cinemaon July 16, 2020, and in theaters andVODon August 14, 2020, bySaban Films.
AlcoholicRayburn Swanson is the owner of the Gwen SwansonSanctuaryin northern Minnesota, named after his missing daughter. The sanctuary is an act ofpenance, both because Gwen disapproved of his trapper lifestyle and because she had disappeared from his car five years earlier while he went into a store to buy whiskey. Rayburn keeps hunters out by using surveillance cameras.
Sheriff Alice Gustafson is the sister of a troubled young man, Brooks. While examining the body of a young girl found by a lake, Alice notices a scar on the girl's throat, along with the point of a spearhead (marked with an “MB”) buried in a tree. After learning about the body, Rayburn arrives to make a positive ID, but it is not Gwen. Alice learns that the spear was used with a rare weapon known as anatlatl.
Rayburn sees a man in aghillie suitstalking the woods; when Rayburn attempts to confront the man, he is wounded by a thrown spear. While fleeing, he comes across a black pickup truck with the license plates removed. He marks the truck by scratching a small 'x' on the fender. After returning home and stitching his wound, he reviews his surveillance footage and observes a girl being hunted in the sanctuary by the same man. Rayburn returns to the sanctuary and rescues the girl, Molly, then keeps her safe in an unusedspike trapovernight. She was rendered mute, having a throat scar similar to the one on the dead girl. They make it back to the cabin the next evening but are ambushed by the hunter. The hunter injures Rayburn and stabs Molly with a spear. Alice arrives and, after seeing that Molly has been stabbed, immediately suspects Rayburn, until the hunter appears behind her. Still disguised, his mannerisms cause her to believe it is her brother. Alice shoots Rayburn, wounding him, and causing him to flee so that her brother can escape.
Alice searches for Rayburn and steps on a bear trap he had set, injuring her ankle. He escapes in her patrol car and calls an ambulance for Molly; Alice calls for Rayburn's arrest. He flees to the home of his former wife, Debbie, and her husband, Karl Blackhawk, Sheriff of the local Indian tribal police. They take him to the "Factory", an abandoned mill where the homeless stay, and call Dr. Jon Boone to treat him. Brooks coincidentally arrives and is arrested by Karl, although he has an alibi to establish his innocence. Alice, realizing her moral failure, promises Molly, now hospitalized, that she will catch the killer. She also noticed the same throat scar on Molly.
Rayburn decides to clean up and throw out his liquor, except for the still unopened bottle he bought on the day Gwen had gone missing. He remembers the marked truck and locates it. After breaking into a house, he finds the same weapons and clothes worn by the killer, along with a trove of "missing" posters, including one for his daughter. After finding a still-living girl under a sheet with her throat surgically cut open, the killer appears and captures Rayburn by knocking him unconscious.
Alice notices issues with the autopsy report by Dr. Boone. While waiting for him in his office, she sees a photo of the doctor with his daughter Melissa wearing a necklace with the initials "MB". Alice realizes that Boone is the killer and immediately calls for backup to raid Boone's home; the same home Rayburn had found.
Boone explains to Rayburn that while grieving his own daughter, who had been killed by adrunk driver, he began kidnapping and killing teen girls to "save" them from bad parents, including Rayburn; he operates on thelarynxso they cannot call for help while being hunted. Boone takes Rayburn to the wildlife sanctuary and forces him to flee so that he can be hunted. Alice sees Rayburn on the surveillance. Rayburn overpowers Boone and beats him severely as Alice arrives; she attempts to stop Rayburn, but he ignores her and throws Boone into one of the spike traps, mortally wounding him. Alice looks on as Rayburn closes the doctor in, telling her that they are even (he had lied earlier, saying the intruder shot him instead of Alice). She later sits in a patrol car, listening to the radio about the ongoingmanhuntfor Dr. Boone.
Rayburn and his ex-wife have a funeral for Gwen, which Molly attends, providing him closure. He then empties his last bottle of whisky into the lake in memory of his daughter.

As of February 2020[update], DirecTV manages a fleet of 12 satellites ingeostationary orbitat positions ranging from95°Wto119°W, ensuring strong coverage of the North American continent.
DirecTV's initial service offering was characterized by the delivery of all-digital standard definition national channels to locations in the lower 48 states. This allowed households without available cable television service to receive national channels. In these early years, receivers were manufactured with brands including RCA and GE (Thomsonof France) andSony Electronics.[103]When DirecTV launched a few High Definition channels in the late 1990s, other CE manufacturers joined in with HD capable receivers under their own brands which helped promote sales of their early generation HD television products. These additional company brands includedSamsung Electronics,Philips,Panasonic,Mitsubishi Electronics, andToshiba.[103]Features that were innovative at the time included: a fully interactive program guide, parental controls (i.e. allowed parents to passcode protect channels having R-rated content), and pay-per-view (allowing rentals via remote control instead of having to call DirecTV for authorization). The initial generation of antennas was 18-inch diameter (46 cm) with a single feed (consisting of a feedhorn and LNB electronics) that could downlink digital television signals from DirecTV's satellites at the 101 degrees West geostationary orbital position.[104]
DirecTV receiver modifications accommodated local channels, including multi-orbital slot reception and an improved electronic program guide featuring TV listings up to two weeks. The first locals-era DirecTV outdoor antenna was a follow-up generation with a 18x24-inch diameter (46x61 cm) elliptical reflector and three feeds that additionally allowed “multi-sat” reception from DIRECTV satellites at the 119W and 110W positions.
DirecTV launched new network components dedicated to HD channels. The new network components allowed DirecTV to address challenges with customers experiencing different user interfaces depending on the brand of DirecTV receiver they used, by specifying a “common user experience.” DirecTV's designs were built with companies includingPace Micro Technologyof Britain,LGof South Korea (which had manufactured boxes under the LG andZenith Electronicsnames), Thomson, GE (under license), andProScan.[103]
DirecTV's initial satellites used Ku band frequencies. With the launch of new satellites utilizingKu bandfrequencies, DirecTV increased its available signal bandwidth more than six-fold to meet the requirements of the higher resolution HD television pictures. DirecTV also maintained its original fleet of satellites in operation at 101W, 110W and 119W longitudes and simulcasted the SD and HD versions of channels once made available. These new DirecTV HD channels required an H20/HR20 or later model set top box capable of supporting the MPEG-4 standard for HD programming. These models also introduced HDMI support for HDTVs with an HDMI port. 
A new “Slimline” outdoor antenna design was introduced, capable of receiving both the Ka Band satellites located at 99W and 103W longitude as well for a total of 5 LNBs. Over time, DirecTV has consolidated HD programming onto solely the 99W, 101W and 103W slots allowing for the use of a Slimline antenna having 3 LNBs instead of 5.
Video On-Demand (VOD) features were enabled, allowing a viewer to “start over” a program, “look back” at a program that had recently aired, watch prior episodes that weren't presently aired, and see advertising according to that viewer's characteristics. “Whole-home” viewing allowed viewers to access and view their DVR recordings from any room in the house, not just the room where the DVR receiver was located.
In 2012, DirecTV launched its “Genie” family of receiver models, consisting of a “Genie” home server and “mini Genie” devices. Having 5 satellite tuners, the Genie offered live viewing of up to four channels while simultaneously recording a program on a fifth channel. Up to eight mini-Genies could be installed in a home, however simultaneous live viewing was possible on any four of the devices (including the Genie itself).[105][106]
In addition, DirecTV integrated WiFi wireless home networking to connect set-top boxes to broadband services. DirecTV incorporated RVU remote user interface technology, allowing a single DirecTV receiver to transmit both video/audio and user screen direction to compatible television sets.[107]DirecTV also developed capabilities to “download and go” DVR recordings (“GenieGo”) and to stream recordings to devices while out of home.
DirecTV introduced limited 4K UltraHD and High Dynamic Range broadcasts. The first nationwide 4K UltraHD broadcasts were made available by DirecTV, and DirecTV offered large sporting events in the format as well as PPV movie rentals and 4K channels. The 4K capable DirecTV miniGenie client (model C61K-700) also became available.[107]
A “Genie 2” device, HS17, was introduced in 2017 that added more satellite tuners and integrated the WVB functionality.[108]
DirecTV began delivering broadband-only services requiring no DirecTV branded equipment whatsoever. Under its new owner AT&T, mobile-device-only television packages were developed (i.e. WatchTV). The DirecTV Stream device (model C71KW) became available in 2019 to customers of over-the-top (OTT) streaming service.[109]
In 2023, DirecTV released Gemini, a set-top box based onAndroid TVhardware that succeeds the DirecTV Stream box; it is distributed in two versions, with one relying solely on OTT services, and a second designed to also function as a client for the Genie system. It is designed to aggregate live TV and OTT content in a singular interface.[110]
DirecTV transmits programming withencryptionto mitigatesignal piracy. The receiver (also known as an IRD, or "integrated receiver-decoder") utilizesISO/IEC 7816smart cardswhich tell the receiver how to decrypt the programming for viewing. In a continuing effort to combat piracy, an access card generation is created approximately every two years, superseding the old set. DirecTV is now utilizing the fifth generation of access cards.
DirecTV has battled with an active signal piracy underground for many years. One infamous event that temporarily hampered pirates was known as 'Black Sunday', which took place one week before Super Bowl Sunday in 2001. Hackers saw a string of software updates starting in late 2000 which each contained a few innocuous bytes. However, when the innocuous bytes from all those updates were combined, they became code that searched for and destroyed 98% of hacked smart cards and then wrote the text "GAME OVER" to the first 8 bytes of the hacked cards memory. Hacks continued after that event.[111][112][113][114]
Like its competitors, DirecTV offershigh-definition television(HDTV) and interactive services.
To handle the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive HDTV broadcasting, DirecTV rebroadcasts local HDTV stations using theH.264/MPEG-4 AVCcodecwhile employing a newer transmission protocol (DVB-S2) over the newer satellites. This allows the service to transmit high-definition television faster over satellite signal than was previously feasible using the olderMPEG-2compression andDSSprotocol.
Receiving channels encoded in MPEG-4 requires newer receivers, such as the H20 as well as the 5-LNB Ka/Kudish. Contracts such asPace Micro Technology,LG ElectronicsandThomsonhave manufactured MPEG-4 receivers for the company. Pace developed the DirecTV Plus HD DVR (Model HR20-700, and HR21-700),LG Electronicsthe Model H20-600 receiver, and Thomson the Model H20-100 and HR20-100 DVR receivers.
DirecTV has admitted to software issues with some of the H20 receivers and HR20 DVRs, which have been plagued with problems since they were released in mid-2006.
In November 2014, DirecTV became the first television provider to begin offering4Kultra-high definitioncontent. On launch, 4K content was limited to renting a small library of on-demand films, downloaded to the subscriber's Genie DVR (some 4K content can also be pre-loaded automatically to the set-top box via the Genie Recommends feature). The 4K service could also only be used on "DirecTV 4K Ready" televisions, which supportRVU protocol; this was limited to selectedSamsung4K televisions released in 2014.[115]
In 2015, DirecTV introduced 4K Genie Mini set-top boxes, which can be connected to anyHDMI2.0/HDCP2.2-compliant devices to provide 4K video.[116]
In April 2016, DirecTV began live sports broadcasts in 4K to eligible subscribers, including coverage from the2016 Masters Tournament,[117][118]25MLB NetworkShowcasebaseball games in the 2016 season (subject to localblackout restrictions) beginning April 15, 2016,[119]and allNotre Dame college footballhome games during the 2016 season.[120]
DirecTV's exclusive general entertainment channelAudience Networkbroadcast dozens of original and acquired programs. The channel ceased operations in 2020. Separately, DirecTV had its own exclusive3DTVchannel,n3D, that launched in 2010 and was shuttered in 2012.

DirecTV previously owned the regional sports networksAT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh,AT&T SportsNet Southwest,AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain, andRoot Sports Northwest(all under the umbrella ofAT&T Sports Networks). It also owned minority shares ofGame Show NetworkandMLB Network. DirecTV was also the exclusive U.S. rights holder to theNFL Sunday Ticket, from the sports package's debut in the1994 NFL seasonto the2022 NFL season, beforeYouTube TVpicked up NFL Sunday Ticket for the2023 NFL season.

DirecTV offers movie and special event programming through theDirecTV Cinemaservice; originally apay-per-viewservice (with programs purchased either over the phone, or via remote if a phone line was connected to the DirecTV receiver), advances in technology have enabled DirecTV to expand the format into avideo on demandservice; access to this service requires an internet connection.
DirecTV has become an alternative for commercial establishments, such as bars, restaurants, and casinos, to show sports games under license by streaming services. This provides a loophole in the streaming providers' terms of service that normally prohibit their use in commercial establishments where the business makes money. In addition, these establishments do not have to reconfigure their systems to accommodate a streaming-only platform.[121]
Beginning in 2021, DirecTV became an exclusive provider ofESPN+ for Business, which carries limited live sporting events that are otherwise streamed on an ESPN+ consumer account. This package is sold directly byJoe Hand Promotions.[122]On August 23, 2022,Amazonand DirecTV entered into a multi-year carriage agreement to broadcastThursday Night Footballonly to business customers at no extra cost.[121]In 2023, DirecTV signed an exclusive deal with Apple TV+ to broadcastMLS Season PassandFriday Night Baseball, which both packages include in-market and out of market teams from each respective league, to its business customers only.[123][124]Later in 2023, it was also announced that DirecTV would retain the rights to NFL Sunday Ticket for business customers only.[125]
Beginning in 2006, DirecTV began a series ofcommercialsin which characters from popular movies and television showsbreak the fourth wallto tout the service's picture quality and the number of channels available in high definition. Instead of usingCGI, the original actors normally reprise their roles on recreated sets, and resulting footage is mixed with the original scenes. The productions are recent and appeal to DirecTV's "male-oriented marketing message."[126]These characters includeCaptain Kirk(William Shatner,Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country), Bill Harding (Bill Paxton,Twister), The Economics Teacher (Ben Stein,Ferris Bueller's Day Off),Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd,Back to the Future),Burton Guster(Dulé Hill,Psych),C.J. Parker(Pamela Anderson,Baywatch), Rick "Wild Thing" Vaughn (Charlie Sheen,Major League),Beyoncé(Upgrade Umusic video), Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth,American Pie),Turtle(Jerry Ferrara,Entourage),Ellen Ripley(Sigourney Weaver,Aliens), Steve Freeling (Craig T. Nelson,Poltergeist),Annie Wilkes(Kathy Bates,Misery),Mini-Me(Verne Troyer,Austin Powers in Goldmember), The Girl in the Ferrari (Christie Brinkley,National Lampoon's Vacation),Daisy Duke(Jessica Simpson,The Dukes of Hazzard),T-1000(Robert Patrick,Terminator 2: Judgment Day), Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts,King Kong),Hellboy(Ron Perlman,Hellboy), Richard Hayden (David Spade,Tommy Boy),The Black Eyed Peas("Meet Me Halfway" music video),Christina Aguilera("Keeps Gettin' Better" music video) and Honey Hornee (Kim Basinger,Wayne's World 2). Also in the series of commercials Don't be like this,Rob LowewerePeyton Manning,Eli Manning,Tony Romo,Andrew Luck,Randy MossandArchie ManningpromotingNFL Sunday Ticket, andDale Earnhardt Jr.promotingNASCAR Hot Pass. Cartoon characters have also been used in the ads, beginning withScooby-Dooand the Mystery, Inc. gang. Recent commercials have also featured modelHannah Davisand a "talking" horse.
DirecTV during that time also ran a series of ads that take shots at cable television's service (or lack of service). Beginning in March 2010, they did a spoof of the classic game showTo Tell The TruthwithAlex Trebekhosting the show. The series of commercials both pays homage to theGoodson-Todmangame show and take shots at both cable and DirecTV's archrivalDish Network, who later sued forfalse advertising. Another series of commercials, promoting the 2010 NFL Sunday Ticket package of all-football programming, featured neighbors committing uncivil acts to neighbors who watched the "wrong" football team. One spot had a woman leaving a snack platter for a neighbor on which the food spelled out "DIRT BAG"; another showed a dog trashing a neighbor's property; yet another showed an on-duty policeman knocking on a DirecTV customer's door, stunning him with a taser and leaving him passed out in his open doorway. In August 2011,Deion Sandersbegan appearing in DirecTV's ads for NFL Sunday Ticket, urging people to switch from cable. These ads originally claimed NFL Sunday Ticket is now "free" for new customers for one year with a subscription to their Premiere package and a two-year contract. In response, on August 4, 2011,Comcastsued DirecTV for false advertising.[127]Comcast dropped the case on August 19, 2011, after DirecTV altered the ads to remove the word "free", changing it to "at no extra charge".[128]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
