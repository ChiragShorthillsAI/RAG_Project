It is based on the 2017 comic book of the same name by Logothetis and McGrath.[1][2][3][4]It starsAlain Moussi,Frank Grillo,JuJu Chan,Tony JaaandNicolas Cage.[5][6][7]It was abox office bomb, grossing less than $100,000 against a budget of $25 million,[8][9]and was critically panned.
Every six years in the last two millennia, an ancient order of superhuman martial artists calledJiu Jitsufaces a vicious race of alien invaders in a battle forEarth. The invaders have always lost to Earth's defenders, up until now.
In a jungle inBurma (Myanmar), American soldier Jake Barnes is running away from alienshuriken. Jake ends up falling off an oceanside cliff, where a mysterious western man rescues him and gives him over to the care of two Burmese fishermen. Assuming that he came from a nearby military post, and after foreboding miscommunication with inexperienced translator, they take him there. Upon regaining consciousness, he is interrogated by an intelligence officer, Myra, as the military is puzzled by the villagers' mention of a comet that comes every six years and a hole in a temple opening. However, Jake appears to haveamnesia, with no recall of events leading to his being found in the water, with eventruth serumsfailing to disclose anything.
While Myra discusses this other operatives, Keung, an advanced Jiu Jitsu fighter, breaks his way through the base to rescue him, besting fist and gun alike. Keung recognizes Jake with a special handclasp and the two escape, in a long sequence that confirms Jake, too, is skilled in superhuman martial arts. They then reunite with a band of Jiu Jitsu fighters led by Harrigan. The fighters seem to know Jake, but he does not remember them or their mission. As they try to leave to head back to their base, the American military turns up again, and although the fighters easily defeat them, Myra manages to recapure Jake. He is interrogated again, but Jake only tells her to leave the zone with her unit, and Myra ultimately agrees. While traveling on foot through the jungle, they are attacked by the leader of the invaders, Brax, who wipes out the soldiers.
While running away, Jake falls into the cave of the mysterious man that rescued him, who turns out to be Wylie, a crazed Jiu Jitsu veteran. With the arrival of the rest of the band, they show Jake the Jiu Jitsu temple, which houses a portal the invaders use to cross into the Earth, and inform him Braz is coming for him. Jake also discovers Jiu Jitsu fighter Carmen used to be his lover before his amnesia. Brax then attacks the group, defeating the band and forcing Jake on his own again. After meeting and being encouraged by one of the American survivors, Cpt. Sand, Jake reunites again with Wylie, who reveals him the truth: Jake was a Jiu Jitsu fighter who fled from Brax during their first encounter, saving his life in exchange for unintentionally allowing the invader to wreak havoc. Wylie admits to be himself an escapee from the previous battle and accepts to help Jake.
The remaining Jiu Jitsu fighters face Brax again, being defeated and killed save for Carmen. Wylie duels Brax to atone for his past mistake, but although he gives a tough fight, he is killed too. After reuniting with him, Carmen reveals Jake that Wylie was his father, which he did not dare to tell him out of shame. Helped by the villagers and surviving soldiers, Jake decides to take on Brax with all of his might. After a long and prolonged battle, capitalizing on a vulnerability to fire he spotted on Brax on their previous fight, he is ultimately victorious, cutting Brax up, shoving a grenade on his innards before he heals up, and kicking him into the portal, finally ending the Jiu Jitsu challenge.

OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 28% based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 3.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "Jiu Jitsupits an ancient order of warriors against an alien invasion -- yet despite that appealingly bizarre premise and a cast that includes Nicolas Cage and Tony Jaa, it's the audience that loses."[18]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted averagescore of 28 out of 100, based on reviews from 11 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[19]
Simon Abrams ofRogerEbert.comawarded the film one and a half stars.[20]John DeFore ofThe Hollywood Reportergave the film a negative review, noting that it "has all the barely-motivated action and sci-fi trappings of a middling videogame and, well, at least a little of the dramatic value."[21]Tambay Obenson ofIndieWiregraded the film a D.[22]Jeffrey M. Anderson ofCommon Sense Mediagave the film two stars out of five.[23]Slant Magazine's Steven Scaife awarded the film one and a half stars out of four.[24]Chris Bumbray ofJoBlo.comgave the film a 5 out of 10.[25]

Darren Murray from Martial Arts Actions Cinema rated the film 3 out of 5.[30]Brent McKnight on Giant Freakin Robot also gave the film a positive rating.[31]
Film School Rejects's Rob Hunter promoted the film positively, noting that, "[...] while it neglects to include any jiu-jitsu... it does give viewers plenty of action beats and a few fun thrills".[32]
Kristy Puchko ofIGNgave it 6 out of 10 and wrote "Jiu Jitsufeels like a deeply 2020 movie in that it is a barrage of WTF choices that hit without mercy until you either give in and go with the flow or just go mad. Or, hey, maybe both." She also questioned some of the film's visual design choices, such as using animated comic book panels and a saturated color scheme.[33]J. Hurtado ofScreen Anarchyreviewed the film negatively, calling it "an Adderall addled mess of a film that attempts to scratch a gonzo action itch that would be better served by hitting up a playlist of stunt demo reels onYouTube."[34]
Jiu Jitsuhad a cumulative worldwide gross of $99,924[9]against a budget of $25 million.[8]
In 2021, Logothetis announced that he would not be returning to Cyprus to shoot the film's planned sequels or his next filmMan of War.[35]He and the film's producers announced their decision to pull out of Cyprus completely, stating their intention to take legal action against the Cypriot government due to the continued non-payment of almost €8 million which the film's investors are owed by the government per the terms of their contract.[35]Jiu Jitsuwas made under the cash rebate scheme launched by the Cyprus Investment Promotion Agency (CIPA).[35]The producers said that a report by Cyprus' auditor general Odysseas Michaelides on the CIPA in general andJiu Jitsuwas completely false, ignorant of how such schemes operate, and potentially defamatory.[35]
One of the film's producers, Chris Economides, called the government "incompetent" and guilty of a "tragic failure" that has resulted in filmmakers becoming "mired in petty local politics".[35]He explained that this will cause producers to go elsewhere, since similar schemes operate all over Europe.[35]He said, "What it means for Logothetis to leave includes the $120 million which he'd agreed to bring to Cyprus to make three other films. It includesMan of Warwhich is [budgeted at] $37 million [and] it includesJiu Jitsu 2which might be another $24 million."[35]He also mentioned his belief that the $600 million Czech investment fund behindJiu Jitsu, which also backed five other films at the same time, would "surely not be coming back here after all that's happened".[35]
Economides said that he did not see auditor general Michaelides as dishonest but merely uninformed, stating, "[Michaelides] only started taking an interest in the sector in 2019, because of the scheme. I've been in this business for 40 years."[35]He especially noted the unfairness of Michaelides wrongly pointing out supposed irregularities without first asking for an explanation, as well as "exceeding his remit to become a film-critic-general" by examining the film's box office and critical reception despite the fact that these are irrelevant to the rebate scheme.[35]The producers also put out a statement showing that the government actually stands to make roughly €960,000 fromJiu Jitsuwhen the rebate money (assuming the film makes money) gets stacked against the direct and indirect taxes it can collect from the film's contribution to the local economy.[35]
Economides also said thatMan of Warwas "all set to go" and that contracts had been signed with local crew who have now lost their jobs, and locations had already been found in theNicosiaarea that would double asCalifornia.[35]The continued non-payment, coupled with the auditor general's report, led to the local bank that was lending money based on the rebate to cancel the deal and state that the scheme did not seem reliable.[35]Logothetis said, "I can no longer make the movie [in Cyprus]. I'm not going to makeMan of Warhere. I'm going to take it somewhere else. [...] If you don't pay on time and you don't treat a producer properly, they're going to leave. And so, you win. Everybody wants to win an argument—fine, you won the argument. We're gonna take our movie, take our money, and we're gonna go somewhere else. Thank you."[35]

When Logothetis was six years old, he moved with his parents to Los Angeles; he attendedBeverly Vista Grammar SchoolandLawndale High School, where he playedfootballand rantrack, before moving on toLoyola Marymount University.
In his last year of university, Logothetis was hired byCapitol Recordsto record the American tour of rock bandThe Knack.[citation needed]He was then hired byColumbia Picturesto produce his first film,Hardbodies 2. In 1987, he directed his first feature filmPretty Smart,[2]and developed the horror filmSlaughterhouse Rock. In 1989, he made a documentary about five heavyweight boxers who dominated the sport in their time,Champions Forever, starringMuhammad AliandJoe Frazier.
Danny Aiellothen came to Logothetis with astage play,Wheel Barrel Closers, which Logothetis adapted for the screen and directed under the titleThe Closer, starring Aiello,Diane BakerandMichael Paré. He then acquired the rights to aStephen Kingscript written specifically for the screen, and producedSleepwalkersfor Columbia Pictures.
In 1994, Logothetis directed and producedBody Shot,[3]afilm noirthriller starringRobert Patrick, for HBO. He then moved into the Western genre and produced and directedCheyenne,[4]starring Bo Svensen andGary Hudson.
In 1999, Logothetis was hired byWarner Brothersand directed the pilot for the television seriesRobin Hood.[5]
He directedMike Hammer,[6]starringStacy Keach, for Franklin Waterman. He then directed the pilot episode for the action adventure seriesAir America, starringLorenzo Lamas, and went on to direct eight more episodes.
In 2000, Logothetis was hired by Warner Brothers to be the executive producer of the science fiction action adventure TV seriesCode Name: Eternity. He was responsible for the creative look and feel of the series and for writing and directing thepilotepisode. The next year, Warner Brothers asked him to serve as executive producer and to direct another TV anthology,The Dark Realm, where he edited the two-hour pilot episode and supervised the screenwriting.
In 2010, Logothetis became President of Production atKings Road Entertainment.[7]He then re-developed and wrote a series calledThe Outfit,[8]again based on Giancana, that he set up with Radar Pictures and producerTed Field. He then set up a remake ofAll of Mewith John Davis andDreamWorks,[9]which he is set to produce. DreamWorks let the option onAll of Meexpire and Logothetis teamed up withTodd Garnerto set upAll of Meas a TV series at NBC Universal.[10]
In 2013, Logothetis took up Giancana again, and along with his project partner Nick Celozzi, wrote, produced and directed a documentary on him,Momo: The Sam Giancana Story, which won the 2012 Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival "Best Feature Documentary" award.[11]In 2015, he producedKickboxer: Vengeance,[12]a reboot of theKickboxerfranchise, with Ted Field and Radar Pictures.
Logothetis wrote and producedKickboxer: Vengeancestarring Jean-Claude Van Damme and the new kickboxer, Alain Moussi, with other talents such as Dave Bautista, Georges Saint-Pierre, and Gina Carano. Logothetis was attracted to the original Jean-Claude Van Damme's Kickboxer because of his martial arts background and that's what inspired him to pursue the rights to the original, develop a reboot of the franchise and ultimately write, produce and direct a contemporary version of the pop culture, iconic Kickboxer. It was important that Logothetis to convince Van Damme to step into the role of mentor to ordain a new, high octane Kickboxer who has a sixth degree black belt in Jiu-Jitsu, Alain Moussi. According to Den of Geek, “ Kickboxer: Vengeance is the nostalgic treat you'd hoped for, the cinematic equivalent of an old, warm, blood stained blanket, that you wrap yourself up in and then hope more people will want to join you under, but most likely won't. There is a strange comfort to watching familiar events unfold from a new perspective, but it's the respectful way it treats the original that makes it such good entertainment for long time Kickboxer fans”.[13]“Kickboxer: Vengeance is a pleasant surprise with a fun twist on the 80s action film but set in modern-day Thailand, and a knowing self-reflexive quality that actually makes it a really enjoyable twist. If you enjoy martial arts, action, a bit of tongue-in-cheek comedy or if you just enjoyed the original Kickboxer, then check out Kickboxer: Vengeance.” - Screen Jabber.[14]
In 2016, Logothetis wrote and directed the sequel,Kickboxer: Retaliation, which introduced new characters, Mongkut, played byHafþór Júlíus Björnssonand Thomas Moore, played byChristopher Lambert.Kickboxer: Retaliationgot 92% from critics and 84% from the audience on Rotten Tomatoes.[15]Kickboxer: Retaliationis #6 Martial Arts Movie on Netflix with the Highest Rotten Tomatoes Score.[16]According to Men's Health, during the week of September 29, 2020, Kickboxer: Vengeance film was in the top 15 most viewed action films on Netflix.[17]"Kickboxer Retaliation" is one of the Best Action Movies of 2018"[18]and is in The Top 50 Action Gems of the Decade.[19]According to Forbes, “If you aren't watching the new Kickboxer movies, you're doing it wrong. As action reboots go, the Kickboxer remake films–Vengeance, and now Retaliation–nail the action vibe better than The Expendables movies ever did, and without necessarily pandering to nostalgia, either".[20]
2020 saw the release of Logothetis's science fiction martial arts filmJiu JitsustarringAlain Moussi,Nicolas Cage, andTony Jaa. Shot on the island ofCyprus, it was the beginning of a new martial arts franchise.[21]It was #4 on Netflix in the US and #1 on Netflix in Canada the week of its release.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
