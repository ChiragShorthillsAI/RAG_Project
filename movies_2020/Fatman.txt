Fatmanis a 2020 Americanblack comedyaction filmwritten and directed byEshom Nelms and Ian Nelms, and starringMel Gibson,Walton GogginsandMarianne Jean-Baptiste.[4][5]The film is an unorthodox slant on holiday traditions that follows a jaded, grittySanta Clauswho struggles withennui, production issues, government interference, and an embittered assassin sent by a vengeful naughty kid.[6]
Filmed in Canada and released worldwide on November 13, 2020, the film received mixed reviews from critics.
Chris Cringleandhis wifeRuth operate aChristmas present workshopon an old isolated farm near the small town of North Peak,Alaska. Struggling with declining revenue over the years due to children becoming increasingly vicious, the United States Government, who maintains an interest share in Chris's business because Christmas is a major economic stimulus, starts cutting back on their subsidies. To remedy Chris' income loss,US militaryCaptain Jacobs is sent to propose a two-month contract for producing jet fighter components, which is outright refused. The liaison agents override Chris's misgivings by implying that the next year's Government subsidies will likely decrease.  Ruth manages to restore Chris's spirits, who grudgingly accepts their offer only this one time.
Billy Wenan, an immoral and pernicious boy who lives with his ailingold moneygrandmother, is the quintessential vicious child who commits several despicable acts against people he considers inferior (i.e. threatening a girl who won first place in a science fair).  On Christmas Eve, Billy receives a lump of coal from Chris, swears revenge, and hireshit manJonathan Miller to assassinate Chris.  Miller, who harbors his own bitter childhood grudge against Chris, sets off on a killing spree, finds Chris collecting his mail from the Post Office, and follows him to his home.
On Chris's farm, Miller kills the US Army guards and infiltrates the workshop until an elf worker raises the alarm.  Jacobs evacuates the workers before Miller kills him and blows up the workshop.  Chris fights Miller and gains the upper hand, but Miller wounds Chris using a hidden blade and then shoots Chris in the head, leaving him for dead.  Ruth kills Miller afterwards, and Chrisrecoversfrom his injuries.
Backtracking Miller's assignment, Chris and Ruth pay a visit to Billy and interrupt him spiking his grandmother’s milk withfentanylto cover his check forgeries.  Irritated, Chris admits he has become lax when dealing with vicious children, and warns Billy that “the Fatman has an eye on you”, and will deal with him if he ever torments his fellow human beings again.  Back at the farm, Chris, Ruth, and the elves start rebuilding the workshop bigger and better with renewed confidence in the future.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
