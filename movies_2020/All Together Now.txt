Although he considers himself a director first and foremost, Haley says, "I learned very young that if I wanted to make independent films and get those films off the ground, then I needed to be a writer. For me, it was important to start writing and discover: what am I going to write about? How am I going to write it?...That’s when I learned that I needed a writing partner.

"I don't know how this kid came up with such a gem about 70-year-olds at 29, or whatever he was when he wrote it."[8]
Haley and his co-writer, Marc Basch, wroteThe Herospecifically for Sam Elliott, who starred alongside Danner inI'll See You in My Dreams. Haley describesThe Heroas his love letter to Elliott, saying that "Sam is the best. He is a true collaborator and an incredible actor and human being.

Armisen's mother was Venezuelan, born inSan Fernando de Apure,[9][10][11]while his father was born inSoltauto a German mother and Korean father.[11][12]For much of his life, Armisen thought his paternal grandfather Ehara Masami was Japanese. However, Masami (better known by his professional name Masami Kuni or birth name Park Yeong-in[11][13]) was actually Korean and came fromUlsan; he adopted a Japanese name and persona after themassacre of Koreans in 1923when he was a high school student.[14][11]Park studied aesthetics atTokyo Imperial Universityand became a professional dancer before moving to Germany.[15][13]After the war, he returned to Japan, and formed a premier modern dance company. He eventually immigrated to the US, where he taught dance at what is nowCal State Fullertonfrom 1964 to 1975.[13][12]Park Yeong-in's family were members of theKorean aristocracy, and Armisen's Korean lineage can be verifiably traced back to the 1600s.[12]

For some reason, I always thought it would be an indirect route; I didn't know that it would be comedy andSaturday Night Live. I just wanted to do something with performing that would lead me there."[26]
Armisen's subsequent television work, such as some "memorableAndy Kaufman–esque appearances"[27]onLate Night with Conan O'Brien, as well as work forCrank YankersandAdult Swim, led to a role in 2002 as a featured player in the cast ofSaturday Night Live.[27]In the 2004 season, he was promoted to repertory cast member.

Carol Creighton Burnett(born April 26, 1933) is an American comedian, actress, and singer. Her comedy-variety series,The Carol Burnett Show, which originally aired onCBS, was one of the first to be hosted by a woman.[1][2]Burnett has performed on Broadway, on television, and in dramatic and comedic film roles. She has receivednumerous awards and accolades, including sevenGolden Globe Awards, sevenPrimetime Emmy Awards, aTony Award, and aGrammy Award. Burnett was awarded thePresidential Medal of Freedomin 2005, theMark Twain Prize for American Humorin 2013, and theScreen Actors Guild Life Achievement Awardin 2015.[3][4]
Burnett was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas, until her family moved to Hollywood, living a block away from Hollywood Boulevard.[5]She attendedHollywood High Schooland eventually studied theater and musical comedy atUCLA. Later, she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 inOnce Upon a Mattress, for which she received aTony Awardnomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing onThe Garry Moore Showfor the next three years, and won her firstEmmy Awardin 1962.
Eventually, Burnett moved back to Los Angeles and began an 11-year run as star ofThe Carol Burnett Showon CBS television from 1967 to 1978. With itsvaudevilleroots,The Carol Burnett Showwas a variety show that combinedcomedy sketcheswith song and dance. The comedy sketches includedfilm parodiesand character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous Emmy andGolden Globe Awards. During and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects.
Burnett's film roles includePete 'n' Tillie(1972),The Front Page(1974),A Wedding(1978),The Four Seasons(1981),Annie(1982),Noises Off(1992), andHorton Hears a Who!(2008).

Burnett wrote and narrated several memoirs, earningGrammynominations for almost all of them, including a win forIn Such Good Company.[6][7]
In 2019, the Golden Globes created theCarol Burnett Awardfor career achievement in television, giving Burnett the first award.[8]She was honored with anNBCspecialCarol Burnett: 90 Years of Laughter + Lovecelebrating her 90th birthday.
Carol Creighton Burnett was born on April 26, 1933, at Nix Hospital in San Antonio, Texas, the daughter of Ina Louise (née Creighton), a publicity writer for movie studios, and Joseph Thomas Burnett, a movie theater manager.[10][11][12][13][14][15]Her maternal grandparents were William Henry Creighton (1873–1918) and Mabel Eudora "Mae" Jones (1885–1967).[16]Her parents divorced in the late 1930s. Subsequently, both parents independently moved to Hollywood and Burnett moved with her grandmother to a one-room apartment near her mother. They lived in an impoverished area of Hollywood, California,[17]in aboarding housewith Burnett's younger half-sister Chrissie.[citation needed]
When Burnett was in second grade, she briefly invented an imaginary twin sister named Karen, withShirley Temple-like dimples. She later recalled that, motivated to further the pretense, she "fooled the other boarders in the rooming house where we lived by frantically switching clothes and dashing in and out of the house by the fire escape and the front door. Then I became exhausted and Karen mysteriously vanished."[18]When Burnett was nine, she taught herself how to do the "Tarzan yell", which she realized years later was a good vocal exercise for volume,[19]and it became a fan favorite. Burnett's first experiences with singing were with her family. Her grandmother was a trained musician who could play the piano (although they did not have one at the time), and her mother played the ukulele, so they sometimes sang popular songs in harmony together around the kitchen table.[20]Her grandmother frequently took Burnett and her sister to the movies. They would take a few rolls of toilet paper home from the theater.[21]The movies she saw in her youth influenced the sketch content inThe Carol Burnett Show.[22]
Burnett worked as an usherette at the Warner Brothers Theater (now theHollywood Pacific Theatre). When the cinema screenedAlfred Hitchcock'sStrangers on a Train(1951), having already seen and enjoyed the film, she advised two patrons arriving during the last five minutes of a showing to wait until the beginning of the next showing to avoid spoiling the ending for them, but the couple insisted on being seated. The manager observed Burnett not letting the couple in and fired her, stripping theepaulettesfrom her uniform on the spot.[23]Years later in the 1970s after achieving TV stardom, when theHollywood Chamber of Commerceoffered her a star on theHollywood Walk of Fame, they asked her where she wanted it. She replied "Right in front of where the old Warner Brothers Theater was, at Hollywood and Wilcox", which is where it was placed,[13][24]at 6439 Hollywood Blvd.[25]
After graduating fromHollywood High Schoolin 1951, Burnett received an anonymous envelope containing $50 for one year's tuition atUCLA, where she initially planned on studying journalism.[19][26]During her first year of college, she switched her focus to theater arts and English, with the goal of becoming a playwright. She found she had to take an acting course to enter the playwright program. On the subject, she later reflected: "I wasn't really ready to do the acting thing, but I had no choice."[27]During her first performance, she got a sudden impulse to speak her lines in a new way. "Don't ask me why, but when we were in front of the audience, I suddenly decided I was going to stretch out all my words and my first line came out 'I'm baaaaaaaack!'"[27]The audience response moved her deeply:
They laughed and it felt great. All of a sudden, after so much coldness and emptiness in my life, I knew the sensation of all that warmth wrapping around me. I had always been a quiet, shy, sad sort of girl and then everything changed for me. You spend the rest of your life hoping you'll hear a laugh that great again.[27]
During this time, she performed in several university productions, garnering recognition for her comedic and musical abilities. Her mother disapproved of her acting ambitions:
She wanted me to be a writer. She said you can always write, no matter what you look like. When I was growing up she told me to be a little lady, and a couple of times I got a whack for crossing my eyes or making funny faces. Of course, she never, I never, dreamed I would ever perform.[18]
The young Burnett, always insecure about her looks, responded many years later to her mother's advice of "You can always write, no matter what you look like" by noting "God, that hurt!" in her memoirOne More Time(1986).
During her junior year at UCLA in 1954, a professor invited Burnett and some other students to perform at a party in place of their class final that had been canceled (which required a performance in front of an audience). Afterwards, a man and his wife approached her while Burnett was stuffing cookies in her purse to take home to her grandmother.[28]Instead of reprimanding her, the man complimented her performance and asked about her future plans. When he learned that she wanted to travel to New York in order to try her luck in musical comedy but could not afford the trip, he offered her and her boyfriend (Don Saroyan) each, on the spot, a $1,000 (equivalent to $11,709 in 2024) interest-free loan; the man, who was a millionaire fromLa Jolla, California, wasn't affiliated with show business and had earned his wealth from theshipbuildingindustry.[26]His conditions were simply that the loans were to be repaid within five years, his name was never to be revealed, and if she achieved success, she would help other aspiring talents to pursue their artistic dreams. Burnett took him up on his offer, and she and Saroyan left college and moved to New York to pursue acting careers. That same year, her father died of causes related to his alcoholism.[29]
Burnett spent her first year in New York working as a hat-check girl and trying to land acting jobs. She and other girls living at theRehearsal Club(a boarding house for women seriously pursuing acting careers) put onThe Rehearsal Club Revueon March 3, 1955. They mailed invitations to agents, who showed up along with stars likeCeleste HolmandMarlene Dietrich. Such attendance opened doors for several of the girls.[citation needed]
Burnett was cast in a minor role onThePaul Winchelland Jerry Mahoney Showin 1955. She played the girlfriend of a ventriloquist's dummy on the popular children's program. This role led to her starring role oppositeBuddy Hackettin the short-lived sitcomStanleyfrom 1956 to 1957.[citation needed]
AfterStanley, Burnett found herself unemployed for a short time. A few months later she bounced back, becoming highly popular as a performer on the New York circuit of cabarets and night clubs, most notably for a hit parody number called "I Made a Fool of Myself OverJohn Foster Dulles" (Dulles wasSecretary of Stateat the time). In 1957, she performed this number on bothThe Tonight ShowandThe Ed Sullivan Show. Dulles was asked about her onMeet the Pressand joked, "I never discuss matters of the heart in public."[30]Around this time she also worked as a regular on one of television's earliest game shows,Pantomime Quiz. On January 10, 1958, just as she was achieving her first small successes, her mother died. In October 1960, Burnett debuted at New York City'sBlue Angel Supper Club, where she was discovered by scouts forThe Jack Paar ShowandThe Ed Sullivan Show.[31]
Burnett's first true taste of success came with her appearance on Broadway in the 1959 musicalOnce Upon a Mattress, for which she was nominated for aTony Award; in the same year, she paid back her mysterious benefactor "to the day" after agreeing to her non-obligatoryunsecured loanof $1,000.[26]The same year, she became a regular player onThe Garry Moore Show, a job that lasted until 1962. She won an Emmy Award[32]that year for her "Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Musical Program or Series" on the show. She portrayed a number of characters, most memorably the put-upon cleaning woman. The character later became her signature alter-ego. With her success on theMoore Show, Burnett finally rose to headliner status and appeared in the specialJulie and Carol at Carnegie Hall(1962), co-starring with her friendJulie Andrews. The show was produced byBob Banner, directed byJoe Hamiltonand written byMike Nicholsand Ken Welch.[33]Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hallwon an Emmy Award for Outstanding Program Achievement in the Field of Music, and Burnett won an Emmy for her performance.[34]She also guest-starred on a number of shows during this time, includingThe Twilight Zoneepisode "Cavender Is Coming". In July 1963 Burnett starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production ofCalamity Jane[35]and had her television special debut in 1963 when CBS aired that production on November 12, 1963.[36]
In 1964, Burnett starred in the Broadway musicalFade Out – Fade Inbut was forced to withdraw after sustaining a neck injury in a taxi accident. She returned to the show later but withdrew again to participate in a variety show,The Entertainers, oppositeCaterina ValenteandBob Newhart. The producers ofFade Out – Fade Insued the actress for breach of contract after her absences from the popular show caused its failure, but the suit was later dropped.The Entertainersran for only one season.[37]Around the same time, Burnett became good friends withJim Nabors, who was enjoying great success with his seriesGomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.As a result of their close friendship, she played a recurring role on Nabors' show as a tough corporal and later as agunnery sergeant(starting with the episode"Corporal Carol"). Later, Nabors would be the first guest on her variety show each season, as she considered him to be her good-luck charm.[38]
In 1959,Lucille Ballbecame a friend and mentor to Burnett. After having guested on Burnett's highly successful CBS-TV specialCarol + 2(1966) and having the younger performer reciprocate by appearing onThe Lucy Show(1966–1967), it was rumored that Ball offered Burnett a chance to star on her own sitcom. In truth, Burnett was offered (but declined)Here's Agnesby CBS executives.[39]The two women remained close friends until Ball's death in 1989. Ball sent flowers every year on Burnett's birthday. When Burnett awoke on the day of her 56th birthday in 1989, she discovered via the morning news that Ball had died. Later that afternoon, flowers arrived at Burnett's house with a note reading, "Happy Birthday, Kid. Love, Lucy."[40]
In 1963 she made her feature film debut in comedyWho's Been Sleeping in My Bed?starring oppositeDean MartinandElizabeth Montgomery. Burnett said of her role in the film, "I should have been given the award for “Worst Performance Ever Given in Movies by an Actress.” I was confused, bored and I missed the [live] audience. Nothing was spontaneous."[41]During this time she acted in the CBS variety showThe EntertainersalongsideBob Newhartand in an episode of theMel BrooksandBuck Henrycreated spy comedy seriesGet Smartin 1966.
In 1967, after CBS offered BurnettHere's Agnes, she exercised a stipulation in her ten-year contract with CBS that said she had five years from the dateThe Garry Moore Showended to "push the button" on hosting thirty one-hour episodes of a music/comedy variety show.[39][42]As a result, the hour-longCarol Burnett Showwas born and debuted in September 1967, eventually garnering 23Emmy Awardsand winning or being nominated for multiple Emmy andGolden Globe Awardsevery season it was on the air. Its ensemble cast includedTim Conway(who was a guest player until the ninth season),[43]Harvey Korman,Lyle Waggonerand the teenagedVicki Lawrence, whom Burnett discovered and mentored. The network initially did not want her to do a variety show because it believed only men could be successful at variety, but her contract required that it give her one season of whatever kind of show she wanted to make.[39][44]She chose to carry on the tradition of past variety show successes. During this time Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on the children's seriesSesame Street, appearing on that series' first episode on November 10, 1969.[45]She also made occasional returns to the stage in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1974, she appeared atthe MunyTheatre inSt. Louis, Missouri, inI Do! I Do!withRock Hudson.
A true variety show,The Carol Burnett Showstruck a chord with viewers. Among other subjects, it parodied films (Went with the Wind!forGone with the Wind), television (As the Stomach Turnsfor the soap operaAs the World Turns) and commercials. There were also frequent musical numbers. Burnett and her team struck gold with the original sketch "The Family", which eventually was spun off into the television showMama's Family, starringVicki Lawrence. She opened most shows with an impromptu question-and-answer session with the audience, lasting a few minutes, during which she often demonstrated her ability to humorously ad lib. On numerous occasions, she obliged when asked to perform her trademark[46]Tarzan yell. She ended each show by tugging on her left ear, which was a message to her grandmother. This was done to let her know that she was doing well and that she loved her. During the show's run, her grandmother died. On anIntimate Portraitepisode about Burnett, she tearfully recalled her grandmother's last moments: "She said to my husband Joe from her hospital bed 'Joe, you see that spider up there?' There was no spider, but Joe said he did anyhow. She said 'Every few minutes a big spider jumps on that little spider and they go at it like rabbits!!' And then she died. There's laughter in everything!"[47]
She continued the tradition of tugging her ear. The show ceased production in 1978. Four post-script episodes were produced and aired onABCduring the summer of 1979 under the titleCarol Burnett & Company. The productions used essentially the same format and, with the exception of Harvey Korman and Lyle Waggoner, the same supporting cast. Beginning in 1977, the comedy sketches of her series were edited into half-hour episodes for syndication entitledCarol Burnett and Friends, which for many years proved to be extremely popular in syndication. In the digital age, the series began airing onMeTVin January 2015.[citation needed]Burnett starred in a few films while her variety show was running, includingPete 'n' Tillie(1972) andThe Front Page(1974). She was nominated for an Emmy in 1974 for her role in the drama6 Rms Riv Vu.  The show's enduring popularity surprised many when a 2001 retrospective containing outtakes and discussions with the cast, and a tribute toBob Mackie, drew in 30 million viewers, topping the Emmy Awards as well as all but the final game of that year'sWorld Series.[29]Her Grammy-winning memoirIn Such Good Companyis about the show, and Burnett tells about how it was developed, with anecdotes about improvisations, the cast, crew, and guests.[citation needed]
After her show ended, she assumed a number of roles that departed from comedy. She appeared in several dramatic roles, most notably in the television movieFriendly Fire. She appeared as Beatrice O'Reilly in the filmLife of The Party: The Story of Beatrice, a story about a woman fighting her alcoholism.[48]Her other film work includesRobert Altman's comedy-dramaA Wedding(1978),Alan Alda's romantic comedyThe Four Seasons(1981),John Huston's musical filmAnnie(1982), andPeter Bogdanovich's comedyNoises Off(1992). She took the supporting role of Carlotta Campion in the 1985 concert performance ofStephen Sondheim'sFollies. In 1995, after an absence of 30 years, she was back on Broadway inMoon Over Buffalo, for which she was nominated for aTony Award for Best Actress in a Play. Four years later, she appeared in the Broadway revuePutting It Together.
In the 1980s and 1990s, she made several attempts at starting a new variety program. She also appeared briefly onThe Carol Burnett Show's"The Family" sketches' spinoff,Mama's Family, as her stormy character,Eunice Higgins. She played the matriarch in thecultcomedy miniseriesFresno, which parodied the primetime soap operaFalcon Crest.

Books
Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.
In 1976, a false report in thetabloidnewspaperThe National Enquirerincorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of StateHenry Kissingerin attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her. Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against theEnquirerin 1981. Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 after a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims oftabloid journalism.[111][112][113][114][115][116][117]
Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation
In 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against20th Century Foxdemanding at least $2 million in damages after an animated likeness of Burnett appeared in the 2006 episode "Peterotica" of the animated sitcomFamily Guy. In the episode, the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop,Glenn Quagmirestating that it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor. Burnett is then shown as her well-knowncharwomancharacter, mopping the floor in the porn shop, while a modified version of "Carol's Theme", the theme song used inThe Carol Burnett Show, plays. The characters subsequently discuss Burnett's ear tug and make a crude comment about it. The lawsuit alleged copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights and misappropriation of Burnett's name and likeness. In addition to damages, Burnett and her company demanded that Fox remove all references to her, the theme and the character. The studio refused.[118][119]The court ruled in favor of the defendant because the bit was a parody, which is protected by theFirst Amendment, particularly byFair Usedoctrine.[120]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
