Let Them All Talkis a 2020 Americancomedy-dramafilm directed bySteven Soderberghfrom a screenplay byDeborah Eisenberg. The film starsMeryl Streep,Dianne Wiest,Candice Bergen,Lucas Hedges, andGemma Chan. Much of the dialogue was improvised by the cast, and Soderbergh shot the film using natural light and little equipment aboard theQueen Mary 2.
Let Them All Talkwas released onHBO Maxon December 10, 2020.
Alice Hughes is aPulitzer Prize-winning author working on her latest manuscript, which her publisher hopes will be a sequel to her best-known work,You Always/You Never. Alice is due to receive a literary award in the United Kingdom but is unable to fly due to her health, leading her agent Karen to suggest she make thetransatlantic crossingon theQueen Mary 2. Alice invites her nephew Tyler to assist her while on the voyage, and her university friends Roberta and Susan, with whom she has lost touch. Alice and Roberta have a difficult relationship stemming from Roberta's belief that Alice used details about her inYou Always/You Never, which Roberta feels derailed her life. Unbeknownst to Alice, Karen joins them on the ship, hoping to learn details about Alice's new book.
Once on the ship, Karen strikes up a friendship with Tyler, using him to gain information from Alice. Alice tells Tyler that the book is about "trying to catch lightning in a bottle for a second time", possibly implying that it will be a sequel to previous work. She spends the majority of her time writing, only taking breaks to eat and swim. Roberta attempts to attract wealthy men on board, while Susan begins interacting with Kelvin Kranz, another writer; Kranz writes popularmysteryandthrillerbooks, which Alice dismisses. Kranz also knows Karen and advises her not to pry into the details of Alice's work. Roberta attempts to meet with Alice to seek an apology and acknowledgment of Alice's use of her life details – a fact that Alice has never admitted to – but the two fail to connect. Alice runs into Tyler and Karen together and learns that Tyler has a romantic interest in Karen. Tyler and Karen have dinner, where Tyler's romantic advances are rejected. Alice invites Karen to dinner with the foursome, where tensions come to a head between Alice and Roberta after Karen asks about the new book. They are interrupted by Susan, who accuses them both of being selfish and holding onto their bitterness. Alice decides to delete her book, implied to be a sequel toYou Always/You Neveras both Karen and Roberta expected.
After disembarking the ship, Alice and Roberta have a conversation about their estrangement. Roberta tells Alice that she will provide her with the life details Alice would need to write a sequel toYou Always/You Never, but wants a share of the profits in return. Alice rejects this offer and they part with Roberta telling Alice "I loved you when you were Al." That evening, Alice begins work on a new writing project.
The next morning, a man that Tyler saw frequently coming out of Alice's room on the ship greets him at Alice's door. He reveals that he is Dr. Mitchell, Alice'spersonal physicianand that Alice has died in the night fromdeep vein thrombosis; Dr. Mitchell was aboard the ship to administer injections of ablood thinningmedication to Alice.
Tyler, Roberta, and Susan visit the grave of 19th-century author Blodwyn Pugh, as Alice had intended them to. Back in the United States, Roberta gives Alice's writing, which she took from Alice's room after her death, to Karen in the hopes of profiting from it. Karen maintains that the work is unfinished and cannot be published, but encourages Roberta's idea of writing a book about her life experiences. Susan works with Krantz on a new book based on an idea of hers she shared with him aboard the ship. Tyler receives Alice's unfinished writing from Karen and returns it to her apartment, recalling a talk Alice made celebrating the existence of consciousness and the ability of people to affect each other.
In August 2019, it was announcedMeryl StreepandGemma Chanwould star in the film, withSteven Soderberghdirecting from a screenplay byDeborah Eisenberg.[3][4]Later that month, it was announcedHBO Maxhad acquired the distribution rights to the film, along with the additions ofCandice Bergen,Dianne WiestandLucas Hedgesto the cast.[5]
Production began in August 2019 in New York City and continued on board theCunardocean linerRMSQueen Mary 2as it crossed the Atlantic, lasting two weeks. Soderbergh only used the story outline written by Eisenberg, and allowed the actors to improvise much of their dialogue.[6]Soderbergh served as the film editor and cinematographer. According to Wiest, Soderbergh "held the camera in a wheelchair and just rolled along," and sound was the only equipment used. Streep said she was paid 25 cents for her role.[7]
The film was released digitally on December 10, 2020, byHBO Max.[8]
According to thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 88% of 114 critic reviews are positive, with the average rating of 7.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "When Steven Soderbergh rounds up a cast this talented, it's definitely wise toLet Them All Talk—and this light yet rewarding dramedy more than lives up to expectations."[9]OnMetacritic, the film was assigned a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 31 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[10]
Leah Greenblatt ofEntertainment Weeklygave the film an A− and described it as "a chance to spend two hours watching Streep & Co. make the most of Deborah Eisenberg's deliciously salty script, while Soderbergh—who also serves as cinematographer—shoots it all in ruthless, radiant light."[11]

Max, also known asHBO Max,[b]is an Americansubscription video on-demandover-the-topstreamingservice. It is a proprietary unit ofWarner Bros. Discovery Global Streaming & Games, which is itself a division ofWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD).[2]The platform offers content from thelibrariesofWarner Bros.,Discovery,HBO,CNN,Cartoon Network,Adult Swim,Animal Planet,TBS,TNT,Eurosport, and their related brands. Max first launched (as HBO Max) in the United States on May 27, 2020.
The service also carries first-run original programming under the "Max Originals" banner, programming from the HBOpay televisionservice, and content acquired via either third-party library deals (such as those with film studios for pay television rights) or co-production agreements (including, among others, those withBBC StudiosandSesame Workshop).
When the service was first launched as HBO Max, it succeeded bothHBO Now, a previous HBO SVOD service; andHBO Go, theTV Everywherestreaming platform for HBO pay television subscribers. In the United States, HBO Now subscribers and HBO pay television subscribers were migrated to HBO Max at no additional charge, subject to availability and device support. HBO Max also supplanted the streaming component ofDC Entertainment'sDC Universeservice, with its original series being migrated to HBO Max as Max Originals. The HBO Max service began to expand into international markets in 2021.
According toAT&T,[c]HBO and HBO Max had a combined total of 69.4 million paying subscribers globally on June 30, 2021, including 43.5 million HBO Max subscribers in the U.S., 3.5 million HBO-only U.S. subscribers (primarily commercial customers like hotels), and 20.5 million subscribers to either HBO Max or HBO by itself in other countries.[3]By the end of 2021, HBO and HBO Max had a combined total of 73.8 million paying global subscribers.[4][5]At the end of Q1 2022, HBO and HBO Max had 76.8 million global subscribers.[6]
Since the April 2022 merger ofWarnerMediawithDiscovery, Inc.to form Warner Bros. Discovery, Max is one of the combined company's two flagship streaming services, the other beingDiscovery+(which primarily focuses onfactualandrealityprogramming from the Discovery brands). WBD initially announced plans for HBO Max and Discovery+ to merge in 2023, but the company ultimately chose to retain Discovery+. As part of the decision, WBD migrated some Discovery+ shows to Max whilst also leaving them on Discovery+. WBD went on to replace HBO Max with a newly rebranded service, shortening the service's name to "Max", which launched in the United States on May 23, 2023, in Latin America on February 27, 2024, and in Europe on May 21, 2024, introducing a redesigned user interface, and adding more Discovery content. The rebrand was also applied to Netherlands, Poland, France, and several other regions in 2024. In Belgium and the Netherlands the name "HBO Max" was retained with a new Max logo.
On October 10, 2018, WarnerMedia announced that it would launch anover-the-topstreaming servicein late 2019, featuring content from its entertainment brands.[7]The original plan for the service called for three tiers with a late 2019 launch.[8]Randall L. Stephenson, chairman and CEO of WarnerMedia's parent,AT&Tindicated in mid-May 2019 that it would use the HBO brand and would tie into cable operators as HBO cable subscribers would have access to the streaming service. A beta was expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a full launch in the first quarter of 2020 at the time.[9]
Otter Mediawas transferred in May 2019 to WarnerMedia Entertainment fromWarner Bros.to take over the streaming service as Brad Bentley, executive vice president and general manager of direct-to-consumer development, exited the post after six months. Andy Forssell transferred from being the chief operating officer of Otter to replace Bentley as executive vice president and general manager while still reporting to Otter CEO Tony Goncalves, who would lead development.[10]
On July 9, 2019, WarnerMedia announced that the service would be known as HBO Max and that it would launch in spring 2020, whileReese Witherspoon'sHello SunshineandGreg Berlantiwere signed to production deals for the service. (The "Max" moniker is shared with HBO's sister linear pay television serviceCinemax, which has alternately identified by its suffix name since the mid-1980s and used it prominently in its branding from 2008 to 2011.)[11]On October 29, 2019, it was announced that HBO Max would officially launch in May 2020.[12]
On January 8, 2020, AT&T announced thatAudience, a channel exclusive to subscribers of AT&T-owned television providers such asDirecTVwith some original programming, would be sunset on May 22, eventually transitioning to abarker channelfor HBO Max.[13]Warner Bros.and HBO Max announced theWarner Maxfilm label on February 5, 2020, which would produce eight to ten mid-budget movies per year for the streaming service starting in 2020.[14]On April 20, 2020, WarnerMedia announced HBO Max's launch date as May 27.[15]Later that year on October 23, it was announced that WarnerMedia decided to consolidate the Warner Max label into the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after its chairman,Toby Emmerich, and his development and production team led by Courtenay Valenti of Warner Bros. Pictures, Richard Brener of New Line and Walter Hamada (who oversees DC-based films), was put to manage the company's entire film output, both theatrical and streaming releases.[16][17][18]
In July 2022, as a part of a cost-cutting and strategic move following the merger ofDiscovery, Inc.with WarnerMedia to formWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD), it was reported that HBO Max had ceased new original series development inCentral Europe,Nordic Europe, the Netherlands, and Turkey, as well as removed selected international series from the platform worldwide. It was reported that France and Spain had been largely excluded from these cuts, due to French regulations requiring streaming services to produce domestic content, and Spanish-language content appealing to a wide range of markets served by HBO Max.[19][20][21]With the cancellation ofGordita Chronicleslater that month, it was reported that the service was also abandoning development of live-action children's and family programming.[22]
On August 3, 2022, it was reported that multiple Max Original films and HBO series had been quietly removed from the service without prior notice as part of cuts to direct-to-streaming films. The company thenwrote offfilms and series that had underperformed on the service.[23][24]It was also thought that avoiding payment forresidualsplayed a part.[25]This followed news that had broken the previous day that then-upcoming Max Original filmsBatgirlandScoob! Holiday Haunthad been both abruptly cancelled, despite being nearly complete.[26][27]During an earnings call the next day, WBD CEODavid Zaslavstated that the company would cut children's programming and emphasize theatrical films over direct-to-streaming releases.[28][29]
Later that month, more programs were pulled from the streaming service, including animated and unscripted series such asThe Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo,Final Space,Summer Camp Island,Infinity Train,Close Enough, and nearly 200 episodes ofSesame Street, among others,[30][31]which was met with heavy backlash from fans, critics, actors, and creators alike.[32][33][34]On August 24, 2022, the HBO Max original filmsHouse Party(which was pulled from its slate just 17 days before its release) andEvil Dead Risewere both shifted to theatrical releases.[35]WBD later reached licensing deals with thefree ad-supported streaming television(FAST) servicesThe Roku ChannelandTubi(owned byFox Corporation) in 2023; the deal covers over 2,000 hours of library programming, some of which being shows that had been pulled from HBO Max.[36][37]
During its third-quarter earnings report in November 2022, WBD stated that the merged service was now targeting a "Spring 2023" launch in the U.S., ahead of the original schedule. Perrette also stated of a potential price increase for HBO Max's ad-free tier in 2023, explaining that it was "an opportunity, particularly in this environment".[38]A price hike for the ad-free tier in the U.S. was later announced on January 12, 2023, which saw the price raised by $1 to $15.99 a month (the yearly plan would be unaffected by this move), effective immediately for new subscribers, while current subscribers would see the price hike starting on February 11, 2023.[39]
On March 14, 2022, after Discovery shareholders approved its merger with WarnerMedia, Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels stated that the company planned to pursue an eventual merger of HBO Max with its own streaming serviceDiscovery+. Wiedenfels stated that this process would most likely begin with a bundle of the two services as a short-term option, with a long-term goal to eventually merge the services into one platform.[40]
During an earnings call in August 2022, WBD head of Global Streaming and Interactive JB Perrette revealed that Discovery+ and HBO Max would merge "next Summer", with the unified service launching first in the United States, and rolled out to other markets beginning in late-2023.[29]When announcing the merged service, Zaslav did not immediately indicate whether it would continue to carry the HBO brand. He stated that HBO was one of the "great crown jewels of the company" and would "always be the beacon and the ultimate brand that stands for the best of television quality".[41]In early-December 2022, it was reported by CNBC via inside sources that multiple names were being considered—including simply "Max".[42][43]
In February 2023, Zaslav revealed during an earnings call that WBD would officially announce the service on April 12.[44]He also announced that WBD would continue operating Discovery+ in conjunction with the service rather than shut it down, stating that it was profitable, and that its subscribers were "very happy with the product offering".[44]One day before the scheduled announcement,The New York Timesconfirmed that the service would be called "Max", and that it would retain HBO Max's existing pricing and be available in multiple price tiers for six months (on December 5 its legacy ad-free tier will be removed with former users in this tier downgrading to the ad-free tier after this date).[45][46]WBD acquired the max.comdomain nameearlier that year from Max International, anutritional supplementcompany.[47]
WBD officially unveiled Max on April 12: the new service would first launch in the United States on May 23, and in other regions throughout 2023 and 2024. While the new service maintains similar price points to HBO Max, support for4K resolutionvideo andDolby Atmosbecame exclusive to the new "Ultimate" tier, and the ad-free plan was also reduced from four concurrent streams to two.[48]In addition to all Warner Bros. Pictures releases from 2023 onward, WBD plans to have more library films and television series available on Max in 4K.[47][49][48]
Perrette explained that the HBO branding had been dropped from the service's name so that it could be associated with itsoriginal programmingas a flagship brand on Max, rather than having to be associated with the entirety of its library—which included children's and family programming at odds with HBO having traditionally been associated withpremiumand adult-oriented programming.[50][51]The Max logo was designed by the British agency DixonBaxi, and incorporates elements of both the HBO and Warner Bros. logos, including a center-dotted "a" resembling the center-dotted "O" from the HBO logo, and the "m" and "x" letters containing curves based on Warner Bros.' long-time shield logo. The service also changed its corporate color from purple to blue, in homage to Warner Bros.' historical use of blue-colored logos.[52][53]
The rebrand was promoted with the tagline "The one to watch".[54][55]Pato Spagnoletto, chief marketing officer of Warner Bros. Discovery Streaming, identified the campaign as the largest marketing spend in company history.[53][56]WBD's stock fell by nearly six percent after Max's announcement.[57]Within the first 3 months of Max's rebrand, WBD lost 1.8 million subscribers across their streaming platforms, but attributed it to an overlap of subscribers of Max and Discovery+, as well as expected churn.[58]In November 2023, it was reported that WBD lost 2.5 million subscribers over a six-month period, with their shares falling 19% as a result.[59]
In May 2024, WBD announced a partnership with Disney to offer a bundle of Max with its competitorsDisney+andHuluin the United States, It was launched on July 25, 2024, at a price of $16.99 per-month for ad-supported, and $29.99 per-month for ad-free.[60][61]
Existing HBO Max subscribers were grandfathered under their current plan features for least six months, following that period all legacy ad free customers were moved to the ad free tier (existing ad supported were moved to the ad lite tier).[64][46]
HBO Max was formed under WarnerMedia's Entertainment division, then headed byRobert Greenblatt.Kevin Reilly, president of WarnerMedia Entertainment Networks, which includes most of the company's ad-supported entertainment channels such asTBS,TNT, andTruTV, was also given the role of as chief content officer of HBO Max with responsibility for HBO Max-exclusive original programming and library content. Andy Forssell was named the service's executive vice president and general manager while still reporting toOtter MediaCEO Tony Goncalves, who leads development.[11]Casey Bloys, programming president of HBO, retained oversight of the core HBO service but was not initially involved with Max-exclusive programming.
On August 7, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a significant restructuring under new presidentJason Kilar, which he described as "leaning into this great moment of change" towards direct-to-consumer services. As a result, Greenblatt and Reilly both left the company. WarnerMedia Entertainment was dissolved, with programming operations combined with Warner Bros. in a new Studios and Networks group under that studio's CEO Ann Sarnoff. Bloys was given complete programming oversight of HBO and HBO Max, as well as Reilly's other previous responsibilities, reporting to Sarnoff. Forssell became the head of a new HBO Max operating business unit, reporting directly to Kilar.[65]On April 23, 2021,Adult Swimand HBO Max's adult animation development teams merged under the leadership of Suzanna Makkos.[66]
On August 15, 2022, HBO was reorganized by Warner Bros. Discovery, resulting in layoffs within HBO Max's non-scripted originals, live-action family originals, international originals, and casting units (HBO itself never had an in-house casting department). Makkos also began reporting to HBO's head of comedy Amy Gravitt.[67][68]
Max features first-run and library content from HBO and other Warner Bros. film and television studios and brands.[69][70][71]The service also includes films available through HBO's existing pay television rights that are sourced fromWarner Bros. Picturesonly.[70][72][73][74]
As with HBO's other streaming platforms,HBO GoandHBO Now(but as opposed to its add-on services onPrime Video Channels,YouTube Primetime Channelsand, until its removal from that platform in 2021,Apple TV Channels), Max originally did not include feeds of HBO's linear cable channels,[75]nor does it include any content fromCinemax.[76]Though Cinemax shares its film content with the linear HBO channel, and therefore the majority of films in the combined library will be on both services in different windows, these films will not necessarily be available on both Max and Cinemax at the same time.[77]
On December 4, 2024, Max added a “Channels” tab offering live feeds of HBO and its linear multiplex channels (with the exception of HBO Family and HBO Latino). Initially available on a limited basis to U.S. subscribers of Max’s Ad-Free and Ultimate Ad-Free tiers using adult profiles, the feature will allow users to restart, rewind and fast-forward, and navigate between streams of the linear channel feeds directly from within the player.[78][79]
First and third-party content providers for Max. Asterisk (*) denotes third parties while cross (†) denotes former providers.
Original content produced will be under the bannerMax Originals, including series, films, and specials.Original episodic content is released weekly, eschewing the "binge" format made popular byNetflix.Kevin Reillystated this was to ensure that originals would remain in the spotlight for extended periods, by letting said shows "breathe" as opposed to "fading quickly after a binge and burn". He also noted that the weekly schedule helped to drive the success of past HBO shows likeSuccessionandChernobylwhich they co-produced withSky UK, and became hits precisely due to their staying power.[87]
A slate of 31 original series were planned for its first year, with plans to expand to 50 for its next year, but production timelines may have been interrupted by theCOVID-19 pandemic.[70]Max also has podcasts about the films and TV series on the service.[90]It also produces original podcasts exclusively for the service, withBatman: The Audio Adventuresbeing the first.[91]

On July 9, 2019, HBO Max acquired the U.S. streaming rights toFriendsin a $425 million deal,[11][70]and on September 17, 2019, acquired the U.S. streaming rights toThe Big Bang Theory, as part of a deal that also extends TBS's off-network rights to the series through 2028.[92]

Over 700 episodes of BBC content were available on the service at launch, including the first 11 seasons of the 2005Doctor Whorevival, as well as future seasons twelve through fourteen, and a variety of other shows includingThe Honourable Woman,Luther,Top Gear, and the original British version ofThe Office.

In late 2020, due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, WarnerMedia moved two Warner Bros. films originally intended as major theatrical releases to either exclusive or simultaneous releases on HBO Max.The Witcheswas released exclusively on HBO Max in the U.S. on October 22,[133]andWonder Woman 1984debuted simultaneously in North American theaters and on HBO Max on December 25, although the latter was initially only available on the service for a month.[134]Week-long free trials were discontinued in December 2020.[135]
On December 3, 2020, it was announced that the studio's entire 2021 film lineup would see a simultaneous theatrical release and a one-month limited release on the streaming service, starting withThe Little Thingson January 29.[136]Subsequent films released under the same-day theatrical/streaming window to date wereJudas and the Black Messiah(February 12),[137][138]Tom and Jerry(February 26),Godzilla vs. Kong(March 31),Mortal Kombat(April 23),Those Who Wish Me Dead(May 14),The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It(June 4),In the Heights(June 10),Space Jam: A New Legacy(July 16),The Suicide Squad(August 5),Reminiscence(August 20),Malignant(September 10),Cry Macho(September 17),The Many Saints of Newark(October 1),Dune(October 22),King Richard(November 19), andThe Matrix Resurrections(December 22). Standard release windows applied to each film after their initial limited-run streaming release on the service; HBO Max would then reassume streaming rights to the aforementioned Warner Bros. films upon their respective pay television premieres on the linear HBO service in mid-to-late 2021 or 2022, depending on the scheduled start of their individual HBO exhibition agreements.[139][140]
This decision, called "Project Popcorn" within Warner Bros.,[141]was met with backlash from filmmakers, production companies, theDirectors Guild of America, theCreative Artists Agency, and movie theater owners as Warner Bros. had not informed anyone about their plan ahead of the announcement.[142][143][144][145][146]Viewership of the films varied, withMortal Kombatreaching 3.8 million,The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do Ittotaling 1.6 million, andIn the Heightstotaling 693,000 (according toSamba TV, as WarnerMedia does not report viewership numbers for HBO Max).[147]
Warner Bros. spent over $200million alone compensating talent for the shift to streaming;Deadlinereported in January 2022 that such a business move "will never occur again given its high cost".[141]
In March 2021, it was announced that Warner Bros. would discontinue same-day releases in 2022, as part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas) and will instead use a 45-day exclusive release window for theaters.[148]The Matrix Resurrectionswas the final film released in 2021 as part of Project Popcorn. The 45-day release window for HBO Max was only used for two films (The BatmanandFantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore) before it was reported in August 2022 that as part of a restructuring of Warner Bros' film distribution strategy following the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc, the length of the window would now be decided for each film on a case-by-case basis.[149]
On August 13, 2023, CNN announced a new streaming news hub on Max known asCNN Maxto launch on September 27, which features a mix of original news programs and simulcasts of primetime programs from CNN's U.S. andinternationallinear networks.[150][151]CNN Internationalwill be also available through Max in European countries such as France and Poland.[152]
CNN had previously attempted a standalone subscription service in 2022,CNN+, but was closed almost immediately after the completion of the WarnerMedia/Discovery merger due to it conflicting with the company's goal of having one streaming service to encompass all WBD properties.[153][154]
Beginning on March 30, 2025, Max announced that it will be removing this feature on the Basic with ads plan.[155]
On March 1, 2022, Turner Sports announced an eight-year deal to hold rights toUnited States men'sandwomen'snational soccer team home matches, such as FIFA World Cup qualifying and international friendlies. This excludesFIFAandCONCACAFevents, whose rights are held by Fox, and away matches. It was stated that at least half the matches per-season would be exclusive to HBO Max.[156]The first match was streamed on January 17, 2023.[157]
On October 5, 2023, Max announced plans to launch a new sports-focused tier in the United States, to be known initially as theBleacher ReportSports add-on. The tier would feature live sporting events and studio shows fromTNT Sports, includingMajor League Baseball(MLB), theNational Basketball Association(NBA), theNational Hockey League(NHL), and theNCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, as well as exclusive USA Soccer matches and programs, and select on-demand content.[158][159]On December 14, 2023, amid the closure of theGCN+service, WBD announced that its programming rights would be consolidated into the sports add-on in February 2024, including theGiro d'Italiaand variousUCItours and events.[160]
The service was to be available as a free preview until February 29, 2024, after which it was to become an $9.99 add-on on top of an existing Max subscription. However, amid changes to TNT Sports' portfolio (including its impending loss of rights to the NBA in 2025, and other acquisitions such as college sports and international events such as theFrench Open), the launch of the sports add-on as a paid service was delayed indefinitely.[158][159]On February 26, 2025, it was announced that the add-on had been scrapped as part of a change in strategy, and that live sports content would be available at no additional charge as part of the "Standard" and "Premium" tiers of Max (as B/R sports on Max). JB Perrette stated that WBD had been "actively involved in exploring ways to evolve the sports distribution ecosystem in the U.S.", and that offering sports content as part of the existing tiers was the best option for subscribers.[161][162]
Similar to the Bleacher Report Sports add-on in the United States, a sports-focused tier will be added to Max in Europe during its launch over the summer of 2024 in conjunction with its pan-European sports brandEurosport. This tier will offer the linear channelsEurosport 1andEurosport 2, and coverage for various sports events including the2024 Summer Olympics, Giro d'Italia,Vuelta a España, andTour de France.[152]
On July 9, 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery announced thatTNT Sportswill arrive at Max in Chile the week of July 15 with an innovative proposal where sports fans will be able to subscribe independently or by adding it to the platform's available plans. It will include live events and original content.
The most relevant Chilean soccer competitions are added, such as theChilean Primera División,Primera B,Copa Chileand original programming, among others.[1]
From February 2025,TNT Sportscontent will be available to users with a subscription toPack Fútbolwith their enabled cable operator and to TNT Sports subscribers independently.
From October 24, 2024, in Spain, Max has added a newMax DAZNpackage that will cost €44.99 per month, in addition to the Sports package that is optional for the Standard and Premium plans, it includes fourDAZNchannels in addition toEurosportwith the best sport that fans could wish for.
LaLiga, theUFC, or theFormula 1andMotoGPworld championships will be available to subscribers of theMax DAZNPackage, in addition to having all the movies, series and documentaries on the platform with the same advantages as the Premium Plan[163]
At launch, HBO Max did not support4K,HDR,Dolby Vision, orDolby Atmos, but support for these technologies were planned as "part of the HBO Max product roadmap".[164][165]Support for 4K, HDR, and Atmos was added starting with the release ofWonder Woman 1984,[166][non-primary source needed]with WarnerMedia promising to add more content in these formats throughout 2021 and beyond.[167]
The service providedclosed captioningsupport at launch, but initially lacked support foraudio description(AD) for those with visual impairments.[168]In October 2020, theAmerican Council of the Blindannounced it had reached a settlement with WarnerMedia whereby at least 1,500 hours of HBO Max content will be available with AD by the end of March 2021, increasing to at least 6,000 hours by March 2023, along with otheraccessibilityenhancements to the website and apps by September 2021.[169]HBO Max later began rolling out AD on select titles on March 26, 2021.[170]
The majority of active subscribers to the HBO pay TV service (which previously included HBO Go), and most customers that were subscribed to HBO Now at time of launch, can access HBO Max for no extra charge, with all three services generally sharing the same price point of $14.99 per month. However, this transition is contingent on the customer's current provider or biller having signed a new distribution agreement for HBO Max with WarnerMedia.[75][171]
On May 27, 2020, as part of an agreement with Time Warner that renewed its carriage contract for theTurner Broadcasting Systemnetworks and gave its over-the-top television serviceSling TVdistribution rights to the linear HBO channel.Dish Networksecured an option to become a distribution partner for HBO Max following the exclusivity period with Apple.[172][173]HBO content is also available as a premium add-on forDirecTV StreamandHulufor the same $14.99 price as HBO Max.[174]
In announcing HBO Max, WarnerMedia immediately confirmed that HBO subscribers on AT&T-owned platforms (includingAT&T TV,DirecTV,U-verse, andAT&T Mobility) would receive HBO Max on-launch at no additional charge.[175][176]AT&T customers who are subscribed to their highest-tiered internet, TV and wireless plans would also receive HBO Max for free, while those on lower-tiered plans will get a free trial ranging from one month to one year.[177]Existing HBO Now subscribers billed directly by HBO were also migrated to HBO Max on-launch at no additional charge. On April 27, 2020, an agreement was announced for HBO Now subscribers via Apple (both in-app subscriptions andApple TV Channels) to be migrated to HBO Max. Content from HBO Max would be listed in theApple TV appalong with there being a dedicated HBO Max hub in the app.[178][179]OnApple TVdevices, HBO Max is available to the regular fourth generation Apple TV and fifth and sixth generationApple TV 4K; earlier versions which do not support third-party app download are not supported.
WarnerMedia subsequently negotiated with other pay TV providers for similar arrangements.[171]On February 20, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a distribution deal withYouTube TVthat would allow members to add HBO and Cinemax, while also being able to include HBO Max as an add-on.[180]On April 15, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a similar deal withCharterSpectrum(which acquired Warner's formercable divisionafter it was spun off in 2009, in May 2016) to give access to HBO Max for HBO subscribers via theirTV Everywherecredentials.[181]A similar agreement was announced withHuluon May 1 for most existing subscribers via Hulu + Live TV, as well as being available as an add-on to all other plans on the service.[182]On May 20, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia had made distribution deals withAltice USA,Cox Communications,Xbox,Samsung,PlayStation,Verizon Communicationsand the National Cable Television Cooperative (NCTC).[183]An agreement withComcast(Xfinity) was announced a few hours after the platform's launch.[184]Max is also available onXfinityFlex andCoxContour Stream Player.[185][186]
The most prominent platforms without agreements to carry HBO Max at the launch wereAmazon(maker of theFire TVandFire HDdevices) andRoku, which together are estimated to control 70% of the U.S. streaming player market.[184]With both platforms, non-Max HBO content remained available as usual through the companies' respective channels platforms and/or through HBO Now (which was rebranded to just "HBO" on July 31, 2020) while deals for HBO Max were being worked out. On May 13, 2020,John Stankey, CEO of AT&T, revealed toVarietythat Amazon was very unlikely to become a launch partner for HBO Max; the parties have remained at an impasse following the launch, reportedly due to a disagreement about whether Amazon can host the additional Max programming directly on itsAmazon Prime VideoChannels platform as it does for HBO currently.[187][184]On November 16, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia and Amazon had reached an agreement to make HBO Max available on Fire TV and Fire Tablet devices beginning the following day, while also allowing subscribers of HBO via Prime Video Channels access to the HBO Max app at no extra cost (although the additional Max programming will still not be hosted on the Prime Video Channels platform).[188]The dispute with Roku was reported to hinge on carriage commissions and advertising sales on the future ad-supported tier.[184]On December 16, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia and Roku had reached an agreement to make HBO Max available on Roku devices beginning the following day, while also allowing subscribers of HBO via Roku Channels access to the HBO Max app at no extra cost (although the additional Max programming would still not be hosted on the Roku Channels platform); conversely, Roku remote controls from the past five years which included an HBO Now app shortcut button now route viewers directly to the HBO Max app instead.[189]Dish Networkwas also erroneously mentioned as a holdout in some media reports; HBO has not been available at all from Dish since late 2018 due to a separate dispute.[190]On July 29, 2021, WarnerMedia and Dish announced that they had reached an agreement to resolve the dispute and restore HBO to Dish's satellite service, along with offering access to HBO Max to HBO subscribers via Dish at no extra cost.[191]
There were plans for HBO Max to introduce an ad-supported tier by 2021,[192]with AT&T later announcing during their Investor Day event on March 12, 2021, that the tier would launch in June of the same year.[193]HBO original programming will continue to be ad-free for subscribers of the tier, but the tier will not allow access to Same-Day Premieres.[194]WarnerMedia later announced during their 2021 upfront presentation on May 19 that the ad-supported tier would launch during the first week of June at a price point of $9.99 a month.[195]The tier would end up launching on June 3, while also adding a yearly option for both tiers (priced at $99.99 a year for the ad-supported tier and $149.99 a year for the ad-free tier).[196]
Localized versions of HBO Max launched on June 29, 2021, in Latin America and the Caribbean,[197]on October 26, 2021, in Andorra, Spain and the Nordics (excluding Iceland), and on March 8, 2022, in Central and Eastern Europe and Portugal, in part by converting existing streaming services operated by HBO in some of those markets to the HBO Max platform.[198][199]In the interim, some HBO Max original programs have been made available on WarnerMedia's existing international platforms, also includingHBO Asia.[200][201]The European launches of HBO Max featured a notable promotion, offering the service with a 50% discount "for life" for new subscribers as long as they maintain their subscription.[202]
In other countries, HBO and/or Max original programs are licensed tothird-party networks and streaming servicesunder long-term deals. In these cases, Max has left it up to individual rightsholders to decide whether to offer its programming on an over-the-top basis. The extent and lengths of the deals vary by country; not all networks that carry HBO programs also carry Max programs, and in some cases individual programs are carried by different services.[203][204][205]
WarnerMedia said in late 2019 that it planned to continue HBO's existing international licensing partnerships for the time being.[206]However, as part of the WarnerMedia further restructuring announced in August 2020, WarnerMedia presidentJason Kilarsaid HBO Max would be expanding its scope globally.[65]Operations chief Andy Forssell indicated later that year that the company ultimately plans to have HBO Max active in 190 countries, but that a timeline for most of the remaining countries had not been decided.[199]
Following the merger of WarnerMedia with Discovery, Inc. in April 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery has decided to halt international expansion of HBO Max in favor of waiting to replace the existing service, as well as HBO Go in Asia-Pacific region, with Max, and instead continuing to license its content to other international distributors such asSky EuropeandFoxtelin markets where HBO Max isn't available, in an attempt to reach financial stability for the company.[207]This also included postponing the launch of Max in France and Belgium until the summer 2024, despite there already being plans to launch the service as HBO Max in 2023.[208]Plans for expansion of Max are expected to restart sometime in 2026, beginning with the regions where Sky Europe operates,[209]although the service has continued to expand before then, but in the form of an additional VOD hub for existing pay TV operators in countries like New Zealand, Japan and Greece.[210][211][212]
HBO Max was launched on June 29, 2021, in the 39 territories of Latin America and the Caribbean, where HBO already operated directly its streaming service HBO Go, and premium television channels.[213][214]HBO Max in Latin America and the Caribbean was rebranded as Max on February 27, 2024.[215]
Max does not operate in Canada;[216]rights to most Max Original programming produced by Warner Bros. or its subsidiaries are held byBell Media, which distributes them via its OTT serviceCrave, and its English- and French-language pay television servicesCraveandSuper Écran(which themselves include access to the OTT version of Crave viaTV Everywherecredentials). The agreement was first announced in 2019, also renewing Crave's existing rights to first-run HBO programming (Bell operates anHBO channelas a multiplex of Crave) and pay-one rights to Warner Bros. Pictures releases. It does not include the rights to series produced for the service by third-party studios.[203][217][218]The agreement was most recently renewed in 2024 for an unspecified length.[219]
The Bell agreement has excluded some of Max's youth, family, and animation programming, which have often been picked up byCorus Entertainmentfor its specialty channels, such asCartoon Network,Treehouse, andAdult Swim[220](in conjunction with the company's long-standing output agreement withCartoon Network).[221][222][223][224][225]
Under a long-term agreement until 2024 between HBO andSky Group(Comcast), Sky operatesSky Atlanticwhich broadcasts the majority of HBO's programming. Sky Atlantic is available in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy. In February 2011,Sky Atlanticlaunched on the Sky platforms in theUnited KingdomandIreland, which maintains a distribution deal with HBO to offer the majority of its programming on the channel. Under the five-year agreement between HBO and Sky, newer HBO programs will air on Sky Atlantic before airing on other television channels within the United Kingdom and Ireland. Before 2011,TG4in Ireland had a long-term agreement to broadcast HBO programming free-to-air, this ceased following the creation of Sky Atlantic. In many other countries, Max has licensed exclusive rights to its programming to television networks owned by third parties, includingSky Atlanticin theUnited Kingdom.
In March 2021, WarnerMedia confirmed that HBO Max would not launch in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy before 2025 due to an existing deal for HBO programming withSky Groupwhich was renewed in 2019 but does not automatically include Max Originals produced by third-party companies or Warner Bros. Television themselves.[226][227][228]
On December 9, 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery and Sky announced a brand new non-exclusive bundling partnership in the UK and Ireland, where Max is expected to launch in early 2026. Following its launch, Sky customers will gain access to the ad-supported version of Max at no additional cost.[229]
On August 15, 2012, HBO announced plans to launchHBO Nordic, a multiplatform video distribution service servingNorway,Denmark,SwedenandFinlandthat was created through a joint venture with Parsifal International.[230][231]Thevideo on demandservice launched in December 2012.[232]HBO programming also airs inIcelandonStöð 2.[233]In Spain, HBO programs were previously broadcast on pay television serviceCanal+, since 2011.[234]In 2016, during the discontinuation of the Canal+ branding in Spain, HBO launched a standalone streaming service called HBO España, which was the Spanish equivalent of HBO Now and HBO Nordic.
HBO Europehad announced on multiple occasions that they were not aware that they were going to replace their current service with HBO Max, nor would their rates be increased.[235]However, in December 2020, the head of HBO Max, Andy Forssell, revealed that all HBO services in Europe, including HBO España and HBO Nordic, would be replaced by HBO Max. On October 26, 2021, HBO Max was launched in the Nordics (excluding Iceland) and Spain and Andorra.[236][237]
Starting in 2024, HBO Max's programming began to be integrated as part of more expensive packages in the Spanish TV service Movistar Plus+ with all programming from the service becoming available on Movistar Plus+ by April 2024.[238][239]The rebranding to Max went into effect on May 21, 2024.[240][241]On September 17, 2024, a linear TV channel dedicated to broadcasting HBO and Max content was launched, exclusively on Movistar Plus+, as Max Avances.[242]
In the 2010s,HBO Europelaunched streaming serviceHBO Goin 13Central and Eastern Europeancountries. HBO programs in Portugal were previously broadcast on the premium television channel TVSéries from the services ofTVCine, since 2015. In 2019, less than a year before the discontinuation of TVSeries, HBO Europe launched a standalone streaming service called HBO Portugal. Similarly to the Nordics and Spain, HBO Max was launched in Portugal[243]and Central and Eastern Europe on March 8, 2022,[244]replacing HBO Portugal and HBO Go.

The HBO catalog was also available to stream on their streaming service. From 2019 to 2023, OCS had the complete exclusivity on the HBO catalog in France. Before that, other channels likeCanal+,Canal+ SériesorNT1could aired reruns of selected HBO series after their original run on OCS.[246]However, OCS didn't have the rights on the Max catalogue. The deal ended in December 2022, with HBO productions leaving OCS from January 2023 onwards.[247]
In October 2021, formerCanal+executive Vera Peltekian was appointed as VP and commissioning editor of original HBO Max programming forFrance. HBO Max's launch in France was set for 2023, but this ended up getting delayed after Warner Bros. Discovery decided to halt the global rollout of HBO Max to replace the existing service with Max first.[208]Meanwhile,Canal+, theTF1 Group, andWarner TVbroadcast a selection of the Warner Bros.-produced scripted live-action Max Original series, certain films and reunion specials.

Discovery and U-Next was renewed in March 2023, making the streaming service the home of HBO content in the country in a "multi-year" deal between the two. On September 18, 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery signed an exclusive partnership agreement with U-Next. The deal will allow Max to launch within the U-Next system featuring a library of more than 2,500 works and 16,000 episodes from 8 brands including HBO, Max Originals,Harry Potter, DC, Warner Bros., Cartoon Network, Discovery Channel, and Animal Planet. It officially launched on September 25, 2024 at 2:00 p.m.[211][280]
OSNcurrently carries HBO content across 22 countries in the Middle East and North Africa region on its linear channels as well as itsOSN+streaming service. An exclusive, multi-year licensing deal was renewed in March 2023, meaning a Max launch is unlikely in this region in the near future.
HBO Max received mixed reception from media observers on launch. The range of available content was generally well received, but many commented on the likelihood of confusion with HBO's other since-deprecated streaming platforms, HBO Go and HBO Now, and the service's higher subscription price compared to other newly launched streaming platforms likeDisney+.[75][309][310]Television critics also expressed frustration that thelibrary of original series(not including its former late night adult content) for sister network Cinemax was not originally available on HBO Max, though much of its output had arrived on the service by the end of 2021.[311]
AT&T announced in July 2020 that HBO Max had nominally achieved 26.6 million subscribers after its first month of operation, including 23.6 million wholesale customers, primarily legacy HBO pay TV subscribers that were covered by new agreements that added access to HBO Max at no extra charge.[312]However, only 4.1 million customers had activated their HBO Max accounts by the same date.[312]The latter figure was seen by many observers as a disappointment, particularly in light of Disney+ having reached 10 million subscribers within a day of launch;The New York Times's media criticBen Smithwrote that WarnerMedia had "badly botched" the launch.[313]
However, AT&T executives contended that it had been a "flawless launch" citing increased customer engagement compared to HBO Now and overall growth in total subscriptions to either HBO or HBO Max (36.3 million, vs. 34.6 million HBO or HBO Now subscribers at the end of 2019), while acknowledging that there was more to do to persuade existing HBO subscribers to start using the HBO Max apps.[314]Executives had previously noted that HBO Max was starting from a different place than other streaming services as it was building on the existing HBO subscriber base, and had to work within the constraints of many of HBO's pre-existing deals (such as those with Amazon and Roku).[315]
In October 2020, AT&T revealed that the number of activated HBO Max subscribers had reached 8.6 million by the end of September, while the number of nominal (eligible) subscribers reached 28.7 million. The total number of HBO / HBO Max subscriptions in the U.S. also increased to 28 million.[316]With an agreement being reached the following month with Amazon (which is reported to have had 5 million HBO subscribers through Prime Video Channels), the number of HBO Max-eligible subscribers is understood to have increased to over 33 million.[188]In September 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery was sued by a shareholder, alleging that WarnerMedia had overstated the number of HBO Max subscribers by including unactivated subscriptions bundled with AT&T services.[317][318]
Upon its launch, it was noted that Max had grouped directors and writers for its films and television series under a singular "creators" credit.[319]TheDirectors Guild of AmericaandWriters Guild of America Westcondemned the move amidst the2023 Hollywood labor disputes. Max announced that they would fix the credits, agreeing with the outcry from the guilds regarding proper credit for its creators, noting the altered credits were a result of "an oversight in the technical transition" from HBO Max to Max.[320]Deadline Hollywoodreported the consolidation was a result of WBD's IT departments creating the "catch all" for the credits to be in place for launch, and that executives, who could have intervened, had been unaware of the single credit until the discourse arose online after its launch. Additionally, it was reported that it would take "weeks" to fix, given the service would need to make the adjustment on each platform.[321]The credits would later be fixed, beginning in late June.[322]

Steven Andrew Soderbergh(/ˈsoʊdərˌbɜːrɡ/SOH-dər-burg; born January 14, 1963)[1]is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, cinematographer, and editor. A pioneer of modernindependent cinema, Soderbergh later drew acclaim for formally inventive films made within thestudio system.
Soderbergh's directorial breakthrough, the indie dramaSex, Lies, and Videotape(1989), lifted him into the public spotlight as a notable presence in the film industry. At 26, Soderbergh became the youngest solo director to win thePalme d'Orat theCannes Film Festival, and the film garnered worldwide commercial success, as well asnumerous accolades. His next five films, including the critically laudedKing of the Hill(1993), found limited commercial success. He pivoted into more mainstream fare with the crime comedyOut of Sight(1998), the biopicErin Brockovich(2000) and the crime dramaTraffic(2000). ForTraffic, he won theAcademy Award for Best Director.
Soderbergh found further popular and critical success with theOcean'strilogy and film franchise(2001–18),Che(2008),The Informant!(2009),Contagion(2011),Haywire(2011), theMagic Miketrilogy (2012-23),Side Effects(2013),Behind the Candelabra(2013),Logan Lucky(2017),Unsane(2018),Let Them All Talk(2020),No Sudden Move(2021), andKimi(2022). His film career spans a multitude of genres but his specialties arepsychological,crime, andheist films. His films have grossed over US$2.2 billion worldwide and garnered fourteenAcademy Awardnominations, winning five.
Soderbergh's films often revolve around familiar concepts which are regularly used for big-budget Hollywood movies, but he routinely employs anavant-gardearthouseapproach. They center on themes of shiftingpersonal identities, vengeance,sexuality, morality, and thehuman condition. His feature films are often distinctive in the realm ofcinematographyas a result of his having been influenced byavant-garde cinema, coupled with his use of unconventionalfilmandcamera formats. Many of Soderbergh's films are anchored by multi-dimensional storylines withplot twists,nonlinear storytelling,experimental sequencing, suspensefulsoundscapes, and third-person vantage points.
Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, inAtlanta, Georgia, to Mary Ann (néeBernard) and Peter Andrew Soderbergh, who was a university administrator and educator. Soderbergh hasSwedish,Irish, andItalianroots.[2]His paternal grandfather immigrated to the U.S. fromStockholm.[3]
As a child, he moved with his family toCharlottesville, Virginia, where he lived during his adolescence, and then toBaton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father became Dean of Education atLouisiana State University(LSU).[2]Soderbergh discovered filmmaking as a teenager and directed short films with aSuper 8and16 mm cameras.[4]He attended theLouisiana State University Laboratory Schoolfor high school before graduating and moving toHollywoodto pursue professional filmmaking.
In his first job, he worked as a game showcomposerand cue card holder; soon after which he found work as a freelance film editor. During this time, he directed the concert video9012Livefor the rock bandYesin 1985, for which he received aGrammy Awardnomination forBest Music Video, Long Form.[5]
After Soderbergh returned to Baton Rouge, he wrote the screenplay forSex, Lies, and Videotapeon alegal padduring an eight-day cross-country drive.[6]The film tells the story of a troubled man who videotapes women discussing their lives and sexuality, and his impact on the relationship of a married couple.[7]Soderbergh submittedSex, Lies, and Videotapeto the1989 Cannes Film Festivalwhere, at age 26, he became the youngest solo director to win thePalme d'Or, the top prize.[8][9]Its critical performance led it to become a worldwide commercial success, grossing $36.7 million on a $1.2 million budget.[10]
Sex, Lies, and Videotapeis considered to be the most influential catalyst of the 1990sIndependent Cinemamovement.[11][12]Film criticRoger Ebertcalled Soderbergh the "poster boyof theSundancegeneration".[13]His relative youth and sudden rise to prominence in the film industry had him referred to as a "sensation" and a prodigy.[14][15]In 2006,Sex, Lies, and Videotapewas selected by theLibrary of Congressfor preservation in the United StatesNational Film Registry, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and theAmerican Film Institutenominated it as one of the greatest movies ever made.[16][17]
When I say this is the most important motion picture you'll ever attend, my motivation is not financial gain, but a firm belief that the delicate fabric that holds all of us together will be ripped apart unless every man, woman, and child in this country sees this film and pays full ticket price, not some bargainmatinéecut-rate deal.
Soderbergh's directorial debut was followed by a series of low-budget box-office disappointments.[18][19]In 1991, he directedKafka,a biographical film ofFranz Kafkawritten byLem Dobbsand starringJeremy Irons. The film returned one tenth of its budget and received mixed reviews from critics.[20]Roger Ebert's review stated: "Soderbergh does demonstrate again here that he's a gifted director, however unwise in his choice of project".[21]Two years later, he directed the dramaKing of the Hill(1993), which again underperformed commercially, but fared well with critics.[22]Based on the memoir of writerA. E. Hotchner, the film is set during theGreat Depressionand follows a young boy (played byJesse Bradford) struggling to survive on his own in a hotel inSt. Louisafter his mother falls ill and his father is away on business trips.[23]Also in 1995, he directed a remake ofRobert Siodmak's 1949 film noirCriss Cross, titledThe Underneath, which grossed $536,020 on a $6.5 million budget and was widely panned by critics.[24]Soderbergh has since called the film "dead on arrival" and described the making of it as his bottoming out.[25]
Soderbergh, formerly a member ofWriters Guild of America West, left and maintainedfinancial corestatus in 1995.[26]
Soderbergh directedSchizopolisin 1996, a comedy which he starred in, wrote, composed and shot as well as directed. The film was submitted to theCannes Film Festivalto such a "chilly response" that he reworked the entire introduction and conclusion before releasing it commercially.[27]In the movie's introduction, he said: "In the event that you find certain sequences or events confusing, please bear in mind this is your fault, not ours. You will need to see the picture again and again until you understand everything".[28]He starred inSchizopolisas Fletcher Munson, a spokesman for aScientology-esque lifestyle cult, and again as Dr. Jeffrey Korchek, a dentist having an affair with Munson's wife.[28]The film switched languages multiple times mid-scene without subtitles, leaving large parts of it incomprehensible.[28]It was viewed by a critic as a "directorial palate cleanse" for Soderbergh.[29]During the months following his debut ofSchizopolis, he released a small, edited version of theSpalding Graymonologue filmGray's Anatomy.Soderbergh would later refer toSchizopolisas his "artistic wake-up call".[28]Soderbergh co-wrote the script for the 1997 horror-thrillerNightwatchwith Danish filmmakerOle Bornedal.Nightwatchis an English-language remake of Bornedal's ownfilm of the same name, which was produced three years earlier in Denmark.[30]
Soderbergh's reemergence began in 1998 withOut of Sight, a stylized adaptation of anElmore Leonardnovel, written byScott Frankand starringGeorge ClooneyandJennifer Lopez.[31]The film was widely praised, though only a moderate box-office success.[32]The critical reception of the movie began a multi-movie artistic partnership between Clooney and Soderbergh. Soderbergh followed up on the success ofOut of Sightby making another crime caper,The Limey(1999), from a screenplay byLem Dobbsand starring actorsTerence StampandPeter Fonda. The film was well-received and established him within thecinematic nicheof thriller and heist films.[33]He ventured into his first biographical film in 2000 when he directedErin Brockovich, written bySusannah Grantand starringJulia Robertsin herOscar-winning role as a single mother taking on industry in a civil action.[34]In late 2000, Soderbergh releasedTraffic, a social drama written byStephen Gaghanand featuring an ensemble cast.[35]Timecompared him to a baseball player hittinghome runswithErin BrockovichandTraffic.[35]Both films would be nominated at the2001 Academy Awards, making him the first director to have been nominated in the same year forBest Directorfor two different films since Michael Curtiz in 1938. He was awarded theAcademy Award for Best DirectorforTrafficand received best director nominations at the year'sGolden Globeand theDirectors Guild of AmericaAwards.[36][37]
In early 2001, he was approached to directOcean's Eleven, a reboot of the 1960sRat Pack-movieOcean's 11written byTed Griffin. After Griffin wrote the screenplay, Soderbergh signed on to direct. The film opened to critical acclaim and widespread commercial success.[38]It quickly became Soderbergh's highest-grossing movie to date, grossing more than $183 million domestically and more than $450 million worldwide.[39][40]Rolling Stonecredited the movie with "[spawning] a new era of heist movies".[38]In the same year, Soderbergh madeFull Frontal, which was shot mostly on digital video in an improvisational style that deliberately blurred the line between which actors were playing characters and which were playing fictionalized versions of themselves.[41]A year later, he was asked by executives atWarner BrosStudios to direct the psychological thrillerInsomnia(2002), starring Academy Award winnersAl Pacino,Robin Williams, andHilary Swank. Despite their insistence, Soderbergh declined, preferring to see it directed by up-and-coming directorChristopher Nolan.[42]
Before returning to theOcean'sseries, Soderbergh directedK Street(2003), a ten-part politicalHBOseries he co-produced with George Clooney.[43]The series was both partially improvised and each episode being produced in the five days prior to airing to take advantage of topical events that could be worked into the fictional narrative.[44]Actual political players appeared as themselves, either incameosor portraying fictionalized versions of themselves, notablyJames CarvilleandMary Matalin.[44]
The reason my career took such a left turn at a certain point was because I realized I was in danger of becoming aformalist. But that wasn't the best representation of me–even as a person. It's easy to fall into that because it's a very isolated position to occupy and it's easy to keep other elements–people and ideas–at a distance.
Soderbergh directedOcean's Twelve, a sequel toOcean's Eleven, in 2004. The second installment received muted critical reviews, and was another commercially successful film, grossing $362.7 million on a $110 million budget.[46]Matt Singer ofIndieWirecalled it a "Great Sequel About How Hard It Is to Make a Great Sequel."[47][48]Also in 2004, Soderbergh produced and co-wrote the adapted screenplay for the filmCriminal—a remake of the Argentine filmNine Queens—with his longtime assistant directorGregory Jacobs, who made his directorial debut with the film.[49]
A year later, Soderbergh directedBubble(2005), a $1.6 million film featuring a cast of nonprofessional actors. It opened in selected theaters andHDNetsimultaneously, and four days later onDVD. Industry heads were reportedly watching how the film performed, as its unusual release schedule could have implications for future feature films.[50][51]Theater-owners, who at the time had been suffering from dropping attendance rates, did not welcome so-called "day-and-date" movies.[52]National Association of Theatre Ownerschief executive John Fithian indirectly called the film's release model "the biggest threat to the viability of thecinema industrytoday."[53]Soderbergh's response to such criticism: "I don't think it's going to destroy the movie-going experience any more than the ability to get takeout has destroyed the restaurant business."[54]A romantic drama set in post-war Berlin,The Good German, starringCate Blanchettand Clooney, was released in late 2006. The film performed poorly commercially grossing $5.9 million worldwide against a budget of $32 million.[55]
Soderbergh next directedOcean's Thirteen, which was released in June 2007 to further commercial success and increased critical acclaim.[56]Grossing $311.3 million on an $85 million budget, it is the second highest-grossing film of his career after the firstOcean's.[57]The film concluded what would later be known as theOcean'strilogy, a collection of heist movies that would go on to be described as defining a new era of heist films.[58]Soderbergh directedChe, which was released in theaters in two parts, titledThe ArgentineandGuerrilla, and was presented in the main competition of the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, on May 22.Benicio del Toroplayed the Argentine guerrillaErnesto "Che" Guevarain an epic four-hour double bill which looks first at his role in theCuban Revolutionbefore moving to his campaign and eventual death in Bolivia.[59]Soderbergh shot his feature filmThe Girlfriend Experiencein New York in 2008. Soderbergh cast adult film starSasha Greyas the film's lead actress to great reception and controversy.[60][61]

Whitacre wore a wire for2+1⁄2years for theFBIas a high-level executive at aFortune 500company,Archer Daniels Midland(ADM), in one of the largestprice-fixingcases in history. The film was released on September 18, 2009. The script for the movie was written by Scott Z. Burns based onKurt Eichenwald's book,The Informant. The film grossed $41 million on a $22 million budget and received generally favorable reviews from critics.[62][63]Also in 2009, Soderbergh shot a small improvised film with the cast of the play,The Last Time I Saw Michael Gregg, a comedy about a theatre company staging Chekhov'sThree Sisters. He has stated that he does not want it seen by the public, and only intended it for the cast. Soderbergh nearly filmed a feature adaptation of the baseball bookMoneyball, starringBrad PittandJonah Hill. The book, byMichael Lewis, tells of howBilly Beane, general manager ofOakland Athletics, usedstatistical analysisto make up for what he lacked in funds to beat the odds and lead his team to a series of notable wins in 2002. Disagreements between Sony and Soderbergh about revisions toSteven Zaillian's version of the screenplay led to Soderbergh's dismissal from the project only days prior to filming in June 2009. In 2010, Soderbergh shot the action-thrillerHaywire, starringGina Carano,Ewan McGregor,Michael FassbenderandChanning Tatumwhich, even though was shot in early 2010, was not released until January 2012.[64]
In 2010, Soderbergh shot the epic virus thrillerContagion, written byScott Z. Burns.[65]With a cast includingMatt Damon,Kate Winslet,Gwyneth Paltrow,Laurence Fishburne,Marion CotillardandJude Law, the film follows the outbreak of a lethalpandemicacross the globe and the efforts of doctors and scientists to discover the cause and develop a cure. Soderbergh premiered it at the68th Venice Film Festivalin Venice, Italy on September 3, 2011, and released it to the general public six days later to commercial success andwidespread critical acclaim.[66]Grossing $135.5 million on a $60 million budget,Manohla DargisofThe New York Timescalled his film a "smart, spooky thriller about a thicket of contemporary plagues—a killer virus, rampaging fear, an unscrupulous blogger—is as ruthlessly effective as the malady at its cool, cool center."[67]
In August 2011, Soderbergh served as asecond unit directoronThe Hunger Gamesand filmed much of the District 11 riot scene.[68][69]In September and October 2011, he shotMagic Mike, a film starringChanning Tatum, about the actor's experiences working as a male stripper in his youth. Tatum played the title mentor character, whileAlex Pettyferplayed a character based on Tatum. The film was released on June 29, 2012, to a strong commercial performance and favorable critical acclaim.[70]Throughout 2012, Soderbergh had announced his intention to retire from feature filmmaking. He stated that "when you reach the point where you're saying, 'If I have to get into a van to do another scout, I'm just going to shoot myself,' it's time to let somebody who's still excited about getting in the van, get in the van."[71]Soderbergh later said that he would retire from filmmaking and begin to explore painting.[72]A few weeks later, Soderbergh played down his earlier comments, saying a filmmaking "sabbatical" was more accurate.[73]For his then-final feature film, he directed the psychological thrillerSide Effects, which starredJude Law,Rooney Mara,Channing TatumandCatherine Zeta-Jones. It was shot in April 2012 and was released on February 8, 2013.[74]Screened at the63rd Berlin International Film Festival,A. O. ScottofThe New York Timesstated that Soderbergh "[handled] it brilliantly, serving notice once again that he is a crackerjack genre technician."[75]In the end, while promotingSide Effectsin early 2013, he clarified that he had a five-year plan that saw him transitioning away from making feature films around his fiftieth birthday.[76]Around that time, he gave a much publicized speech at theSan Francisco International Film Festival, detailing the obstacles facing filmmakers in the current corporate Hollywood environment.[77]

His final televised project before heading into retirement wasBehind the Candelabra. Shot in the summer of 2012, it starredMichael Douglasas legendarily flamboyant pianistLiberaceandMatt Damonas his loverScott Thorson. The film is written byRichard LaGravenese, based on Thorson's bookBehind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace, and produced byHBO Films.[80]It was selected to compete for thePalme d'Orat the2013 Cannes Film Festival.[81]
In May 2013—only months into his retirement—Soderbergh announced that he would direct a ten-part miniseries forCinemaxcalledThe Knick. The series followed doctors at a fictionalized version of theKnickerbocker Hospitalin Manhattan in the early twentieth century. The series starredClive Owen,Andre Holland,Jeremy Bobb,Juliet Rylance,Eve HewsonandMichael Angaranoand was filmed in 2013.[82]It began airing in August 2014 to critical acclaim.[83]After completing the second season, Soderbergh revealed he was finished directing for the show, and said: "I told them [Cinemax] that I'm going to do the first two years and then we are going to break out the story for seasons 3 and 4 and try and find a filmmaker or filmmakers to do this the way that I did. This is how we want to do this so that every two years, whoever comes on, has the freedom to create their universe."[84]

Soderbergh's visual style often emphasizes wealthy urban settings, natural lighting, and fast-paced working environments.[8][2][130]Film critic Drew Morton has categorized his stylistic approach to films akin to theFrench New Wavemovement in filmmaking.[131][132]Soderbergh's experimental style and tendency to rejectmainstream film standardsstems from his belief that "[filmmakers] are always, in essence, at the beginning of infinity... there is always another iteration... always will be."[133]
On a technical level, Soderbergh prefers sustainedclose-ups,tracking shots,jump cuts, experimental sequencing and frequently skipsestablishing shotsin favor of audio and alternative visuals.[8]Many of his films are noted for a milieu of suspense through the usage ofthird-personvantage points and a variety ofover-the-shoulder shots. In his filmContagion(2011), he used amulti-narrative "hyperlink cinema" style, first established withintheOcean'strilogy.[134]He is known for tracking aesthetic transitions with a variety ofcolored washes, most notably yellow to symbolize open, socially acceptable situations while blue washes typically symbolize illegal or socially illicit endeavors.[135]In line with these washes, Soderbergh is liberal in his usage ofmontagesas he believes that they are equally important story-telling as dialogue.[136]
Soderbergh is known for having a combative relationship withHollywoodand the standards ofstudio filmmaking.[2]Film criticRoger Eberthas commented in this stylistic antagonism, "Every once in a while, perhaps as an exercise in humility, Steven Soderbergh makes a truly inexplicable film... A film so amateurish that only the professionalism of some of the actors makes it watchable... It's the kind of film where you need the director telling you what he meant to do and what went wrong and how the actors screwed up and how there was no money for retakes, etc."[137]
InOcean's Twelve(2004), he had actressJulia Robertsplay the part of Tess, a character then forced to play a fictionalized version of Roberts.[138]During the production stages ofThe Girlfriend Experience(2009) he cast adult film starSasha Greyin the lead role.[138]InHaywire(2011), Soderbergh cast and eventually launched the film career of professionalmixed martial arts(MMA) fighterGina Carano.[139]Soderbergh'sLogan Lucky(2017) made reference to his trilogy by alluding to an "Ocean's7–11", noting the trilogy's influence on the Southern heist film.[138]
Soderbergh's films are centered on suspenseful and ambientsoundscapes.[140]A primary way he achieves suspenseful soundscapes is by introducing audio before visuals in cut scenes, alerting the viewer of a sudden change in tone.[140]His frequent collaborations with composersCliff Martinez,David Holmes, and most recentlyThomas Newman, provide his films with "the thematic and sonic landscapes into which he inserts his characters."[44]
The simplest way that I can describe it is that a movie is something you see, andcinemais something that's made…. Cinema is a specificity of vision. It's an approach in which everything matters. It's the polar opposite of generic or arbitrary and the result is as unique as a signature or a fingerprint. It isn't made by a committee, and it isn't made by a company, and it isn't made by the audience.
Soderbergh's early films—on account of his youth and lack of resources—were primarily filmed onSuper 8and16 mm filmformats.[142]A variety of his feature films have been shot using a diverse range of camera equipment. He filmed all ofThe Girlfriend Experience(2009) on aRed Onecamera, which has retailed for $17,500[143]—a relatively inexpensive camera for a movie produced for $1.3 million.[144]Soderbergh filmed the entirety ofUnsane(2018) on aniPhone 7 Pluswith its4K digital camerausing the app FiLMiC Pro.[145]He filmed with three rotating iPhones using aDJI stabiliserto hold the phone in place.[146]In January 2018, he expressed an interest in filming other productions solely with iPhones going forward.[147]He then filmed the entirety of 2019'sHigh Flying Birdon aniPhone 8.[148]
In addition to his directing, he is frequently a screenwriter for his films. Scott Tobias ofThe A. V. Clubhas noted his method ofexperimental filmmakingas "rigorously conceived, like a mathematician working out a byzantine equation". Starting in 2000 with his filmTraffic, when directing films Soderbergh has used various pseudonyms in order to hide the fact that he edits, writes, and arranges.[149]
When working with actors, Soderbergh prefers to pursue a non-intrusive directorial style. "I try and make sure they're OK, and when they're in the zone, I leave them alone. I don't get in their way".[150]This method has attracted repeat performances by many high-profile movie stars which has established a reoccurring collaboration between them and Soderbergh.[150]
Soderbergh's films often center the themes of shiftingpersonal identities,sexuality, and thehuman condition.[151]Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkerstated that Soderbergh is focused on the process of presenting ideas through film rather than their actual realization.[151]In line with this actual realization, he presents themes to critically evaluate political and corporate institutions such as money andcapitalism.[152]Film criticA. O. Scotthas noted that Soderbergh has a critical interest in exploring the impact capitalist economies have on living an ethical life and the detractions associated withmaterialism.[153]Money is central to many of his movies as Soderbergh believes that it serves as an obsession unrivaled by any other.[153]
Starting withOut of Sight(1998), Soderbergh's heist films explore themes of vengeance, characters on a mission, and the morality of crime.[154]He is generally said to have acinematic nichein these types of films. "I've always had an attraction to caper movies, and certainly there are analogies to making a film. You have to put the right crew together, and if you lose, you go to movie jail", the director noted in 2017.[155]
When asked about the top eleven films he regarded among the best, Soderbergh listed the following, in order:The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.(1953),All The President's Men(1976),Annie Hall(1977),Citizen Kane(1941),The Conversation(1974),The Godfather(1972),The Godfather Part II(1974),Jaws(1975),The Last Picture Show(1971),Sunset Boulevard(1950) andThe Third Man(1949).[156]His directorial debut,Sex, Lies, and Videotape(1989), was influenced byMike Nichols' 1971 American comedy-dramaCarnal Knowledge.[157]He has said thatPeter Yates' 1972 crime-comedyThe Hot Rockinspired the tone of theOcean'sfilms.[158]Soderbergh listedCosta-Gavras's film,Zas an inspiration on his filmTrafficand even stated that he: "wanted to make it like [Costa-Gavras]'sZ".[159][160][161][162]Soderbergh also cites the Swiss-French directorJean-Luc Godardas "...a constant source of inspiration. Before I do anything, I go back and look at as many of his films as I can, as a reminder of what's possible".[163]
In 2018, Soderbergh launched aBoliviangrape spirit brand called "Singani 63". In 2014, he had teamed up with adistillerybased inTarija, Casa Real and became the sole exporter of the spirit from the mountains of Bolivia.[164][165]Singaniis a traditional spirit of Bolivia, and Soderbergh doesn't like to label singani abrandy, because he says, "Millennials hate brandy." To demonstrate this, he created a very short iPhone/YouTube video, "Brandy VS Singani 63", that asks people to give their thoughts regarding brandy and Singani 63.[166]
Soderbergh has worked with various actors, composers, and screenwriters throughout his filmmaking career. His most prolific collaborators are considered to beGeorge Clooney(who startedSection Eight Productionswith him and has appeared in six of his films),Matt Damon(his most frequent collaborator, who has appeared in nine of his films),Brad Pitt,Julia Roberts,Don Cheadle, andChanning Tatum. Other actors who have appeared in numerous Soderbergh films includeLuis Guzmán,Jude Law,Ann Dowd,Joe Chrest,[167]Benicio Del Toro,Catherine Zeta-Jones,Michael DouglasandAlbert Finney.[168]Among those who have won awards for their work with Soderbergh, Roberts won anAcademy Award for Best Actressfor her lead inErin Brockovich;Benicio del Toroalso won an Academy Award for his work inTraffic, and later starred as the title role inChe.Catherine Zeta-Jonesreceived aGolden Globenomination for her portrayal of Helena inTrafficand reteamed with him forOcean's TwelveandSide Effects.[168]
Soderbergh has frequently relied onJerry Weintraubto produce many of his films.[169]ComposerCliff Martinezhas scored eleven Soderbergh films starting withSex, Lies, and Videotape(1989) and ending withKimi(2022). Northern Irish composerDavid Holmesjoined him in 1998 to scoreOut of Sightand rejoined him in scoring hisOcean'strilogy.[170]Soderbergh rejected Holmes' score for his 2006 filmThe Good German, but brought him back for subsequent movies, most recentlyLogan Lucky(2017).[170][171]Starting in 2000, composerThomas Newmanhas worked with four Soderbergh films, most recently in 2020 withLet Them All Talk.[172]Often editing the films himself, he also works with editorStephen Mirrioneand frequently collaborates with screenwritersScott Z. Burns,Lem DobbsandEd Solomon.[173]
Soderbergh is a vocal proponent of the preservation of artistic merit in the face of Hollywood corporatism. He believes that "cinemais under assault by the studios and, from what I can tell, with the full support of the audience".[151]He claims that he no longer reads reviews of his movies. "AfterTrafficI just stopped completely", said the director.[174]"After winning the LA and New York film critics awards, I really felt like, this can only get worse".[174]
Soderbergh is not a fan ofpossessory credits, and prefers not to have his name front and center at the start of a film. "The fact that I'm not an identifiable brand is very freeing," says Soderbergh, "because people get tired of brands and they switch brands. I've never had a desire to be out in front of anything, which is why I don't take a possessory credit."[174]He often takes cinematography credits on his feature films under the alias Peter Andrews, the given name of his father, and editing credits under Mary Ann Bernard, that of his mother.
In 2009, Soderbergh appeared before theU.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and "cited the French initiative in asking lawmakers to deputize the American film industry to pursue copyright pirates," indicating he supports anti-piracy laws and Internet regulation.[175]
Soderbergh married actressBetsy Brantleyin 1989; the couple had a daughter together before their 1994 divorce.[19]He has been married toJules Asnersince 2003, whom he often credits for influencing his female characters.[176]He has a daughter, born in 2010, with a woman in Australia, where he was working during a separation from Asner.[177]Soderbergh lives in New York City.[178]His 2023 web seriesCommand Zwas filmed inside his own home.[179]
In 2009, Soderbergh signed a petition in support of film directorRoman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his1977 sexual abuse case.[180]
Soderbergh's entire filmography isroutinely analyzed and debatedby fans, critics,film academics, and other film directors.[141][181]His early work—particularly his 1989 film,Sex, Lies, and Videotape—has been noted as foundational to theIndependent Cinemamovement.[25][182][183]After directing his first film, Soderbergh's relative youth and sudden rise to prominence in the film industry had him referred to as a "sensation", aprodigy, and aposter boyof the genre's generation.[13][14]In 2002, he was elected first Vice President of theDirectors Guild of America.[184]
After screeningSex, Lies, and Videotapeat the 1989Cannes Film Festival, Soderbergh was given the festival's top award, thePalme d'Or.[8]At 26, he was the youngest solo director to win the award and second-youngest director after French directorsLouis Malleand co-directorJacques Cousteau(Malle won it aged 23).[9]For his script, Soderbergh received a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplayat the62nd Academy Awards.[185]
Soderbergh was nominated twice forBest Directorfor two separate films at the73rd Academy Awards, the first occurrence of such an event since 1938. Apart from his first nomination (Erin Brockovich), he won the award forTraffic.[37]When the same thing happened at theDirectors Guild of AmericaAwards, theAssociated Presscalled the category a "Soderbergh vs. Soderbergh" contest.[36]
For his work ofErin BrockovichandTraffic, Soderbergh became one of the five directors (alongsideQuentin Tarantino,Curtis Hanson,David Fincher, andBarry Jenkins) to ever sweep "The Big Four" critics awards (LAFCA,NBR,NYFCC,NSFC).

Bergen's paternal grandparents were Swedish immigrants whoanglicizedtheir surname, which was originally Berggren ("mountain branch").
Bergen was raised inBeverly Hills, California, and attended theWestlake School for Girls.[4]As a child, she was irritated when described as "Charlie McCarthy's little sister" (a reference to her father's stardummy).[5]She began appearing on her father's radio program at a young age[6]and in 1958, at age 11, was a guest with her father onGroucho Marx's quiz showYou Bet Your Life, as Candy Bergen. She said she wanted to be a clothing designer when she grew up.
She later attended theUniversity of Pennsylvania, where she was electedHomecoming Queenand Miss University but, as Bergen later acknowledged, she did not take her education seriously.

Before taking up acting, Bergen was a fashion model and was featured onVoguecovers. She received acting training atHB Studio[8]in New York City.
Bergen made her screen debut playing a university student in theensemble filmThe Group(1966), directed bySidney Lumet, who knew Bergen's family.

It was made for20th Century Fox.[10]

She played a frustrated socialite in a 1970 political satire,The Adventurers, based on a novel byHarold Robbins. Her salary was $200,000.[12]The film received negative reviews, and while it did respectably at the box office, it did not help her career.[13]Bergen called it a "movie out of the 1940s."[14]
Bergen playedElliott Gould's girlfriend inGetting Straight(1970), a counterculture movie which drew another spate of bad reviews but was commercially profitable. She said it took her career in "a new direction... my first experience with democratic, communal movie making."[14]
She also starred in the controversial WesternSoldier Blue(1970), an overseas success but a failure in America. The film's European success led to Bergen's being voted by British exhibitors as the seventh-most popular star at the British box office in 1971.[15]Bergen appeared withOliver ReedandGene HackmaninThe Hunting Party(1971), a violent Western which drew terrible reviews and flopped.
Bergen received some strong reviews for her supporting role inCarnal Knowledge(1971), directed byMike Nichols. She then had the lead role in the dramaT.R. Baskin(1971) and earned the best reviews of her career up to that time. She described the latter as the first role "that is really sort of a vehicle, where I have to act and not just be a sort of decoration" saying she had decided "it was time for me to get serious about acting."[14]
Bergen was absent from screens for a few years. She returned with a supporting part in a British heist film,11 Harrowhouse(1974), then did a Western withGene HackmanandJames Coburn,Bite the Bullet(1975). Both films were modest successes. In 1975, she replacedFaye Dunawayat the last minute to co-star withSean ConneryinThe Wind and the Lion(1976), as a strong-willed American widow kidnapped in the Moroccan desert. The film drew mixed reviews and broke even at the box office.

In 1988, she took the lead role in the sitcomMurphy Brown, in which she played a tough television reporter. This provided her with the opportunity to show her little-seen comic talent. The series made frequent reference to politicians and political issues of the day; though it was primarily a conventional sitcom, the show tackled important issues. For example, Brown was a recoveringalcoholicwho became a single mother and later battledbreast cancer.
In 1992,Vice PresidentDan Quaylecriticized prime-time TV for showing the Murphy Brown character "mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice."[21]Quayle's disparaging remarks were subsequently written into the show, with Brown shown watching Quayle's speech in disbelief at his insensitivity and ignorance of the reality of the lives of single mothers. A subsequent episode explored the subject of family values within a diverse set of families. The Brown character arranges for a truckload ofpotatoesto be dumped in front of Quayle's residence, an allusion to an infamous incident in which Quayle erroneously directed a school child to spell the word "potato" as "potatoe".
In reality, Bergen agreed with at least some of Quayle's observations, saying that while the particular remark was "an arrogant and uninformed posture", as a whole, it was "a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did."[22]
Bergen's run onMurphy Brownwas extremely successful. The show ran for ten seasons; between 1989 and 1998, Bergen was nominated for anEmmy Awardseven times and won five. After her fifth win, she declined future nominations for the role.[23]

Bergen's father died in 1978. In her memoirA Fine Romance, she mentions that she was left out of his will, while he bequeathed $10,000 to his dummy, Charlie McCarthy, adding that she felt her father had a stronger bond with Charlie than with her.[43]She later said:
His death left a space for me [...] I was able much more to live according to my own expectations.  I always felt my fame was ill-gotten, sort of borrowed from his, and that perhaps I tried to keep some kind of rein on it.  Even when he was in retirement I felt I was poaching on his territory.  He'd joke and say he was 'the father of Candice Bergen,' and that was only partially a joke.  It was very hard on him.[44]
On September 27, 1980, she married French film directorLouis Malle. They had one child, a daughter named Chloe Françoise, in 1985. The couple were married until Malle's death fromcanceron Thanksgiving Day in 1995.[45]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
