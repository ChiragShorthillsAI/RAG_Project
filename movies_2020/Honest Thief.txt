The film starsLiam Neeson,Kate Walsh,Jai Courtney,Jeffrey Donovan,Anthony RamosandRobert Patrick, and follows a former bank robber (Liam Neeson) who decides to turn himself in to the FBI, only to be set up by corrupt agents.
Honest Thiefwas theatrically released, including inIMAX, in the United States on October 16, 2020, byOpen Road FilmsandBriarcliff Entertainment. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Neeson's performance, but noted the film's familiarity.[7][8]
Tom Dolan is a formerUS Marineand demolitions expert. After years of service, Tom decided to use his knowledge and skills to become a successful bank robber known to the public as the "In-and-Out Bandit". One day, while he was storing money in a storage unit, he met Annie Wilkins, a psychology graduate student employed by the facility. The pair seemed inseparable as they worked together to store his money, Annie unaware that the money was stolen.
A year later, Tom, wanting to live a life with Annie without the guilt of his past, turns himself and the ill-gotten money over to the government in exchange for a much more lenient sentence. Tom sets up a meeting withFBIagents Sam Baker and Meyers. Agent Baker promised to meet with Tom the very next day. However, Baker was out for the day, so they redirect the case to agents John Nivens and Ramon Hall.
They meet with Tom, and Tom reveals the location of the stolen money, in the storage unit he rented. Later, Tom reveals that there was only 3 millions dollars, not the 9 million he had promised them. Sam checks out the case for himself, and is shot with a9mmby Nivens. Tom witnesses the event unfold, and jumps out of a window, right in front of Annie.
Tom realizes that they tricked him into revealing the location of his stolen money. He barely escapes with his and Annie's life, now fully aware that Nivens and Hall wanted to keep the money for themselves. Tom reveals that he robbed banks as revenge for his father'sCEO's unfair treatment of his father, who had grown depressed due to the death of Tom's mother, and who later committed suicide. Tom kept robbing banks because it was exhilarating. He tells Annie to hop onto a bus to keep herself safe. However, she gets off the bus without his consent to pick up the storage unit's security footage card. Returning to the storage unit, Nivens and Hall come to pick up the footage card to cover their tracks, resulting in Nivens knocking her unconscious, because she "was a witness" to their crime. When Tom finds her, he rushes her to the hospital. When Baker's partner, Sean Meyers, attempts to arrest Tom, Tom explains everything and barely manages to evade capture. Driven by angst and suspicion, Meyers begins to notice discrepancies in Nivens' story.
After ambushing Hall in his home, Tom is able to get the security footage and the location of the safe house from him. Hall reveals that Tom needs to get Annie out of the hospital before Nivens kills her. Tom asks Annie for her help in getting the security footage to Meyers. After setting up a bomb to destroy Nivens' house, Nivens makes his way to the safe house expecting to find Hall there. Little does he know, Tom is secretly waiting for him. When Nivens discovers that Hall has already turned over the security footage, he flies into a rage and murders Hall. During the struggle, Tom is left wounded but manages to fight off Nivens. Before Nivens can get away with the stolen money, Tom calls Nivens, letting him know there is a pressure-sensitiveIEDunder his car seat, forcing Nivens to call the bomb squad. Meyers quickly apprehends Nivens. His car is searched and the stolen money is recovered. It's then revealed that the IED is a dud.
Annie provides Meyers the rest of the stolen money hidden in another storage unit as well as a voice recording of Tom's confrontation with Nivens by Hall, where he had caught Nivens's confession to Baker's murder as well as his murder of Hall.
Knowing he must take responsibility for the bank robberies and stealing the nine million dollars, Tom turns himself in. In response to his confession, Meyers offers a reassuring promise - he will do what he can to lessen his sentence. Meyers sees through Tom and truly admires his conviction. He acknowledges Tom's uncovering of Nivens' illegal activities. If it weren't for the circumstances, Meyers muses that Tom could have made a terrific FBI agent.

Owen GleibermanofVarietycomplimented Neeson for not phoning in his performance, but added, "Honest Thiefisn't incompetent (for a certain kind of pulp action fan, it delivers just enough of the goods), but it's a textbook case of an action movie that goes through the motions."[23]Frank Scheck forThe Hollywood Reportersaid the film "delivers exactly what you expect" and wrote, "Running a sleek 90 minutes before the credits roll,Honest Thiefis certainly efficient if not exactly original, with writer/director Williams infusing it with enough quirky character touches — such as Tom crankily complaining how much he hates his 'In and Out Bandit' moniker — to distract from the derivative feeling of it all."[24]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
