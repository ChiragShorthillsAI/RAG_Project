The film's plot follows a group of four agingVietnam Warveterans who return to the country in search of the remains of their fallen squad leader, as well as the treasure they buried while serving there.
Originally written byDanny BilsonandPaul De Meoin 2013, the script was re-worked by Lee andKevin Willmottfollowing the pair's successful collaboration inBlacKkKlansman(2018). The cast joined in February 2019 and filming began a month later, lasting through June and taking place inSoutheast Asia. With a production budget of $35–45 million, it is among Lee's most expensive films.
The film was released byNetflixon June 12, 2020.[2]It received acclaim from critics, who praised the direction, themes, and the performances of Lindo, Peters and Boseman, with many considering it among Lee's best works. The film received numerous accolades, including nominations for theAcademy Award for Best Original ScoreandScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, and was named by theNational Board of Reviewas theBest Film of 2020.
During the Vietnam War, a squad ofblackUS Army soldiers of the1st Infantry Division,[3]Paul, Otis, Eddie, Melvin, and their squad leader Norman, who dub themselves the "Bloods," secure the site of aCIAairplane crash and recover its cargo, a locker of gold bars intended as payment to theLahu peoplefor their help in fighting theViet Cong. The Bloods decide to take the gold for themselves and bury it so they can retrieve it later. However, in the ensuing Vietnamese counter-attack, Norman is killed, and the Bloods cannot locate the buried gold after a napalm strike obliterates the identifying landmarks.
In the present day, Paul, Otis, Eddie, and Melvin meet up inHo Chi Minh City. A recent landslide had uncovered the tail of the crashed plane, and with this new information, they plan to find the gold and Norman's body. Otis reunites with his old Vietnamese girlfriend Tiên, who reveals that he is the father of her grown child. Tiên introduces the Bloods to Desroche, a French businessman who agrees to help the Bloods smuggle the gold out of Vietnam once they retrieve it. Soon thereafter, they are joined by Paul's son David, who has a tempestuous relationship with his father.
Vinh, a tour guide hired by the Bloods, leads the group out into the countryside, where a confrontation with a local merchant forces Paul to admit that he haspost-traumatic stress disorder. At a hotel bar, David meets Hedy, the founder of LAMB, an organization dedicated to clearing landmines. The next day, Vinh drops off the group and tells them he will pick them up in a few days. During their first night, Paul confiscates a pistol from Otis which had been secretly given to him by Tiên and becomes suspicious of his motives. Eventually, the Bloods find the gold bars scattered across the side of a hill. They also find Norman's remains and pray over them. Eddie reveals that his excessive spending has rendered him broke but reminds the Bloods of Norman's original plan to give the gold to their black brethren in the United States.
On the hike out, Eddie steps on a landmine and is killed. David also steps on a mine but does not trigger it, just as Hedy and two other volunteers from LAMB, Simon and Seppo, show up. Paul and the others manage to pull David off the mine safely. Paul then holds the three outsiders hostage with Otis's gun, paranoid that they will report them to the authorities. During the night Seppo escapes while David and the others forcibly disarm Paul.
When the Bloods regroup with Vinh, a group of gunmen shows up demanding the gold in exchange for Seppo, whom they have captured. In the ensuing shootout, David is shot in the leg, and Seppo is killed by a landmine. All of the gunmen are killed except for one, who flees. Assuming that Desroche has crossed them, Vinh suggests retreating to a nearby abandoned temple to defend themselves from reinforcements. Unwilling to trust Vinh, Paul takes his share of the gold and heads out into the jungle alone. The remaining Bloods offer Vinh, Hedy, and Simon a share of the remaining gold for their trouble.
As he rages to himself, Paul has a vision of Norman who reminds Paul that he was the one who had accidentally killed Norman during a firefight and that he should let go of his guilt. He is subsequently located and killed by Desroche's men. Desroche, now wearing Paul'sMAGA hat, arrives with the gunmen at the temple and is then ambushed by Otis, Melvin, and Vinh. All of his men are subsequently killed. Desroche wounds Otis and tries to finish him off with a hand grenade, but Melvin sacrifices himself byleaping on top of it. As Desroche prepares to execute Otis, David shoots and kills him with Otis's gun.
Vinh helps the surviving Bloods share out the gold. Melvin's widow receives his share, and Eddie's goes to aBlack Lives Matterorganization. Hedy and Simon donate their shares to LAMB in Seppo's name. Norman's remains are brought home to his family by the military. David reads a letter from Paul, who tells him that he will always love him. Otis visits Tiên and bonds with his daughter for the first time.
The film was originally a 2013spec scriptby Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo titledThe Last Tour, withMike Bundlieand Barry Levine Executive Producing and withOliver Stoneset to direct.[4]Stone dropped out in 2016, and in 2017 producer Lloyd Levin pitched the script to Spike Lee, who performed a re-write with Kevin Willmott.[1]The two changed the film to an African-American perspective, added the film's flashback sequences and expanded the role of the Stormin' Norman character.[1]For his research, Lee creditedWallace Terry's 1984 bookBloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veteransas particularly helpful, and assigned it to the film's actors.[1]
Samuel L. Jackson,Denzel Washington,Giancarlo Esposito, andJohn David Washingtonwere initially cast in the lead roles but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts.[5]In February 2019, it was announced thatNetflixwould distribute the film, withChadwick Boseman,Delroy Lindo, andJean Renoset to star.[6]Jonathan Majorsentered negotiations to join later that month.[7]In March 2019,Paul Walter Hauser,Clarke Peters,Isiah Whitlock Jr.,Norm Lewis,Mélanie Thierry, andJasper Pääkkönenjoined the cast of the film.[8][9]Esposito was also confirmed for the cast, although he later dropped out.[10]This was the final film release of Chadwick Boseman during his lifetime.
Filming began on March 23, 2019.[11]Production lasted three months, mostly shooting inHo Chi Minh City,Bangkok, andChiang Mai. The ruins where an action sequence takes place, meant to represent theMỹ Sơntemples, were a specifically constructed set built by the film crew using wood andStyrofoamin a period of two months.[1]Unlike other films, including Netflix'sThe Irishman, Lee had the main cast (most of whom were in their 60s) play the 20-year-old versions of themselves in flashback sequences without the use ofde-aging technologyor make-up, bar for the final shot of their younger versions.[1]Lee considered it an effective way to visually show that the aged characters remain trapped in the wartime memories, stating, "These guys are going back in time, but this is how they see themselves."[1]
Da 5 Bloodsuses fouraspect ratiosas framing devices which distinguish between the film's different time periods and locations.[12]The 1960s flashback sequences were shot in 1.33:1 format on16 mm film, mimicking newsreel footage of the time.[12][1]Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, who proposed the idea, stated, "Vietnam was the first war that was really televised, and it was predominantly shot with 16-mm. [...] It’s how the American public perceived the war."[1][13]Netflix executives initially were resistant to the proposal given the challenges it presented, but Lee was adamant and was eventually allowed to proceed.[13]With the exception of a brief scene filmed using aSuper 8 camerain 2.39:1 ratio, the modern scenes were shot digitally. The present-day city scenes were framed in widescreen 2.39:1 ratio, evoking the aesthetics ofDavid Lean's epics such asLawrence of Arabia. The present-day jungle scenes were captured in 1.85:1 ratio, as Lee and Sigel sought to envelop the group with the vastness of the jungle.[12]
Themusical scoreforDa 5 Bloodswas written by composerTerence Blanchard.[14]In addition to Blanchard's score, the film features several songs from the early 1970s.[15]Most predominantly, the film contains six songs fromMarvin Gaye's 1971 albumWhat's Going On. "That record was released when I was young, but I could feel what was going on in the country," said Blanchard. "When Spike has that music put in a film it becomes extremely powerful for so many reasons."[16]The six main characters share the same first names as the members ofThe Temptationsand their producerNorman Whitfield.[17]A soundtrack album was released byMilan Recordson June 5, 2020.[18]
Da 5 Bloodswas released on June 12, 2020, byNetflix.[19][20]Prior to theCOVID-19 pandemic, the film was originally scheduled to premiere out-of-competition at the2020 Cannes Film Festival, then play in theaters in May or June before streaming on Netflix.[1]
Upon release, it was the top-streamed film in its first weekend,[21]before falling to sixth place in its second.[22]At their Q2 report meeting in July 2020, Netflix reported the film had been viewed by 27 million households since its release.[23]In November,Varietyreported the film was the 16th-most watched straight-to-streaming title of 2020 up to that point.[24]In March 2021,Varietyreported the film was among Netflix's most-watched Oscar-nominated titles, and assigned it an "audience appeal score" of 81 out 100.[25]
Onreview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 303 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "Fierce energy and ambition course throughDa 5 Bloods, coming together to fuel one of Spike Lee's most urgent and impactful films."[26]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[27]
Writing for theChicago Sun-Times,Richard Roepergave the film four out of four, saying: "The picture, the script and director Lee all deserve nomination consideration, as does the lush and booming score by Lee's longtime collaborator Terence Blanchard... Whitlock, Lewis, Peters and Boseman deserve supporting actor conversation, while Delroy Lindo should be an instant contender for best actor".[28]Richard BrodyofThe New Yorkerwrote that the film "runs two hours and thirty-four minutes, but it's not a second too long. On the contrary, it feels compressed, bustling, and frenzied with its intellectual and dramatic energy."[29]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reportercalled the film "as timely as today's news", writing: "Lee deftly steers it all full circle in a series of brief wrap-up scenes that are both fancifully tidy and deadly serious, acknowledging theBlack Lives Mattermovement in a way that allows this sprawling, unwieldy, frequently brilliant film to close on a profoundly affecting note of hope and catharsis. Structural flaws notwithstanding, this movie is a gift right now, and there's no other director that could have made it."[30]
Eric Kohn ofIndieWiregave the film a grade of "B" and wrote: "A loose, caustic look at the Vietnam war through the prism of black experiences,Da 5 Bloodswrestles with the specter of the past through the lens of a very confusing present, and settles into a fascinated jumble as messy and complicated as the world surrounding its release."[31]Writing forVariety, Peter Debruge called the film "ambitious but uneven" and said that "Lee interweaves potent social critique with escapistB-moviethrills as four veterans return to 'Nam to claim the loot they were ordered to retrieve decades earlier, but stashed for themselves instead. The result is overlong and erratic, but also frequently surprising...propelled by an unforgettable turn from Delroy Lindo".[32]Ann Hornaday ofThe Washington Postgave the film three out of four, writing that "its moments of stinging insight and soaring cinematic rhetoric once again prove why Spike Lee might be America's most indispensable filmmaker".[33]
CriticMark Kermodecalled the film "a mixed bag".[34]Writing forThe Guardian, he gave the film three out of five, praising its political and comedic aspects as well as Lindo's performance, but wrote negatively of its "tonal shifts", noting that "warring elements ofDa 5 Bloodsappear bolted together".[35]Chuck Bowen ofSlant Magazinegave the film two-and-a-half out of four, concluding: "At its best,Da 5 Bloodsoffers a damning, impassioned, hallucinatory collage of images and ideas concerning the relationship between racism and warfare with superb performances. At its worst, it's a vibrant mess."[36]
Da 5 Bloodsappeared on 77 critics' year-end top-ten lists, including ten first-place rankings and six second-place ones.[37]
In an article forThe New York Times, Pulitzer-winning novelistViet Thanh Nguyenexpressed his mixed feelings. He notes, that even with a new central perspective of black soldiers and justified messaging, the film still reanimates tropes such as victimizing Vietnamese and being America-centric. He said, "If one can't disentangle Black subjectivity from dominant American (white) subjectivity, it’s impossible to apply a genuine anti-imperialist critique. Hence the marginalized Vietnamese continuing to serve their role as excuses for a Black drama staged against America's Black-white divide."[38]
Hoai-Tran Bui echoes similar perspectives in her analysis for the blog/Film, saying Lee's work "is haunted by, even enamored with, the legacy ofApocalypse Now". Still, she notes "Lee does take steps to undercut past Hollywood depictions of the Vietnamese people as faceless victims", referencing the major presence of the tour guide character Vinh and the rare focus onAmerasianchildren.[39]
For the publication AwardsWatch, Nguyen Le sees many areas of the film, "in an imperfect-but-commendable way", a departure from Hollywood's constant portrayal of Vietnam as nothing more than a war. He also wonders the possibility of Vietnamese communities no longer hyper-entrenching themselves in wartime memories and instead focusing on combating anti-black racism from within and without. "As the end ofDa 5 Bloodsshows, there are more important issues to tend with than the past, sometimes it's because we have finished confronting it", he wrote.[40]

Daniel Bilson(born July 26, 1956) is an American writer, director, and producer of movies, television, video games, and comic books. Together with his frequent collaborator,Paul De Meo, he is best known as the writer for the filmThe Rocketeer(1991) and creator, writer, producer and director for the television seriesViper(1994, 1996),The Sentinel(1996)  andThe Flash(1990).  He has written multiple issues of the comic bookThe Flash, as well as scripts for multiple video games, includingJames Bond 007: Everything or Nothing(2003).Da 5 Bloods(2020), based on a screenplay written by Bilson & De Meo, was released following De Meo's death.
While actively working as a writer and producer, Bilson is also a tenured faculty member at theUniversity of Southern California (USC), where he holds the positions of Director of USC Games and the Chair ofUSC's School of Cinema'sInteractive Media and Games Division.
Bilson was born into a show business family in Los Angeles, California, the son of Mona (Weichman) (1933–2023) and the directorBruce Bilson(b. 1928) (Bewitched,Get Smart,Hogan's Heroes).[1]As a child, he discovered his passion for both storytelling and games, both of which would greatly influence his career.
He has three daughters; his eldest,Rachel Bilson(born on August 25, 1981) is an actress, notable for her role inThe O.C.andHart of Dixie. He, his wife Heather Medway, and two younger daughters, Hattie Elizabeth Bilson, born December 19, 2001, and Rosemary, born February 10, 2007, reside inLos Angeles.
Bilson graduated fromCalifornia State University, San Bernardino.  There he met and teamed up with his best friend and long-time writing partner,Paul DeMeo, and together they founded Pet Fly Productions.
After graduating from college, Bilson worked aggressively to build a career in the movie business, working as an extra while writing screenplays. Bilson and DeMeo produced their first script,Trancers(1985), anoirtale about atime-travellingdetective from the future.  The movie became a cult classic, and the narrative was so engaging that it evolved into a franchise that generatedfive sequels.Trancerscurrently holds an 83% Freshness Score onRotten Tomatoes.[2]
In 2021, Bilson appeared on late night radio show,The Ghost of Hollywood, where he would discuss his work onTrancers.[3]
Bilson debuted as a director for another cult classicZone Troopers(1985), also co-written by DeMeo, a tale of AmericanWorld War IIsoldiers who find an alien spacecraft. The movie was filmed in Italy.
Following this, the duo performed the same roles inThe Wrong Guys(1988) a comedic spoof of boy scouting.
Larry Davidalso visited the set ofThe Wrong Guysduring production.[4][5]
Bilson and DeMeo began their screenplay adaptation of the comic bookThe Rocketeerin 1985. While writing forDisney, the partners weathered the ups and downs of five years of movie development. The film was released in theaters in 1991, missing key deleted scenes that were only restored years later as part of the home video release.[6]The Rocketeerhas become one of the most beloved Disney live action films of the '90s, with a recent announcement to reboot it as a film franchise as well as an animated series.[7]
For most of the 1990s, Bilson and DeMeo worked as Executive Producers and creators on various action-adventure and sci-fi series for multiple studios and networks, including the first TV incarnation ofThe Flash, and multiple action seriesViper,Human Target,andThe Sentinel.
During an interview onThe Ghost of Hollywood, Bilson discusses he and DeMeo's transition into writing for television and video games after their time working for Empire Pictures.[5][4]
After a chance meeting with then-President of Electronic Arts in 2000,Don Mattrick, Bilson—an avid tabletop and video gamer his entire life—was brought on as a production lead to focus on guiding creative and narrative IP development at EA.  During that time, he was a consulting producer for the video gameThe Sims(2000), as well as creative executive on the EA'sHarry Potter video game franchise, working directly withJK Rowlingand acting as a liaison between the author, EA, andHarry Potter filmdistributorWarner Bros.  He also wrote for multiple EA game franchises, includingCommand & Conquer,Medal of Honor, andJames Bond 007.
In 2008, THQ approached Bilson to take on the role of VP of Creative Production, formally taking on the same function there as he had done informally at EA.  Executives at the company, after seeing the positive impact his input had on titles in their development pipeline, and his leadership skills when it came to interacting with developers as well marketing staff, promoted him to Executive Vice President of Global Production and Marketing.[8]
In that role, Bilson led over a dozen internally owned production studios, and 30+ marketing, administrative and operations staff at THQ's headquarters inAgoura Hills.  One of his first tasks was to develop a clear strategic framework for the inherited portfolio of studios the company owned, as many had previously been purchased without one in place, resulting in the company owning over 20 studios at its peak.
After the painful process of having to streamline staff and studios, Bilson—with his partner DeMeo acting as a narrative design executive—focused on building and cultivating "Core game" franchises, lobbying executives for sufficient production and marketing funds to launch and/or maintain new and ongoing franchises such asSaints Row,Red Faction,Darksiders,MX vs ATV,Homefront,De Blob, andMetro 2033.  He also led the launches for new installments of Core licensed IP such asWWE Smackdown vs Rawand the successful launch of theUFC video gamefranchise.
Despite the positive early results in the Core Business Unit that Bilson managed, the company's outsize investments in its separately led, declining Kids & Family Business Unit continued to drag on its overall financials.  After successfully launching aNintendo Wiiperipheral—theuDraw Gaming Tablet—in 2010, executives at THQ made an aggressive investment in launching a uDraw peripheral for the then-new consolesXbox 360andPlayStation 3in 2011. The product did not sell,[9]resulting in a massive write-off, the shuttering of the Kids & Family division, and sole reliance on the Bilson's Core Games business to drive the company's revenue.[10]
Unfortunately the $100 million shortfall created by uDraw,[11]coupled with ongoing Kids and Family licensing expenses, put the company in dire financial straits from which it never recovered.  Bilson left THQ in 2012,[12]succeeded byJason Rubin, who was the president of THQ before its closure due to bankruptcy on January 23, 2013.[13][14]
Overlapping with his time at EA and THQ, Bilson and DeMeo continued writing comics, sometimes to support internal THQ IP, but also co-writingThe Flash: The Fastest Man AliveforDC Comicswith actorAdam Brody, as well a mini-series forWildstorm ComicscalledRed Menace.
During his time at EA, Bilson began teaching at theUniversity of Southern California, after being encouraged to do so by his friend andWorld of Warcraftguildmate,Bing Gordon. There he instructs as an adjunct professor atUSC School of Cinematic Arts, where he teaches traditional screenwriting, as well as character development and storytelling for video games.
Bilson continues to work full-time as a screenwriter and producer, while teaching part-time at USC, where he was appointed Chair of theUSC's Interactive Media and Games Divisionin 2017.[15]
He was appointed Director of USC Games, a joint education program co-managed byUSC's School of Cinematic ArtsandUSC Viterbi School of Engineering, in March 2019.[16]
Bilson's lifelong writing partner and best friend of over 40 years,Paul De Meo, died in 2018,[17]just prior to the finalization of the sale of a script they co-wrote--Da 5 Bloods—to writer/director/producerSpike Lee,[18]fresh off his 2019Academy Awardwin forBest Adapted Screenplayfor the critically acclaimed filmBlacKkKlansman.[19]Da 5 Bloodswas distributed byNetflixand the film starredChadwick Boseman, along withDelroy LindoandJean Reno.

After, they did two comedies,Zone Troopers(1985) andThe Wrong Guys(1988). Next, they undertook the adaptation ofThe Rocketeerin 1985. Writing forDisney, the partners were hired and fired several times during the five years of movie development.
CreatorDave Stevensliked that "their ideas forThe Rocketeerwere heartfelt and affectionate tributes to the 1930s serials with all the right dialogue and atmosphere. Most people would approach my characters contemporarily, but Danny and Paul saw them as pre-war mugs."[3]that same year, the trio approachedWilliam Dearto direct/co-writeThe Rocketeer, and they eventually dropped the low-budget idea.[4]Bilson, De Meo, and Dear kept the comic book's basic plot intact, but fleshed it out to include a Hollywood setting and a climactic battle against a Nazi Zeppelin.[3]They also tweaked Cliff's girlfriend to avoid comparisons toBettie Page(Stevens' original inspiration), changing her name from Betty to Jenny and her profession from nude model to Hollywood extra (a change also made to make the film more family friendly).[4][3]The two had a rough executive experience, in which scenes were deleted only to be restored years later.[3]The film finally made it to theaters in 1991, where it underperformed at the box office but developed a cult following.
DeMeo would spend the rest of the 1990s working in television, creating programmes likeHuman Target, and would transition into video games in the 2000s, working on several James Bond games. He later wrote both the film adaptation and video game sequel toCompany of Heroes.

Following DeMeo's passing, Danny Bilson would interview with Paul's nephew,Rick Glassman, on the podcast Take Your Shoes Off. He discussed Paul's death, shared personal stories, and talked about the screenplay developed during Paul's illness forSpike Lee's film,Da 5 Bloods.[6]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
