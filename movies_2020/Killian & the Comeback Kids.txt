The film was released on September 18, 2020, makingKillian & the Comeback Kidsone of the first new films to play in American theaters during the pandemic, and one of the only independent films released exclusively to theaters.[14]Due to its "platform release" structure, during its first few weeks it was sometimes the only fully theatrical film opening in a given city, marking the first time in history that this happened.[15][16]
WithKillian & the Comeback Kids, Purdee became the youngest director of the year with a film in major US cinema circuits, a trend that repeated itself the next year upon the film's 2021 continued release.[17][18]The initial release also made him the first mixed-race director/star of African American heritage to have a narrative film released to US theatres in the 21st century.[19][20]
According to an early 2021 interview with the director, the film was slated to open again exclusively in cinemas that remained closed for the entirety of the 2020 leg of thecoronavirus outbreak, in September 2021 before ever becoming available digitally.[21]
The film did return to theatres in September 2021 after the reopening of major moviegoing markets and played another fully theatrical national run.[22]The film was not released online until August 2022 making for one of the most unique theatrical release patterns of the COVID era.[23][19]

Hope Runs Highis an Americanfilm distributioncompany. They began preserving digitally and distributing out-of-printdocumentary filmsbefore expanding to narrative and first-run theatrical films. A unique element of their library is that much of it focuses on films by women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ filmmakers and subjects.[1]The company also houses a small record label that releases movie soundtracks and film scores.[2]
Hope Runs High acquired the distribution rights for a library of acclaimed documentary films. This collection included films fromAcademy Award-winning actress/directorLee Grant, including her 1986Best Documentary FeaturewinnerDown and Out in America,[3]and filmmakerRichard Morris' Oscar-shortlistedmusicaldocumentaryWallowitch & Ross: This Moment. Many of these films feature LGBTQ+ characters and were not seen in mainstream cinema at the time of their original release, rescuing and showcasing a unique corner ofqueer cinema.[4]
In 2019, Hope Runs High began to refocus on theatrical distribution, beginning with a limited theatrical re-release of documentaries by Grant.[5][6]Grant's films launched as part of aretrospectiveat New York'sFilm Forumand marked the first retrospective of her work to look at her time as both actoranddirector, and the first time many of the films had been exhibited in decades.[7]

An expansion of Grant's documentaries toart houseandrepertorycinemas was cut short by theCOVID-19 pandemic. In response, the re-release of Grant's films was redesigned as one of the earliest examples of avirtual cinemarelease. The collection of Grant's documentaries was curated for virtual cinemas byTaylor A. Purdeeand has become the first virtual retrospective in the United States, and the largest series on Grant's directorial work.[9]
Subsequently, it was announced that theAmerican Film Institutewould honor Grant's lifetime achievements specifically as a documentarian during its 2020AFI Docsfilm festival with a digital showing of Grant'sDown and Out in Americaaccompanying the celebration. Due to the pandemic, the festival has been held virtually for the first time.[10][11]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
