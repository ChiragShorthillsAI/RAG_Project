The project was announced in May 2020, with screenwriters Adam Mason and Simon Boyes having come up with the idea in March, shortly after the pandemicstopped all film production; the cast joined in June.
Songbirdwas released throughpremium video on demandon December 11, 2020, bySTX Films. It was overwhelmingly panned by critics, who said it did not take advantage of its premise, although Stormare's performance was praised by some.
By 2024,COVID-19has been mutated into COVID-23 and the world is in its fourthquarantine year. In the United States, the nation's government is converted into a fascistpolice stateand the people are required to take temperature checks on their cell phones while those infected with COVID-23 are taken from their homes against their will and forced into quarantine camps, also known as "Q-Zones" orconcentration camps, where some fight back against the brutal restrictions. In these camps, the infected are left to die or forcibly get better.
Nico Price, a motorbikecourierwithimmunity, due to the fact he was infected with the virus, is in a virtual relationship with Sara Garcia, a young artist living with her grandmother Lita whose lockdown prohibits them from physical contact. Nico works for Lester, who specializes in delivering packages to wealthy individuals. One of their biggest clients is the Griffins, Piper and William, whose daughter Emma has anauto-immune disorder. William is a former record executive having asexualaffairwith May, a singer who makes a living online selling covers of classic songs. May develops a bond with Michael Dozer, a disabled war veteran who works for Lester as adroneoperator to keep track of their couriers.
One night, Lita begins to show symptoms of COVID-23 while the "sanitation" department, led by Emmett Harland, is forcing Sara's neighbor Alice out of her apartment after she becomes infected. Emmett warns Sara that their apartment building has seen a rise in infections. He has also killed one of the infected individuals who escaped from the nearby Q-zone with apocket knife. Sara informs Nico about Lita's condition, leading Nico to spend the night by Sara's apartment door. In the morning, Sara passes her temperature check, but Lita fails hers. Nico promises to keep Sara from being taken.
Nico contacts Lester to let him know that he's aware they are transporting illegal immunity wristbands. Lester tells him the Griffins are the ones selling them. When he goes to their house, the Griffins give Nico the phone number of their supposed supplier. Nico ends up meeting with Emmett at a warehouse, revealing it to be a trap which Nico escapes.
As Sara is waiting for Nico, Lita dies. The "sanitation" department arrives to bag Lita and detain Sara. Sara knocks out one of the members and takes hishazmat suitbefore escaping the building. Emmett and his team ultimately catch up to Sara, where he notes that Sara has yet to show symptoms of COVID-23 despite her exposure and is therefore immune. Sara is detained shortly afterward.
William demands to see May again, but May continually refuses, claiming she recorded him offering her an illegal immunity wristband. Piper overhears William's phone call with May and kicks him out of the house. William leaves to silence May, which Piper calls May to warn her about. May asks Michael if she can stay with him, to which he agrees. When May tries to leave, William arrives and tries to kill her, but Michael uses a weaponized drone to fatally shoot William.
Nico returns to the Griffins and confronts Piper, who says she was concerned Nico was trying to expose their illegal business. When Nico says he's only interested in saving Sara, Piper finally agrees to help and gives him a wristband for Sara. Nico returns to Sara's apartment to find Emmett, who tries to attack Nico but is stabbed by Nico in self-defense. Nico finds Sara's cell phone with a picture of the containment van and its tail number. With Lester and Michael's help, Nico races to the Q-Zone before Sara can be taken in. Nico is able to slip the immunity bracelet on Sara in time to be scanned, saving her from quarantine. As they embrace for the first time, Sara tells Nico she is truly immune.
In the aftermath, Piper and May frame William and Emmett as those responsible for the sale of illegal immunity wristbands. May and Michael begin a virtual relationship. Nico sends Lester his own immunity bracelet as thanks while he and Sara ride up thePacific Coast Highway.

The trailer was released in October 2020, with a poor response from critics and audiences. Criticism was aimed towards the production and timing of release due to the ongoingCOVID-19 pandemic, as well as romanticization of the topic, being compared unfavorably toRomeo and Juliet.[19][16]
Onreview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 9% based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10.

Alonso DuraldeofTheWrapwrote "It's not inherently misguided to use a current tragedy as the jumping-off point of a genre movie, but any filmmaker who decides to do so had better create something provocative or interesting or at least competent to justify it."[22]Writing forIndieWire, David Ehrlich gave the film a "D" and said, "For all of its gimmicky appeal,Songbirdis bad enough that your entire neighborhood will be able to smell it streaming onto your TV, and it gets worse faster than your nose can adjust to the stench."[23]Korey ColemanofDouble Toastedfound Peter Stormare's performance humorous, but criticized the overall message of the film, calling it "irresponsible", and noted the numerous plot holes imbued by the love story which overtook the entire premise.[24]
Rebecca Onion ofSlatewrote: "Songbirdisn't very good, which you might expect for something thrown together so quickly... But watching it in the midst of our slow-motion disaster, it looks not just bad, but ridiculous."[25]Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comgave the film 0/4 stars and wrote: "The truth is that even if one sets aside all potential moral arguments about the very existence ofSongbird, it's still just really bad."[26]Frank ScheckofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote: "Despite the high-stakes drama, there's nary a compelling moment throughout, and some of the characterizations... are so absurdly one-note that it's hard not to think that the film is meant as parody."[27]
Kevin MaherofThe Timeswas more positive in his review of the film, giving four out of five stars and writing: "It's patchy, admittedly, in places... but it's also audacious and the first mainstream film to address unapologetically, in every scene, in every frame of film, our present situation."[28]Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiangave the film three out of five stars, saying that it was "an acceptably watchable thriller that's more notable for what it achieves technically than anything else."[29]Robbie CollinofThe Daily Telegraphalso gave the film three out of five stars, saying that it was "even more spectacularly crass and exploitative than you could have possibly hoped", and concluded: "Songbirditself delivers an enjoyably tactless jolt of trash-cinema bravado."[30]

Demi Moore was born Demi Gene Guynes[n 1]on November 11, 1962, inRoswell, New Mexico. Her biological father,Air Forceairman Charles Foster Harmon Sr.,[13]deserted her then-18-year-old mother, Virginia (née King),[14]after a two-month marriage before Moore's birth.[15]Charles came fromLanett, Alabama, and Virginia was born inRichmond, Californiabut had grown up in Roswell.[16]Moore's maternal grandmother was raised on a farm inElida, New Mexico.[16]Moore has deep roots in theSouth CentralandSouthern United States, particularly Oklahoma, Arkansas and Georgia. When Moore was three months old, her mother married Dan Guynes, a newspaper advertising salesman who frequently changed jobs; as a result, the family moved many times.[17]In 1967 they had Moore's half-brother Morgan.[18]Moore said in 1991, "My dad is Dan Guynes. He raised me. There is a man who would be considered my biological father who I don't really have a relationship with."[15]Moore has half-siblings from Charlie Harmon's other marriages, but she does not keep in touch with them either.[19]
Moore's stepfather Dan Guynes married and divorced Virginia twice.[20]On October 20, 1980, a year after their second divorce from each other, Guynes committed suicide.[15][21]Her biological father Harmon died in 1997 from liver cancer inBrazoria, Texas.[22][23]Moore's mother had a long arrest record which included drunk driving and arson.[24]Moore broke off contact with her mother in 1989, when she walked away halfway through a rehab stay Moore had financed at theHazelden Foundationin Minnesota.[25]Virginia Guynes posed nude for the magazineHigh Societyin 1993,[26]where she spoofed Moore'sVanity Fairpregnancy and bodypaint covers and parodied her clay scene fromGhost. Moore and Guynes reconciled shortly before Guynes died of a brain tumor on July 2, 1998.[27]
Moore spent her early childhood in Roswell, and later,Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.[28]Bob Gardner, a photographer for theMonongahela Daily Heraldwhen Dan Guynes was head of advertising, recalled that Moore "looked malnourished and not so much abused as neglected. That haunting look as a child made me feel uneasy."[29]She suffered fromstrabismus, which was corrected by two operations, as well as kidney dysfunction.[17]Moore learned that Guynes was not her real father at age 13, when she discovered a marriage certificate and inquired about the circumstances since she "saw my parents were married in February 1963. I was born in '62."[15]
At age 14, Moore returned to her hometown of Roswell and lived with her grandmother for six months before relocating to Washington state, where her recently separated mother was residing near Seattle.[30]Several months later, the family moved again toWest Hollywood, California, where Moore's mother took a job working for a magazine distribution company.[15]Moore attendedFairfax High Schoolthere.[15]In 2019, she stated she was raped at 15 by landlord Basil Doumas, then 49.[31]Doumas claimed he had paid Moore's mother to get access to Moore to rape her, although Moore said it is unclear if this were true.[32][33]
In November 1978, Moore moved in with 28-year-old guitarist Tom Dunston, quitting high school in her junior year to work as a receptionist at20th Century Fox—a job she secured through Dunston's mother, who was an executive assistant to producerDouglas S.

Moore appeared on the cover of the January 1981 issue of the adult magazineOui,[44]taken from a photo session in which she had posed nude.[45]In a 1988 interview, Moore said she "only posed for the cover ofOui—I was 16; I told them I was 18." Interviewer Alan Carter said, "However, some peekaboo shots did appear inside. And later, nude shots of her turned up inCelebrity Sleuth—photos that she once said 'were for a European fashion magazine'."[46]In 1990, she told another interviewer, "I was 17 years old. I was underage. It was just the cover."[47]
Moore made her film debut as the protagonist's girlfriend inChoices(1981), a sports drama directed bySilvio Narizzano.[48]It did not garner much attention until after Moore became a household name, with home video releases heavily hyping up her appearance.[49]Her second feature was the3-Dsci-fi horrorParasite(1982), for which directorCharles Bandhad instructed casting director Johanna Ray to "find me the nextKaren Allen".[44]It proved to be a minor hit on thedrive-incircuit, ultimately grossing$7 million.[50]Moore had already joined the cast of theABCsoap operaGeneral Hospitalseveral months before the film's release, playing the role of investigative reporter Jackie Templeton through 1983. During her tenure on the series, she made an uncredited cameo appearance in the 1982 spoofYoung Doctors in Love.
Moore's film career took off in 1984 following her appearance in the sex comedyBlame It on Rio.[51]InNo Small Affair(1984), she played the love interest of an amateur photographer, oppositeJon Cryer. Her commercial breakthrough came with her role as an uninhibited banker inJoel Schumacher'syuppiedramaSt. Elmo's Fire(1985), which received negative reviews, but was a box office success and brought her widespread recognition.[52][53]Because of her association with that film, she was often listed as part of theBrat Pack, a label she felt was "demeaning".[54]
Moore progressed to more serious material with the romantic dramedyAbout Last Night...(1986), in which she played one half of a Chicago couple, alongsideRob Lowe. It marked a positive turning point in her career,[55]as Moore noted that, following its release, she began seeing better scripts.[56]Film criticRoger Ebertgave the film four out of four stars and praised her performance, writing, "There isn't a romantic note she isn't required to play in this movie, and she plays them all flawlessly."[57]The success ofAbout Last Night...was unrivaled by Moore's other two 1986 releases,One Crazy SummerandWisdom, the last youth-oriented films in which she would star.[50]
Moore made her professional stage debut in anoff-Broadwayproduction ofThe Early Girl, which ran at theCircle Repertory Companyin fall 1986.[58]In 1988, Moore starred as a prophecy-bearing mother in the apocalyptic dramaThe Seventh Sign—her first outing as a solo film star—[56]and in 1989, she played the quick-witted local laundress and part time prostitute inNeil Jordan'sDepression-era allegoryWe're No Angels, oppositeRobert De Niro.
Moore's most successful film to date is the supernatural romantic melodramaGhost, which grossed over$505 millionat the box office and was the highest-grossing film of 1990,[59]as well as the most rented videocassette of 1991.[60]She played a young woman in jeopardy to be protected by the ghost of her murdered boyfriend through the help of a reluctant psychic. The love scene between Moore andPatrick Swayzethat starts in front of apotter's wheelto the sound of "Unchained Melody" has become an iconic moment in cinema history.[61]Ghostwas nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Picture, while Moore's performance earned her aGolden Globenomination and theSaturn Award for Best Actress.[62]She started fashion trends with her uncharacteristicallygaminelook, and legions of women emulated the short haircut she sported throughout the film.[50][63]At one point,GhostandDie Hard 2, starring Moore's then-husbandBruce Willis, would occupy the number one and number two spots at the box office, a feat that would not be accomplished again for a married Hollywood couple until 2024.[64][65]
In 1991, Moore starred in the horror comedyNothing but Trouble, the mystery thrillerMortal Thoughts, and the romantic comedyThe Butcher's Wife. She took on the role of a clairvoyant woman in the latter to increase her fee following the success ofGhost, but later regretted making the film. Roger Ebert's review, nevertheless, described her portrayal as "warm and cuddly."[66]She maintained herA-liststatus with her leading roles as a lieutenant commander inRob Reiner'sA Few Good Men(1992), a morally tested wife inAdrian Lyne'sIndecent Proposal(1993), and a sexually charged employer inBarry Levinson'sDisclosure(1994). The three aforementioned films opened atop the box office and were blockbuster hits.[67]By 1995, Moore had become the world's highest paid actress.[68]

Her performance as a woman withdissociative identity disorderwas well received,[80][81]but the film itself garnered negative reviews and was deemed "naggingly slow" by some critics.[81]Moore then resumed her self-imposed career hiatus and continued to turn down film offers.[82]ProducerIrwin Winklersaid in 2001, "I had a project about a year and a half ago, and we made an inquiry about her—a real good commercial picture. She wasn't interested."[77]

A commercial success, the film made$259.1 millionworldwide. On Moore's role,Peter TraversofRolling Stoneremarked: "It's a relief when Demi Moore shows up as fallen angel [...] Moore, 40, looks great in a bikini and doesn't even try to act. Her unsmiling sexiness cuts through the gigglefest as the angels fight, kick, dance and motocross likeIndiana Jonesclones on estrogen."[84]Charlie's Angels: Full Throttlewas followed by yet another three-year absence. In the interim, Moore signed on as the face of theVersacefashion brand[85]and theHelena Rubinsteinbrand of cosmetics.[86]

Moore reunited withBlame It on Rioco-starMichael Cainefor the British crime drama filmFlawless(2008),[91]which saw her portray an American executive helping to steal a handful of diamonds from the London Diamond Corporation during the 1960s. Moore received positive reviews from critics;Miami Heraldwrote: "The inspired pairing of Demi Moore and Michael Caine as a pair of thieves in the diamond-heist semi-caper movieFlawlessgoes a long way toward overcoming the film's slack, leisurely pacing."[92][93]
In 2010, Moore played a daughter helping her father deal with age-related health problems in the dramedyHappy Tears,as well as the matriarch of a family moving into a suburban neighborhood in the comedyThe Joneses. The latter film was largely highlighted upon its theatrical release, with critics concluding that it "benefits from its timely satire of consumer culture—as well as a pair of strong performances".[94]InBunraku(2010), a film Moore described as a "big action adventure,"[95]she starred as a courtesan and a femme fatale with a secret past.[96]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
