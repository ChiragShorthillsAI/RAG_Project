Robert Anthony Rodriguez(/rɒˈdriːɡɛz/ro-DREE-ghez; born June 20, 1968)[1][2]is an American filmmaker, composer, and visual effects supervisor. He shoots, edits, produces, and scores many of his films in Mexico and in his home state ofTexas. Rodriguez directed the 1992 action filmEl Mariachi, which was a commercial success after grossing $2.6 million ($5.5 million in 2023 dollars) against a budget of $7,000 ($14,937 in 2023 dollars). The film spawned two sequels known collectively as theMexico Trilogy:Desperado(1995) andOnce Upon a Time in Mexico(2003).
Rodriguez directedFrom Dusk till Dawnin 1996 and developed itstelevision series adaptation(2014–2016).[3]He co-directed the 2005 neo-noir crime thriller anthologySin City(adapted from thegraphic novel of the same name) and the 2014 sequel,Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.
He is also the creator of theSpy Kidsfranchise, as well asThe Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D(2005),Planet Terror(2007),Machete(2010),We Can Be Heroes(2020), and also directedThe Faculty(1998) andAlita: Battle Angel(2019).
Rodriguez is a close friend and frequent collaborator of filmmakerQuentin Tarantino,[4]who founded the production companyA Band Apart, of which Rodriguez was a member. In December 2013, Rodriguez launched his own cable television channel,El Rey.
Rodriguez was born inSan Antonio, Texas, the son of Mexican parents Rebecca (néeVillegas), a nurse, and Cecilio G. Rodríguez, a salesman.[5][6]He began his interest in film at age eleven, when his father bought one of the firstVCRs, which came with a camera.[7]
While attendingSt. Anthony High School Seminaryin San Antonio, Rodriguez was commissioned to videotape the school's football games. According to his sister, he was fired soon afterward as he had shot footage in a cinematic style, getting shots of parents' reactions and the ball traveling through the air instead of shooting the whole play. In high school, he metCarlos Gallardo; they both shot films on video throughout high school and college.
Rodriguez went to theCollege of Communicationat theUniversity of Texas at Austin, where he also developed a love of cartooning. Not having grades high enough to be accepted into the school's film program, he created a daily comic strip entitledLos Hooligans.Many of the characters were based on his siblings – in particular, one of his sisters, Maricarmen. The comic ran for three years in the student newspaperThe Daily Texan, while Rodriguez continued to make short films.[8]
Rodriguez shot action and horror short films on video and edited on two VCRs. In late 1990, his entry in a local film contest earned him a spot in the university's film program. There he made the award-winning 16 mm shortBedhead(1991). The film chronicles the amusing misadventures of a young girl whose older brother sports an incredibly tangled mess of hair which she detests. Even at this early stage, Rodriguez's trademark style began to emerge: quick cuts, intense zooms, and fast camera movements deployed with a sense of humor.
Bedheadwas recognized for excellence in the Black Maria Film Festival. It was selected by Film/Video Curator Sally Berger for the Black Maria 20th-anniversary retrospective atMoMAin 2006.
The short filmBedheadattracted enough attention to encourage him to seriously attempt a career as a filmmaker.[9]He went on to shoot the action flickEl Mariachi(1992) in Spanish; he shot it for around $7,000 with money raised by his friend Adrian Kano and from payments for his own participation in medical testing studies.[10]During the process of these medical studies, he met Peter Marquardt, who went on to act inEl Mariachi. Rodriguez won the Audience Award for this film at theSundance Film Festivalin 1993.[11]Intended for the Spanish-language low-budget home-video market, the film was "cleaned up" byColumbia Pictureswith post-production work costing several hundred thousand dollars before it was distributed in the United States.[12]Its promotion still advertised it as "the movie made for $7,000". Rodriguez described his experiences making the film in his bookRebel Without a Crew(1995).[13]
Desperadowas a sequel toEl Mariachithat starredAntonio Banderasand introducedSalma Hayekto international audiences as her English-language breakthrough role.[14][15]Rodriguez went on to collaborate withQuentin Tarantinoon thevampirethrillerFrom Dusk till Dawn(also both co-producing itstwo sequels), and he wrote, directed, and produced theTV seriesfor his own cable network,El Rey.[16]Rodriguez has also worked withKevin Williamson, on the sci-fi thriller filmThe Faculty.[17]
Rodriguez, formerly a member ofWriters Guild of America West, left and maintainedfinancial corestatus in 2001.[18]
That year, Rodriguez enjoyed his first Hollywood hit withSpy Kids, which went on to become a movie franchise. A third "mariachi" film also appeared in late 2003,Once Upon a Time in Mexico, which completed theMexico Trilogy(also called the Mariachi Trilogy). He operates a production company calledTroublemaker Studios, formerly Los Hooligans Productions.[19]
Rodriguez  co-directedSin City(2005), an adaptation ofthe comic booksbyFrank Miller; Quentin Tarantino guest-directed a scene. During production in 2004, Rodriguez insisted Miller be credited as co-director, because he considered the visual style of Miller's comic art to be just as important as his own in the film. However, theDirectors Guild of Americawould not allow it, citing that only "legitimate teams",e.g.,the Wachowskis, could share the director's credit. Rodriguez chose to resign from the DGA, stating, "It was easier for me to quietly resign before shooting because otherwise I'd be forced to make compromises I was unwilling to make or set a precedent that might hurt the guild later on." By resigning from the DGA, Rodriguez was forced to relinquish his director's seat on the filmJohn Carter of MarsforParamount Pictures. Rodriguez had already signed on and had been announced as director of that film, planning to begin filming soon after completingSin City.[20][21]
Sin Citywas a critical hit in 2005 as well as a box office success, particularly for a hyperviolent comic book adaptation that did not have name recognition comparable to theX-MenorSpider-Man. He has an interest in adapting all of Miller'sSin Citycomic books.[22]
Rodriguez releasedThe Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirlin 2005, a superhero-kid movie intended for the same younger audiences as hisSpy Kidsseries.Sharkboy and Lavagirlwas based on a story conceived by Rodriguez's 7-year-old son, Racer, who was given credit for the screenplay. The film grossed over $69 million worldwide at the box office.[23]
Rodriguez wrote and directed the filmPlanet Terroras part of the double-bill releaseGrindhouse(2007). Quentin Tarantino directedGrindhouse's other film.
He has a series of "Ten Minute Film School" segments on several of his DVD releases, showing aspiring filmmakers how to make good, profitable movies using inexpensive tactics. Starting with theOnce Upon a Time in MexicoDVD, Rodriguez began creating a series called "Ten Minute Cooking School" in which he revealed his recipe for "Puerco Pibil" (based onCochinita pibil, an old dish fromYucatán), the same foodJohnny Depp's character, Agent Sands, ate in the film. The popularity of this series led to the inclusion of another "Cooking School" on the two-disc version of theSin CityDVD where Rodriguez teaches the viewer how to make "Sin City Breakfast Tacos", a dish (made for his cast and crew during late-night shoots and editing sessions) utilizing his grandmother's tortilla recipe and different egg mixes for the filling. He had initially planned to release a third "Cooking School" with the DVD release ofPlanet Terrorbut then announced on the "Film School" segment of the DVD that he would put it on theGrindhouseDVD set instead. The Cooking School, titled "Texas Barbecue...from the GRAVE!", is a dish based on the "secret barbecue recipe" of JT Hague,Jeff Fahey's character in the film.[24]
Rodriguez is a strong supporter ofdigital filmmaking, having been introduced to the practice by directorGeorge Lucas, who personally invited Rodriguez to use the digital cameras at Lucas's headquarters.[25]He was presented with the Extraordinary Contribution to Filmmaking Award at the 2010Austin Film Festival.
In 2010, Rodriguez produced a newPredatorsequel, entitledPredators. This film's script was based on early drafts he had written after seeing the original. Rodriguez's ideas included a planet-sized game preserve and various creatures used by the Predators to hunt a group of abducted yet skilled humans. Opening to mostly positive reviews, the film fared reasonably well at the box office.
Macheteis a feature film directed by Rodriguez and released in September 2010. It is an expansion of a faketrailerRodriguez directed for the 2007 filmGrindhouse. It starredDanny Trejoas the title character. Trejo, Rodriguez's 2nd cousin, has worked with him in some of his other movies such asDesperado,From Dusk till Dawn,Once Upon a Time in MexicoandSpy Kids, where Trejo first appeared as Machete. Although originally announced to be released direct-to-DVD as an extra on thePlanet TerrorDVD, the film was produced as a theatrical release.[26]
According to Rodriguez, the origins of the film go back toDesperado. He says, "When I met Danny, I said, 'This guy should be like the MexicanJean-Claude Van DammeorCharles Bronson, putting out a movie every year and his name should be Machete.' So I decided to do that way back when, never got around to it until finally now. So now, of course, I want to keep going and do a feature."[27]In an interview withRolling Stonemagazine, Rodriguez said that he wrote the screenplay back in 1993 when he cast Trejo inDesperado. "So I wrote him this idea of afederalefrom Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimesFBIorDEAhave a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, "That'sMachete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts." But I never got around to making it."[28]
Rodriguez hoped to filmMacheteat the same time asSin City: A Dame to Kill For.[29]Additionally, duringComic-Con International 2008, he took the time to speak about Machete, including such topics as: status, possible sequels after the release of Machete, and production priorities.[30]It was also revealed that he has regularly pulled sequences from it for his other productions, includingOnce Upon a Time in Mexico.[Citation Needed]Machetewas released in theaters September 3, 2010, in the U.S.
On May 5, 2010, Rodriguez responded to Arizona's controversial immigration law by releasing an "illegal" trailer on Ain't It Cool News.[31]The fake trailer combined elements of theMachetetrailer that appeared inGrindhousewith footage from the actual film,[32]and implied that the film would be about Machete leading a revolt against anti-immigration politicians and border vigilantes.[32]Several movie websites, includingInternet Movie Database, reported that it was the official teaser for the film.[32]However, Rodriguez later revealed the trailer to be a joke, explaining "it wasCinco de Mayoand I had too muchtequila."[32]
In May 2020, Rodriguez announced, via an Instagram post in which he posed with a puppet ofGrogu, that he would direct an episode from the second season of theDisney+seriesThe Mandalorian, part of theStar Warsfranchise.[33]He also tweeted a video of himself on the set of the episode playing a guitar next to Grogu.[34]Rodriguez was also an executive producer onThe Book of Boba Fett, a spin-off ofThe Mandalorianreleased in December 2021,[35]where he also voiced Dokk Strassi[36]and Mok Shaiz.[37]

In August 2021, Rodriguez had signed a two-year first-look deal withHBOandHBO Max.[39]
In 2023, he releasedSpy Kids: ArmageddononNetflix. The film received mixed reviews from critics.[40][41]
Since 1998, Rodriguez has owned the film rights toMike Allred's off-beat comicMadman. The two have hinted at the project being close to beginning on several occasions without anything coming of it. However, other projects have been completed first. (Allred was instrumental in connecting Rodriguez with Frank Miller, leading to the production ofSin City.) In 2004, Allred, while promoting his comic bookThe Golden Plates, announced that a screenplay byGeorge Huangwas near completion. Allred announced at the 2006WonderConthat production would likely commence onMadman the Moviein 2006. Huang is friends with Rodriguez, who advised him to pursue filmmaking as a career when Rodriguez landed a deal withColumbia Pictureswhere Huang was an employee.[citation needed]
In May 2007, it was announced that Rodriguez had signed on to direct a remake ofBarbarellafor a 2008 release.[42]At the 2007Comic-Conconvention, actressRosario Dawsonannounced that because ofBarbarella, production ofSin City: A Dame to Kill Forwould be put on hold. She also announced that she would be playing an amazon in the Barbarella film.[43]As of June 2008, plans to remake the film Barbarella withRose McGowanas the lead have been delayed; the actress and director were instead remaking the filmRed Sonja.[44]
In May 2008, Rodriguez was said to be shopping around a prison drama television series calledWoman in Chains!, withRose McGowanbeing a possibility for a lead role.[45]In May 2009, Rodriguez planned to produce a live-action remake ofFire and Ice, a 1983 film collaboration between painterFrank Frazettaand animatorRalph Bakshi.

In March 2014, Rodriguez showed his collection of Frank Frazetta original paintings inAustin, Texas, during theSXSWfestival.[55]
Rodriguez not only has the credits of producing, directing and writing his films, he also frequently serves aseditor,director of photography,camera operator,steadicamoperator, composer,production designer, visual effects supervisor, andsound editoron his films. This has earned him the nickname of "the one-man film crew". He abbreviates his numerous roles in his film credits;Once Upon a Time in Mexico, for instance, is "shot, chopped, and scored by Robert Rodriguez", andSin Cityis "shot and cut by Robert Rodriguez".
He calls his style of making movies "Mariachi-style" (in reference to his first feature filmEl Mariachi) in which (according to the back cover of his bookRebel Without a Crew) "Creativity, not money, is used to solve problems." He prefers to work at night, spending his day-time hours with his kids, when they're home, and says that he believes many creative people are "night people".[56]
In his bookThe DV Rebel's Guide,Stu Maschwitzcoined the term "Robert Rodriguez list", i.e. the filmmaker compiling a list of things they have access to like cool cars, apartments, horses, samurai swords and so on, and then writing the screenplay based on that list.[57]
Rodriguez wrote a blurb for the book that stated:
I'd been wanting to write a book for the new breed of digital filmmakers, but now I don't have to.  My pal and fellow movie maker Stu Maschwitz has compressed years of experience into this thorough guide.  Don't make a movie without reading this book![57]
Robert Rodriguez has brought a number of his favorite and most influential directors on his television show,The Director's Chair. Some of these directors includedJohn Carpenter,Quentin Tarantino, andGeorge Miller.
Rodriguez's favorite movie as a child wasEscape to Witch Mountain, and admits that film, alongsideWilly Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, variousJames Bondfilms and variousRay Harryhaussenfilms influenced and inspired him while he was working on theSpy Kidsseries.[58][59][60]
He also said on IGN that children will support anything that is empowering to them, citingHome AloneandMighty Morphin Power Rangers, saying "You can't understand, 'Why do you like Power Rangers?' Well, it's empowerment, and children – especially younger children – they need their mom just to go to the mall, you know?  They can't drive themselves wherever they want.  So when they see kids being very empowered, flying around in jet packs, being proactive, it's empowering to them".[61]
Rodriguez has cast certain actors in more than one of his projects.Danny Trejohas appeared in ten of his projects, whileAntonio Banderas,Salma Hayek, andCheech Marinhave all appeared in seven;Alexa PenaVegahas appeared in six, andJessica Alba,Daryl Sabara,Tom Savini, andPatricia Vonnehave all appeared in five.[62]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
