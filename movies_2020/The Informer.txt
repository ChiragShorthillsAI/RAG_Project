Several years ago, Peter Koslow was released early from prison on condition that he work as an undercoverinformantfor theFBI'sNew York Cityfield office. Having worked his way into aPolish crime organisation, he is about to provide his handler, Special Agent Wilcox, with substantial evidence to indict crime boss Ryszard "The General" Klimek. Koslow is outfitted with awireas he smuggles a large amount offentanylthrough the Polishconsulate's office with the intention of it being delivered to the General. However, Koslow's cohort Staszek learns of a potential buyer and instead veers off-plan. Meeting with the buyer, Koslow quickly deduces that he is anundercoverpolice officer. When tensions arise, the officer attempts to apprehend Koslow, but Staszek kills him. Listening to this over the wire, Koslow's handlers abandon him. Koslow and Staszek are brought before the General, and Koslow is told he will be required to return to prison in order to run thedrug tradeon the General's behalf. Initially reluctant, Koslow agrees after the lives of his wife and daughter are threatened.
Wilcox informs Koslow that he will continue to act as an informant while imprisoned, and in return he will be freed upon completion. Meanwhile,NYPDDetective Grens begins to investigate the murder of the undercover officer and suspects the Polish Mafia. He obtains security camera recordings of Koslow leaving the scene and the FBI vehicle driving by. The General and his wife visit with Koslow and his wife, Sofia, in preparation for Koslow's return to prison. The following day, Koslow breaks hisparole. Grens meets with Wilcox and Montgomery, who deny knowledge of the murder. He also speaks with Sofia, who refuses to divulge information about her husband. Meanwhile, Koslow begins his drug distribution but is thwarted by corrupt prison officer Slewitt who works for Smiley Phelps, the boss of theprison gangwho holds sway over the drug trade. Koslow is nearly killed until he reveals to Smiley that he is an informant working to take down the General, Smiley's competition. Koslow calls Wilcox for help, but she is unable to help after being ordered by Montgomery to "burn" Koslow to cover up the FBI's involvement in the operation that led to the murder of the undercover police officer. Koslow then calls Sofia, asking her to give Grens the secret audio recordings he taped while speaking with Wilcox.
Wilcox reluctantly leaks to the General's attorney that Koslow is an FBI informant, and the General orders him and his family to be killed. Koslow is attacked and nearly killed by a Polish gangster but manages to subdue his assailant. In an act of desperation, he takes Slewitt hostage and renders him unconscious. Meanwhile, Wilcox confronts Sofia and takes possession of the tapes. At the prison, Montgomery has taken command of the hostage situation and Koslow, using his past experience as a US Special Forcessniper, enacts a means of escape when he switches outfits with Slewitt and strategically places apropanetank behind them, causing a sniper to mistakenly kill Slewitt and hit the tank, triggering a massive explosion. Staszek and another Polish gangster attempt to kill Koslow's family, but Grens arrives and thwarts them. Grens is shot but Sofia saves him and both gangsters are ultimately killed.
Koslow is transferred via ambulance and awakens to find that Wilcox is his escort. She allows Koslow to escape as retribution for her actions. In NYC, Wilcox confronts Montgomery and has him arrested after she wears a wire to record him threatening to kill Koslow to cover up his actions. Grens and Wilcox partner to help Koslow and protect his family, sending Koslow into hiding until the FBI investigation into the corruption is concluded and he can be a free man.

Common was born on March 13, 1972, at the Chicago Osteopathic Hospital in Chicago'sHyde Parkneighborhood. He is the son of educator and former principal ofJohn Hope College PreparatoryHigh School, Mahalia Ann Hines, and formerABAbasketball player turned youth counselorLonnie Lynn.[15]Lynn shares the same first name as his father, grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather.[16]He is known by his middle name, Rashid, to his family and friends.[17]Lynn's godfather is basketball playerSpencer Haywoodwho was a teammate of his father on theDenver Rockets.[16]
Lynn was raised in theCalumet Heightsneighborhood.[18][19][20][21]His father left the family because of his drug and alcohol addictions while Lynn was young.[16]When he was aged two, Lynn's father attempted to take him and his mother to Seattle where he had arranged a tryout with theSeattle SuperSonics.[16]His father was arrested when the family stopped at a motel in Wisconsin and charged with false imprisonment.[22]
Lynn's parents divorced when he was six years old, resulting in his father moving toDenver, Colorado. This left Lynn to be raised by his mother; however, his father remained active in his life, and was able to get him a job with theChicago Bullsas a teenager. Lynn attendedFlorida A&M Universityfor two years under a scholarship and majored inbusiness administration.[23]
Lynn began rapping in the late 1980s, while a student atLuther High School Southin Chicago, when he, along with two of his friends, formed C.D.R., a rap trio that opened for acts such asN.W.AandBig Daddy Kane.[24]When C.D.R dissolved by 1991, Lynn began a solo career under the stage name ofCommon Sense. After being featured in theUnsigned Hypecolumn ofThe Sourcemagazine, he debuted as a solo artist in 1992 with the single "Take It EZ", followed by the albumCan I Borrow a Dollar?.
With the 1994 release ofResurrection, Common Sense achieved a much larger degree of critical acclaim which extended beyond the Chicago music scene. The album sold relatively well and received a strong positive reaction amongalternativeandunderground hip hopfans at the time.Resurrectionwas Common Sense's last album produced almost entirely by his long-time production partner,No I.D., who would later become a mentor to a youngKanye West.
In 1996, Common Sense appeared on theRed Hot Organization's compilation CD,America Is Dying Slowly(A.I.D.S.), alongsideBiz Markie,Wu-Tang Clan, andFat Joe, among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as "a masterpiece" byThe Sourcemagazine. He would later also contribute to theRed Hot Organization'sFela Kutitribute album,Red Hot and Riotin 2002. He collaborated withDjelimady Tounkaraon a remake of Kuti's track, "Years of Tears and Sorrow".
The song "I Used to Love H.E.R." fromResurrectionignited afeudwithWest Coast rap groupWestside Connection. The lyrics of the song criticized the path hip hop music was taking, utilizing a metaphor of a woman to convey hip hop[25]and were interpreted by some as directing blame towards the popularity of West Coastgangsta rap. Westside Connection first responded with the 1995 song "Westside Slaughterhouse," with the lyrics "Used to love H.E.R., mad cause I f*cked her". "Westside Slaughterhouse" also mentioned Common Sense by name, prompting the rapper to respond with the scathingPete Rock-produced attack song "The Bitch in Yoo". Common Sense and Westside Connection continued to insult each other back and forth before finally meeting withLouis Farrakhanand setting aside their dispute. Following the popularity ofResurrection, Common Sense was sued by anOrange County-basedreggaeband with thesame name, and was forced to shorten his moniker to simply Common.[26]
Initially scheduled for an October 1996 release, Common released his third album,One Day It'll All Make Sense, in September 1997. The album took a total of two years to complete and included collaborations with artists such asLauryn Hill,De La Soul,Q-Tip,Canibus,Black Thought,Chantay Savage, andQuestlove– a future fellow member of theSoulquariansoutfit. The album, which made a point of eschewing any gangsterism (in response to questions about his musical integrity), was critically acclaimed and led to amajor labelcontract withMCA Records. In addition to releasingOne Day, Common's first child, daughter Omoye Assata Lynn, was born shortly after the release of the album.
As documented by hip-hop journalist Raquel Cepeda, in the liner notes for the album, this event had a profound spiritual and mental effect on Common and enabled him to grow musically while becoming more responsible as an artist. She writes:
Common addresses family ethics several times onOne Day..., and the album sleeve is decorated with old family photos, illustrating the rapper's childhood, as well a quote from1 Corinthians 13:11, which summarizes the path to manhood:
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.
FollowingOne Day..., Common signed a major label record deal withMCA Recordsand relocated from Chicago to New York City in 1999. He began recording almost exclusively with a loose collective of musicians and artists (dubbed the "Soulquarians" by central figureQuestlove) throughout 1999, and made a few sporadic guest appearances onThe Roots'Things Fall Apart, and theRawkus Recordscompilation,Soundbombing 2.
In 2000, his fourth album,Like Water for Chocolate, was released to mass critical acclaim.Executive producedby Questlove and featuring significant contributions byJ Dilla, (who helmed every track except – "Cold Blooded", "Geto Heaven Part II", "A Song For Assata", "Pop's Rap Part 3...All My Children" & theDJ Premier-produced track "The 6th Sense"),Like Water for Chocolatetranspired to be a considerable commercial breakthrough for Common, earning the rapper his firstgoldrecord, and greatly expanding his fanbase among critics and listeners alike.
With both artists hailing from theGreat Lakes regionof the United States (Chicago and Detroit, respectively), Common andJ Dillaestablished their chemistry early on. Both became members of theSoulquarianscollective, and collaborated on numerous projects together, even placing one song, "Thelonius", on both theSlum VillagealbumFantastic, Vol. 2, and Common'sLike Water for Chocolate. As Dilla's health began to decline from the effects ofLupus Nephritis, he relocated to Los Angeles, and asked Common to make the move with him as a roommate (Dilla would later lose his battle with the rare disease).[27]
This album saw Common exploring themes (musically and lyrically), which were uncommon for a hip-hop record, as he does on the song "Time Travelin' (A Tribute To Fela)"; a homage toNigerianmusic legend, and political activistFela Kuti. The most popular single from the album "The Light" was nominated for aGrammy Award.
In 2002, Common released his fifth album,Electric Circus. The album was highly anticipated and praised by many critics for its ambitious vision. However, it was not as commercially successful as his previous album,Like Water for Chocolate, selling under 300,000 copies. An eclectic album,Electric Circusfeatured fusions of several genres such as hip hop, pop, rock, electronic, and neo-soul. The album's style tended to divide critics; some praised its ambitious vision while others criticized it for the same reason. Most of the criticism tended to revolve around the album's experimental nature; some felt Common had strayed too far from his previous sound. This was Common's second and last album for MCA, and the label's final release prior to its absorption into Geffen Records.
Around this time, Common appeared as a guest performer on singer and fellow SoulquarianBilal'sLove for Salealbum, recording a remake of the 1977Fela Kutisong "Sorrow, Tears & Blood".[28]Bilal also featured onElectric Circus, the first of many future collaborations with Common.[29]
In early 2004, Common made an appearance on fellow Chicagoan Kanye West's multi-platinum debut album,The College Dropout(on the song "Get Em High"), and announced his signing to West's then-newfound labelGOOD Music. West had been a longtime fan of Common and the two even participated in a friendly on-air MC battle, where West took jabs at his lyrical idol for "going soft" and wearing crochet pants (as he does for his appearance in the video for theMary J. Bligesong "Dance for Me"). The pair worked together on Common's next album,Be, almost entirely produced by Kanye West, with some help from Common's longtime collaboratorJames Yancey(J Dilla) – also a favorite of West. The album was released in May 2005, and performed very well, boosted by Kanye's involvement and the singles "The Corner", and "Go".Beearned Common the second gold record of his career, with sales topping out at around 800,000 copies.The Sourcemagazine gave it a near-perfect 4.5 mic rating,XXLmagazine gave it their highest rating of "XXL", and AllHipHop gave the album 4 stars. The album was also nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2006.
Following the release ofBein 2005, several mixed-race artists from the UK hip-hop scene took exception to Common's comments about interracial relationships on the song "Real People."Yungun,Doc Brownand Rising Son recorded a track over an instrumental version of "The Corner" named "Dear Common (The Corner Dub)." Common states that he has heard of the track but never actually taken the time to listen to it, and has not retaliated in song.[30]
Common's seventh LP titledFinding Foreverwas released on July 31, 2007. For this album, he continued his work withKanye West, as well as other producers such asWill.i.am,Devo Springsteen,Derrick Hodge, andKarriem Riggins, as well as the onlyJ Dilla-produced track, "So Far To Go". The album features guest spots from artists such asDwele,Bilal,D'Angelo, and UK pop starletLily Allen. The first single from the album was "The People" b/w "The Game". West predicted thatFinding Foreverwould win the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.[31]The album was nominated for Best Rap Album, but did not win, losing to West'sGraduation; however, Common did win his second Grammy for "Southside," which won the 2008 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by Duo or Group.
On July 31, 2007, Common performed a free concert in Santa Monica, California, on the 3rd Street Promenade to promote the release ofFinding Forever. Common explained to the audience that the title "Finding Forever" represented his quest to find an eternal place in hip-hop and also his wishes to be an artist for the rest of his life. The album debuted at #1 on the nationalBillboard200charts.
In an August 2007 interview withXXL, rapperQ-Tipof the groupA Tribe Called Queststated that he and Common were forming a group called 'The Standard', and were planning to record an album to be produced by Q-Tip; however, this never came to fruition.[32]
Common was instrumental in bridging the trans-Atlantic gap by signing UK's Mr. Wong and J2K to Kanye West's Getting Out Our Dreams recording outfit. Common met the pair during his tour in the UK earlier on in the year. It is speculated that the deal is not only to bring the UK and US hip hop genres together but that to rival Syco Music's cross-Atlantic success with Leona Lewis. He also has a deal with Zune mp3 players. In 2008 Common made an estimated 12 million dollars, making him equal in earnings toEminemandAkon, tied for the 13th highest grossing Hip-Hop artist.[citation needed]
The eighth album from Chicago hip-hop artist Common was originally scheduled to be released on June 24, 2008, under the nameInvincible Summer, but he announced at aTemple Universityconcert that he would change it toUniversal Mind Control.[33]The release date was pushed back to September 30, 2008, due to Common filmingWanted. The release date was set for November 11, 2008, however, it was once again pushed back to December 9, 2008.
The album'seponymouslead single"Universal Mind Control", was officially released on July 1, 2008, via the US iTunes Store as part ofThe Announcement EP(sold asUniversal Mind Control EPin the UK). The song features Pharrell, who also produced the track.The Announcement EPincluded an additional track titled "Announcement", also featuring Pharrell. The video for the lead single was filmed in September by director Hype Williams.

Although he left GOOD Music in 2011, Common was featured on the label's first compilation album, 2012'sCruel Summer. Common released a song entitled "Sweet", fromThe Dreamer/The Believer, which included lyrics critical of rappers who sing, although this criticism was not aimed specifically at Canadian recording artistDrake.[37]Drake took offense and responded by releasing "Stay Schemin'", a song withRick RossandFrench Montana.[38]Common fans only had to wait two-and-a-half days for him to respond to Drake'sdiss track. On February 13, 2012, Common commented on the feud by saying "It's over. But it was all in the art of hip hop. He said some things to me so I had to say some things back...I wouldn't say [he started it] but I know I heard something that I felt was directed to me so I addressed it. That's all. But you know, thank God we were able to move forward from it and all is good."[39]

The album, which Common revealed was originally going to be an EP, is set to featureVince Staples,James Fauntleroyand "some new artists from Chicago." The concept of the album was inspired by his troubled hometown of Chicago: "We came up with this concept 'nobody's smiling.' It was really a thought that came about because of all the violence in Chicago," he says. "It happens in Chicago, but it's happening around the world in many ways." He continues, "We was talking about the conditions of what's happening, when I say 'nobody's smiling.' But it's really a call to action."[42][43][44]On June 4, 2014, it was announced Common signed a recording contract withDef Jam Recordingsand No I.D.'s Artium Records.[45]It was also announcedNobody's Smilingwould be released July 22, 2014.[45]Lonnie "Pops" Lynn was to be featured on this album as well but the recording fell through as Lonnie's health declined.

She began her career in Cuba with a leading role in the romantic dramaUna rosa de Francia(2006). At the age of 18, she moved toMadrid, Spain, and starred in the popular dramaEl Internado(2007–2010). After moving to Los Angeles, de Armas had English-speaking roles in the psychological thrillerKnock Knock(2015) and the comedy-crime filmWar Dogs(2016).
De Armas rose to prominence for her roles as aholographicAIin the science fiction filmBlade Runner 2049(2017) and a nurse in the mystery filmKnives Out(2019), receiving a nomination for theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. She then playedBond girlPaloma in theJames BondfilmNo Time to Die(2021) and actressMarilyn Monroein the biographical dramaBlonde(2022), for which she received a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first Cuban to do this.
De Armas was born inHavana, Cuba,[1]and raised inSanta Cruz del Norte.[2]Her maternal grandparents wereSpanish migrants to Cubafrom the regions ofLeónandPalencia, both in the north of Spain.[3][4]Her father Ramón had various jobs, including a bank manager, teacher, school principal and deputy mayor of a town.[5]He previously studied philosophy at a Soviet university.[5][6]Her mother Ana worked in the human resources section of the Ministry of Education.[7][8][9]De Armas has one older brother, Javier, a US–based photographer[5][10]who, in 2020, was questioned by Cuban police due to his critical stance onDecree 349and his links to artists under government surveillance.[11]While de Armas grew up withfood rationing, fuel shortages and electricity blackouts during Cuba'sSpecial Period,[5][12]she has described her early life as happy.[7]
During her childhood and adolescence, de Armas had no Internet access and had limited knowledge of popular culture beyond Cuba.[13]She was allowed to watch "20 minutes of cartoons on Saturday and the Sunday movie matinee."[14]Her family did not own a video or DVD player, and she watched Hollywood movies in her neighbor's apartment.[15]She memorized and practiced monologues in front of a mirror,[16][17]and decided to become an actress when she was 12.[18]In 2002, aged 14, she successfully auditioned to join Havana'sNational Theatre of Cuba.[7][19]She sometimes hitchhiked to attend the "rigorous" course.[20][21]While a student, she filmed three movies.[5][8]She left the four-year drama course shortly before presenting her final thesis because Cuban graduates are forbidden from leaving the country without first completing three years of mandatory service to the community.[8][22]At age 18, with Spanish citizenship through her maternal grandparents,[3][12]she moved toMadridto pursue an acting career.[8]
In her native Cuba, de Armas had a starring role oppositeÁlex GonzálezinManuel Gutiérrez Aragón's romantic dramaUna rosa de Francia(2006).[12]Cuban actorJorge Perugorríasuggested that the director consider de Armas for the role, after meeting her while attending a birthday party with his daughters.[23][24]The director visited de Armas's drama school and interrupted the sixteen-year-old during her audition to inform her that the role was hers.[23][25]She travelled to Spain as part of a promotional tour for the film and was introduced to Juan Lanja, who would later become her Spanish agent.[23]She then starred in the movieEl edén perdido(2007) and had a supporting role inFernando Pérez'sMadrigal(2007), filmed at night without the permission of her drama school tutors.[8]
At age 18, de Armas moved to Madrid. Within two weeks of arriving, she met with casting director Luis San Narciso, who had seen her inUna rosa de Francia.[13]Two months later,[26]he cast her as Carolina in the dramaEl Internado,[8]in which she starred for six seasons from 2007 to 2010. The television show, set in a boarding school, became popular with viewers and made de Armas a celebrity figure in Spain.[8]In a break from filming, she starred in the successful coming-of-age comedyMentiras y Gordas(2009).[27]Despite the popularity ofEl Internado, de Armas felt typecast and was mainly offered roles as youngsters.[13]She asked to be written out of the show in its second to last season.[28]
After spending a few months living in New York City to learn English,[22]de Armas was persuaded to return to Spain to star in seventeen episodes of the historical dramaHispania(2010–2011).[2]She then starred inAntonio Trashorras's horror filmsEl callejón(2011) andAnabel(2015),[29]and in the dramaPor un puñado de besos(2014).[30]During a long period without acting work,[20]de Armas participated in workshops atTomaz Pandur's Madrid theatre company[5]and felt "very anxious" about the lack of momentum in her career.[14]
With encouragement from her newly hired Hollywood agent, she decided to move to Los Angeles.[13]When de Armas first arrived in Los Angeles in 2014,[31]she had to start her career again "from scratch."[15]She spoke very little English and, during early auditions, she often "didn't even know what [she] was saying."[6]She spent four months in full-time education to learn English,[32][28]not wanting to be confined to playing characters written specifically for Latina actresses.[8]She starred oppositeKeanu Reevesin her first Hollywood release—Eli Roth's erotic thrillerKnock Knock(2015)—and learned her lines phonetically.[33]Despite giving a positive review of the film, Randy Cordova of theArizona Republicfound de Armas to be "unconvincing" in her role.[34]Reeves then telephoned de Armas to invite her to star in a Spanish-language role in the thrillerDaughter of Godwhich he acted in and produced.[35]Producer Mark Downie hoped the film would be a star vehicle for de Armas, but due to executive meddling,Daughter of Godwas severely edited with de Armas' former starring role reduced. The film was ultimately released asExposedin 2016.[36][37]Frank ScheckofThe Hollywood Reporternoted that while she was "appealing" in her part, de Armas was unable to demonstrate her "character's intense emotional demands."[38]
De Armas had a supporting role inTodd Phillips'sWar Dogs(2016), acting oppositeMiles Telleras the wife of an arms dealer, and again learned her lines phonetically.[39]David Ehrlich of IndieWire found her to be "memorable in a thankless role".[40]She starred oppositeÉdgar Ramírezin the biopicHands of Stone(2016) as the wife of Panamanian boxerRoberto Durán. Despite its delayed release,Hands of Stonewas the first Hollywood film de Armas had filmed. She was contacted by directorJonathan Jakubowiczwhile still living in Madrid after watching her inEl Internado[28]and asked her to travel to Los Angeles to audition for the Spanish-language part.[12]In reviewing the film, Christy Lemire ofRogerEbert.comdescribed de Armas as "a hugely charismatic presence. But except for a couple of showy moments, she gets little to do besides function as the dutiful wife."[41]
InDenis Villeneuve's futuristic thrillerBlade Runner 2049(2017), de Armas had a supporting role as Joi, theholographicAIgirlfriend ofRyan Gosling's character, a blade runner. Mark Kermode ofThe Guardiansaid she "brings three-dimensional warmth to a character who is essentially a digital projection."[42]Anthony Lane ofThe New Yorkerfound her to be "wondrous": "Whenever Joi appears, the movie's imaginative heart begins to race."[43]While the performance was initially discussed as a breakthrough role,[44][31]the film underperformed commercially, and de Armas spent much of the following year in her native Cuba, where she purchased a house.[33]For her performance, she earned a nomination for theSaturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. Also in 2017, she had a supporting role in the action thrillerOverdriveas the love interest toScott Eastwood's character.[45]Stephen Dalton ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote that she "radiates more kick-ass charisma than her thankless sidekick role might suggest."[46]

She played a Dominican woman withcongestive heart failurein the short film, funded byMontefiore Medical Centerto raise awareness of organ donation.[47]While de Armas's scenes oppositeHimesh Patelin the 2019 romantic comedyYesterdaywere included in the film's trailer, they were cut from the final product. The directorDanny Boylesaid that, while de Armas was "really radiant" in her scenes, the introduction of a love triangle subplot did not test well with audiences.[48]
De Armas's role as an immigrant nurse in the ensemble murder mystery filmKnives Out(2019), written and directed byRian Johnson, was widely praised and marked a breakthrough for the actress.[49]When first approached about the project, she was unenthusiastic about the idea of playing a stereotypical "Latina caretaker" but soon realized that her character was "so much more than that."[50]Tom Shone ofThe Timesremarked, "The film's standout performance comes from its least well-known member, the Cuban de Armas, who manages the difficult task of making goodness interesting."[51]Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardiansaid her "striking" performance left a "lasting impression."[52]The film was a major box office success.[53]De Armas was nominated for theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical[54]with her also winning theSaturn Award for Best Supporting Actressand theNational Board of Review Award for Best Castwith the cast.[55]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
