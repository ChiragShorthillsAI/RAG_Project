Gretel & Hansel(also known asGretel & Hansel: A Grim Fairy Tale) is a 2020dark fantasyhorror filmdirected byOsgood Perkinsand written by Rob Hayes, based on the German fairy tale "Hansel and Gretel" by theBrothers Grimm.Sophia Lillisand Sam Leakey portray the titular characters, withAlice KrigeandJessica De Gouwalso starring. The film follows the siblings Gretel and Hansel as they become lost in the forest and then stumble upon the home of awitch.
Gretel & Hanselwas released in the United States on 31 January 2020, byUnited Artists Releasing. The film grossed $22.3 million worldwide against a $5 million production budget and received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its visuals and cinematography as well as the horror elements and acting, but criticism for its pacing and screenplay.
The prologue opens with a story about "A Beautiful Child with a Pretty Pink Hat". A father takes his mortally ill baby daughter to be cured by a witch, who performs healing spells, bestowing supernatural abilities on the child in the process. As the girl grows up, the villagers come to hear her premonitions, but her wicked nature is soon revealed when she begins murdering innocent people, including her own father. The girl is then abandoned in the woods, where she lures children to their death.
The scene shifts to teenage Gretel (who is implied also to possess supernatural abilities and powers) and her younger brother, Hansel. As their father dies, their mother sends them out to find work. Gretel is offered a housekeeping job but turns it down when the master of the house asks about her virginity. Their mother rebukes Gretel for failing to provide for them and threatens to kill both children if they do not leave the house.
The siblings flee and find temporary accommodation for the night, but aghoulishman appears and attacks Hansel. A huntsman saves the children and takes them to his home for the night, before sending them off to find work the next morning. They get lost in the woods and, suffering from hunger, are attracted by the scent of baked cake to a hut in the forest, in which a woman named Holda lives. She invites the children in for a meal and allows them to stay, in exchange for performing work around the house. Hansel is sent into the woods to practice woodcutting with an axe, while Gretel assists with housekeeping. Hansel is happy with their new home, but Gretel is suspicious of Holda and troubled by disturbing visions and nightmares. Sensing Gretel's abilities, Holda initiates her intowitchcraftand teaches her to levitate her wooden staff with the aid offlying ointment.
Hansel soon becomes wary of Holda after discovering asatanicpentagramcarved into a tree. The siblings have an argument that night, and Hansel leaves the hut and is then lured into a trap by Holda. Gretel confronts the witch, who insists she is doing Gretel a favour by getting rid of Hansel. It is then revealed that Holda was the mother of the wicked girl from the prologue story; Holda loathed her daughter for killing her husband. After exiling her daughter into the woods, Holda was haunted by the girl's spirit into eating her other children to gain the same powers. Holda has been luring the children lost in the forest to their death in the guise of an elderly woman ever since.
Holda drugs Gretel and straps her down in the cellar, where she plans for Hansel to be eaten. Now in the form of a young woman, Holda lures Hansel into a cage atop a large fire pit so she can cook him. Gretel manages to free herself and uses flying ointment on her hands and face to levitate a wooden staff and pin Holda against the wall, where she slowly burns to death over the fire, which brings Hansel to from his drugged state.
The next morning, Gretel assures her brother that Holda is gone for good and sends him back home (their mother is implied to have died in the meantime and Hansel should be able to start working at home as a woodsman). Gretel stays behind to hone her craft. She sees the ghosts of the children murdered by Holda, now finally free to pass on.
In the closing moments, her fingertips begin to turn black, just as Holda's had been.
In October 2018, theHollywood Reporterwrote thatOrion Pictureshad started developing a film adaptation of the German folklore taleHansel and Gretel, withOz Perkinsdirecting a screenplay he had co-written with Rob Hayes, andSophia Lillisstarring as the lead character.[7]Sinisterproducer Brian Kavanaugh-Jones andThe Autopsy of Jane DoeproducerFred Berger, partners at Automatik Entertainment, were announced as producers, with Sandra Yee Ling and Macdara Kelleher as executive producers.[5]Hayes eventually received sole screenplay credit.
In November 2018,Charles Babalolawas cast as the Hunter, a new character who helps Gretel and Hansel navigate the woods.[6]In April 2019,Alice Krige,Jessica De Gouw, and Sam Leakey joined the cast, with Leakey making his acting debut.[5]
Perkins explained in an interview that the title was changed because this version focuses on Gretel:
"It's awfully faithful to the original story. It's got really only three principal characters: Hansel, Gretel, and the Witch. We tried to find a way to make it more of a coming of age story. I wanted Gretel to be somewhat older than Hansel, so it didn't feel like two 12-year-olds – rather a 16-year-old and an 8-year-old. There was more of a feeling like Gretel having to take Hansel around everywhere she goes, and how that can impede one's own evolution, how our attachments and the things that we love can sometimes get in the way of our growth."[8]
Principal photographyon the film began on 9 November 2018 inDublin, Ireland, and wrapped up in December 2018.[9]Additional filming and reshoots started in January 2019 inLangley, British Columbia,Canada.
The score was composed byRobin Coudert, also known by his stage name, Rob. With the soundtrack in mind, Rob avoided using typical symphonic orchestral themes to create a unique film score saying, “I find it essential to create melodies that we can sing or whistle as, in horror cinema, it is usually the opposite, where the music rather has a tendency toward structure and abstraction. For this project, which is a film about kids, it seemed important to have that.” The soundtrack was released byWaxwork Recordsin 2020 as a single LP.[10]
The film was released on 31 January 2020 by United Artists.[5]
Warner Bros. Home Entertainmentreleased the film digitally on 7 April 2020, and on DVD and Blu-ray on 5 May 2020.[11]
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongsideThe Rhythm Section, and was projected to gross $4–7 million from 3,000 theaters in its opening weekend.[12][1]The film made $2.3 million on its first day (including $475,000 from Thursday night previews). It debuted to $6.1 million, finishing fourth.[13]
OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 63% based on 112 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "Gretel & Hansel's rich visuals satisfy, even if this adaptation of a classic fairytale gets a little lost in the woods on the storytelling front."[14]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[15]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "C−" on an A+ to F scale.[13]
Contrarily, Andrew Barker ofVarietywrote, "The film certainly looks nice, with a wealth of eye-catching compositions," but added, "The problem is that so many of its virtues feel compromised."  Kimber Myers wrote forThe Los Angeles Times, "While [Perkins] offers a stunning feast for the eyes, the substance is likely to leave viewers still hungry."[16]
Chandler Levack fromThe Globe and Mailwrote, "Everything aboutGretel & Hanselis weirder, smarter and way more cinematic than I'd expected, thanks to some fascinating movie choices made by director Oz Perkins." Kate Rife fromThe A.V. Clubwrote, "If one of the boundaries being tested in this film is viewers' patience, the reward for—to use a refrain repeated throughout the film—'trusting the darkness' is well worth the commitment." Frank Sheck ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote, "Gretel & Hanselmay alienate some horror movie fans with its extremely leisurely pacing and emphasis on atmosphere and mood rather than visceral shocks. But while the film certainly demands patience, it provides ample rewards with its lush stylization."
Mark Kennedy of theAssociated Presswrote, "Gretel & Hanselis as visually arresting as it is tedious, a 90-minute movie that really should have been a 3-minute music video forMarilyn MansonorOzzy Osbourne. It's in the horror genre only loosely. It's more eerie, if that's a genre. Actually, it's like dread for 90 minutes. It's dreadful."  Jeannette Catsoulis ofThe New York Timeslabeled the film "Essentially the story of a young woman coming into her power,Gretel & Hanselis quietly sinister, yet too underdeveloped to truly scare."[17]

Orion Releasing, LLC(doing business asOrion Pictures) is an Americanfilm productionanddistributioncompany owned by theAmazon MGM Studiossubsidiary ofAmazon.
It was founded in 1978 asOrion Pictures Corporation, ajoint venturebetweenWarner Bros.and three former senior executives atUnited Artists(UA). The company produced and released films from 1978 through 1999 and was also involved in television production and syndication in the 1980s and early 1990s. It was one of the largest mini-major studios during its early years, when it worked with prominent directors such asWoody Allen,James Cameron,Jonathan Demme, andOliver Stone.[3]Four films distributed by Orion wonAcademy AwardsforBest Picture:Amadeus(1984),Platoon(1986),Dances with Wolves(1990), andThe Silence of the Lambs(1991).[4]
In 1997, Orion was acquired byMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM), which revived the Orion name for television in 2013 and relaunched Orion Pictures a year later. In 2022, Amazon acquired Orion when it acquired MGM.
On February 6, 1978, three executives ofTransamerica(TA)-owned studioUnited Artists(UA)—Arthur B. Krim(chairman),Eric Pleskow(president and chief executive officer), andRobert Benjamin(chairman of the finance committee)—quit their jobs. Krim and Benjamin had headed UA since 1951 and subsequently turned around the then-flailing studio with a number of critical and commercial successes. Change had begun once Transamerica purchased UA in 1967 and, within a decade, a rift formed between Krim and Transamerica chairmanJohn R. Beckettconcerning the studio's operations. Krim suggested spinning off UA into a separate company which was rejected by Beckett.[5]
The last straw came for Pleskow when he refused to collect and deliver the medical records of UA department heads to Transamerica's offices in San Francisco for the sake of confidentiality. The tensions only worsened whenFortunemagazine reported an article on the clash between UA and TA in which Beckett had stated that, if the executives disliked the parent company's treatment of them, they should resign.[5]Krim, Benjamin and Pleskow quit UA on January 13, 1978, followed by the exits of senior vice presidents William Bernstein andMike Medavoythree days later. The week following the resignations, according to the websiteReference for Business, 63 important Hollywood figures took out an advertisement in a trade paper warning Transamerica that it had made a fatal mistake in letting the five men leave. The 'fatal mistake' came true following the box-office disaster ofHeaven's Gate[6]in 1980 which led to Transamerica selling UA toMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM).[7]
That same year, the five men forged a deal withWarner Bros.[8]The executives formed Orion Pictures Company, named afterthe constellationwhich they claimed had five main stars (it actually has seven or eight). The new company intended only to finance projects, giving the filmmakers complete creative autonomy; this ideal had been successfully implemented at United Artists. Orion held a $100 million line of credit and its films would be distributed by theWarner Bros.studio. Orion, however, was contractually given free rein over distribution and advertising as well as the number and type of films the executives chose to invest in.[9]
In late March 1978, Orion signed its first contract, a two-picture deal withJohn Travolta's production company. Contracts with actress and directorBarbra Streisand; actorsJames Caan,Jane Fonda,Peter Sellers,Jon Voight, andBurt Reynolds; directorsFrancis Ford CoppolaandBlake Edwards; writer/directorJohn Milius; singerPeter Frampton; and producerRay Starksoon materialized.[6][10]Orion also developed a co-financing and distribution deal withEMI Films.[6]In its first year, Orion had fifteen films in production and had a dozen more actors, directors and producers lining up to sign with them.[6]
In October 1979, Benjamin died.[11]Orion's first film,A Little Romance,[12]was released in April that year. Later that year, Orion releasedBlake Edwards'10which became a commercial success, the first for Edwards in over a decade (aside from installments ofThe Pink Pantherfranchise). Other films released by Orion over the next two years included a few successes such asCaddyshack(1980) andArthur(1981); critically praised but underperforming films such asThe Great Santini(1979), an adaptation of aPat Conroynovel, andSidney Lumet'sPrince of the City(1981); and pictures by young writer-directors such asPhilip Kaufman'sThe Wanderers(1979) andNicholas Meyer's debutTime After Time(1979); plusMonty Python's Life of Brian(1979) which Orion only distributed in the United States. Out of the 23 films Orion released between April 1979 and December 1981, only a third of them made a profit.[13]Orion executives were conflicted over financing big-budgeted films and passed onRaiders of the Lost Ark(1981) for that reason.[14]
By early 1982, Orion had severed its distribution ties with Warner Bros. As part of the deal, the rights to Orion's films made up to that point were sold to Warner Bros. Orion was now looking to have its own distribution network by acquiring another company with such capabilities. The four partners looked intoAllied ArtistsandEmbassy Pictures[15]before settling onFilmways.[16]Orion subsequently purchased Filmways and reorganized the flailing company. New employees were hired and all of Filmways' non-entertainment assets (Grosset & DunlapandBroadcast Electronics) were sold off.[6][16]
Another result of the merger was that Orion entered television production. Orion's biggest TV hit wasCagney & Lacey, which lasted seven seasons onCBS. In 1983, Orion Pictures introduced art-house divisionOrion Classicswith executives who had previously runUnited Artists Classics.[16][17]
Out of the initial 18 films released by the firm under the name of Orion Pictures Corporation, ten made profits, five just managed to cover their costs, and three suffered losses under $2 million.[6]One such film,Francis Ford Coppola'sThe Cotton Club, was mired in legal troubles and Orion lost $3 million of its investment.[6]"We've had some singles and doubles [but haven't] had any home runs," lamented Krim.[6]In September 1984, Orion distributedAmadeus, which garnered many accolades, winning eightAcademy Awards, includingBest Picture.[6]That year, on April 3, 1984, Orion Pictures launched Orion Entertainment Group, that would consist of four groups, Orion Television, Orion Home Video, Orion Pay Television and Orion Television Syndication, and the new organization would produce and distribute product for television, home video, pay and syndicated markets, withJamie Kellnerserving as president.[18]On October 26, 1984, the company released theJames Cameron-directedscience fiction filmThe Terminatorwhich was well received by critics and audience and led to a franchise involving five further films. However, Orion distributed none of the follow-ups.
For Orion, 1985 was a dismal year. All but two films,Desperately Seeking SusanandCode of Silence, made less than $10 million at the United States box office, including an unsuccessful attempt at aJames Bond-type franchise,Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins.[6]Orion's haphazard distribution channels and unsuccessful advertising campaigns made it impossible to achieve a hit. Another factor was that Orion was about to venture into the video business and stopped selling home-use rights to its films. Furthermore, the production of theRodney DangerfieldcomedyBack to Schoolwas put on hold when a co-producer died, taking the film off of its Christmas 1985 release slate.[19]
In January 1986,Mario KassarandAndrew Vajna, producers of theRambofilms (the first film,First Blood, was distributed by Orion) attempted to buy $55 million worth of the studio's stock through the duo's company,Anabasis. Had they succeeded, Kassar and Vajna would have controlled the board and laid off every executive save for Krim.[19]Warburg Pincus subsequently limited its 20% stake in Orion to 5%; the remaining stock was acquired byViacom International.[6]Viacom hoped to use Orion's product for its pay-TV channelShowtime.[20]Orion expanded into home video distribution with the formation of Orion Home Entertainment Corporation in 1985,[21]which began distributing videos under theOrion Home Videolabel in 1987 (before OHV's formation,HBO Videoand their predecessors, as well as former Orion's partnerWarner Home Video,Vestron VideoandEmbassy Home Entertainment, had been responsible for home media releases of Orion product).[6]
On May 22, 1986, a 6.5% stake in Orion was purchased byMetromedia, a television and communications company controlled by billionaire (and a friend of Krim's)John Kluge. Metromedia had just divested its television station group toRupert Murdoch'sNews Corporation(which would form what is now theFox network). Kluge's investment in Orion came at the right time;Back to Schoolwas a success that earned $90 million at the box office.[6]By March 1987, the studio's fortunes had increased dramatically with a succession of critical and commercial hits, includingPlatoon(which ultimately won a Best Picture Oscar), Woody Allen'sHannah and Her Sisters, and the sports filmHoosiers. Orion's 1986 offerings drew 18 Academy Award nominations, more than any other studio.[6]In 1987, Orion achieved further success withRoboCopandNo Way Out.[6]By this time, Orion's television division had expanded into the lucrative syndicated game show market under the name Century Towers Productions, a reference to Orion's street address. It produced revivals of format inherited fromHeatter-Quigley Productions, owned since the late 1960s by Filmways; this includedThe New Hollywood Squares, which ran from 1986 to 1989, and a revival ofHigh Rollersthat aired in the 1987–88 season. 1987 also saw the arrival of formerCBS/Fox Videoexecutive Len White, who became president and CEO of Orion Home Video, with plans to release its first home video titles in the third or fourth quarter of that year; he reported to Larry Hilford, who joined the home video division two years earlier.[22]
In January 1987, Kluge faced competition with the arrival ofSumner Redstone, whose theater chain,National Amusements, purchased 6.42 percent of Orion's stock. National Amusements later acquired Viacom, increasing their Orion stake to 21%, then 26%. Soon Kluge started buying more Orion stock, touching off a battle with Redstone over control of the company.[23][24]Kluge won on May 20, 1988, when Metromedia took over about 67% of Orion.[6]One analyst toldThe Wall Street Journal: "This amount is probably so small to Kluge it doesn't matter. He probably burns that up in a weekend."[6]
In 1989, Orion suffered from a disastrous slate of films, placing dead last among larger Hollywood studios by box office revenue. Among its biggest flops that year wereGreat Balls of Fire!, a biography ofJerry Lee LewisstarringDennis QuaidandWinona Ryder;She-Devil, a dark comedy starringMeryl StreepandRoseanne Barr;Speed Zone, an action-comedy vehicle forSCTValumniJohn Candy,Joe Flaherty, andEugene Levy; andMiloš Forman's adaptation ofLes Liaisons dangereuses,Valmont, which competed withDangerous Liaisons, also based on the same source material. Test screenings of the"Weird Al" YankoviccomedyUHFwere so strong that Orion had high expectations for it, but it flopped at the box office (though it later developed a cult following on video).[6][25]Also that year, it signed a deal withNelson Entertainmentto distribute titles on videocassette and theatrically.[26][27]
In February 1990, Orion signed a deal withColumbia Pictures Entertainmentin which the much larger studio would pay Orion $175 million to distribute Orion's movies and television programs overseas. Orion had previously licensed its films to individual distributors territory by territory.[6]That same month, Mike Medavoy left Orion and became head ofTri-Star Pictures.[28]
The box-office returns for Orion's 1990 releases were just as dismal, with failures inThe Hot SpotandState of Grace. The only bright spot wasKevin Costner's western epicDances with Wolves,which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture,[29]and grossed $400 million worldwide. A few months later, Orion garnered another winner withThe Silence of the Lambs, but these two films could not make up for years of losses. Only Kluge's continued infusions of cash were enough to keep the company afloat, but soon he had enough.
Kluge first attempted to sell Orion to businessman (and former20th Century Foxowner)Marvin Davis.Sony, which had recently purchasedColumbia Pictures, was also interested.[30]When those talks fell through, Kluge took drastic steps. First, Orion shut down production. Second, Kluge ordered the sale of several projects, such asThe Addams Family(which went toParamount, though the international rights to the film were retained by Orion), in order to accumulate much-needed cash. Finally, in the spring of 1991, Kluge's people took over the company, leading to the departure of Arthur Krim.[31]Orion's financial problems were so severe, that at the 63rd Annual Academy Awards in March 1991, hostBilly Crystalmade reference to Orion's debt in his opening monologue, joking that "Reversal of Fortune[is] about a woman in a coma,Awakenings[is] about a man in a coma; andDances with Wolves[was] released by Orion, a studio in a coma."[32]
It was during this time thatABCstepped in to co-finance and assume production over many of Orion TV's shows it had in production, such asAmerican DetectiveandEqual Justice. After Orion had to shut the television division down, this resulted in projects likeThe Chuck Woolery Show, which was planned to be produced by Orion, instead having to find new production companies (such asGroup W Productionsin the case of Woolery).[33]Gary Nardino, former employee of Orion Television Entertainment, moved on to producing forLorimar Television, taking some of Orion's projects with him, includingBill & Ted's Excellent AdventuresonFox, andHearts are Wild, a co-production withSpelling Television, forCBS; talent deals Orion Television had at the time (withThomas Carter,Robert Townsend, Paul Stajonovich, Clifton Campbell andDeborah Joy Levine) were also taken by Nardino to Lorimar.[34]On November 25, 1991, Orion sold itsHollywood Squaresformat rights toKing World Productionsafter Orion closed down its television division.[35]
On December 11, 1991, Orion filed forChapter 11 bankruptcyprotection.[6]That same month, Orion was in talks withNew Line Cinema, a successful independent film company, to acquire the bankrupt studio. By the following April, Orion and New Line Cinema cancelled their plans on the issue of price.Republic Picturesand the then-newSavoy Picturesalso attempted to buy Orion, but no deal materialized.[36][37]
In February 1992, Bernstein, who was president and chief executive of Orion at that point, resigned from the studio, Bernstein would go on to become executive vice president at Paramount Pictures.[38][39]
At the Academy Awards ceremony, broadcast on March 30, 1992, Crystal made another reference to Orion, this time about its demise:
Take a great studio like Orion: a few years ago Orion releasedPlatoon, it wins Best Picture.Amadeus, Best Picture. Last year, they releasedDances with Wolveswins Best Picture. This yearThe Silence of the Lambsis nominated for Best Picture. And they can't afford to have another hit! But there is good news and bad news. The good news is that Orion was just purchased, and the bad news is it was bought by the House of Representatives.[40]
The Silence of the Lambsswept all five major Academy Awards; however, a majority of key executives, as well as the talent they had deals with, had left the studio. Hollywood observers had doubts that Orion would be resurrected to its former glory.[41]
In May 1992, it was reported that Pleskow was resigning from Orion on July 1 of that year.[42]stating in the New York Times: "There is little for me to do at this point".[43]
On November 5, 1992, Orion reemerged from bankruptcy. Its reorganization plan would allow for Orion to continue producing and releasing films, but financing for the features would be provided by outside sources, with the studio purchasing the distribution rights to them after their completion.[44][45]
Orion's bankruptcy also delayed the release of many films the studio had produced or acquired, among them:Love Field(1992),RoboCop 3(1993),The Dark Half(1993),Blue Sky(1994),Car 54, Where Are You?(1994),Clifford(1994),The Favor(1994), andThere Goes My Baby(1994). Orion started releasing these films after their reorganization.Blue Skywon starJessica Langean Academy Award for Best Actress in 1995.
In August 1994, Orion Home Video partnered withStreamline Picturesin distributing the latter's licensedanimevideo titles to general retailers, which animation historianFred Pattenconsidered a major development in anime's growing popularity in Americanpop culture.[46]
In November 1995, Orion, two other companies controlled by Kluge, and film and TV houseMCEGSterling (producer of theLook Who's Talkingseries) were merged to form the Metromedia International Group.[47]Few of the films released during the four years afterbankruptcy protectionwere successful either critically or commercially.
In 1996, Metromedia acquired production companyMotion Picture Corporation of America, and installed its heads, Brad Krevoy and Steve Stabler, as co-presidents of Orion. Both received a six picture put picture distribution deal as a part of their contracts.[48]
In the years ahead, Orion produced very few films, and primarily released films from other producers, includingLIVE Entertainment.Orion Classics, minus its founders (who had moved toSony Pictures Entertainmentand foundedSony Pictures Classics), continued to acquire popularart-housefilms, such asBoxing Helena(1993), before Metromedia merged the subsidiary withSamuel Goldwyn Entertainmentin 1996.
In July 1997, Metromedia shareholders approved the sale of Orion Pictures (as well as Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment andMotion Picture Corporation of America) toMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM). This led to the withdrawal of 85 employees, including Krevoy and Stabler, while 111 other employees were to be laid off within nine months, leaving 25 of them to work at MGM. Orion Pictures also brought with it a two-thousand film library, ten completed movies and five direct-to-video features for future release[49]and the Krevoy and Stabler movie put picture distribution deal.[48]Krevoy and Stabler retained the right to the Motion Picture Corporation of America name and their three top movies. Metromedia retained Goldwyn Entertainment's Landmark Theatre Group.[49]One Man's Hero(1999) was the last film released by Orion Pictures for 15 years.
MGM kept Orion Pictures intact as a corporation, mostly to avoid its home video distribution agreement withWarner Home Videoand began distributing Orion Pictures films under the Orion Home Video label. MGM acquired the two thirds of the pre-1996PolyGram Filmed Entertainmentlibrary (which included theEpic film library) fromSeagramin 1999 for $250 million, increasing their library holdings to 4,000. The PolyGram libraries were purchased by its Orion Pictures subsidiary so as to avoid its 1990 home video distribution agreement with Warner Home Video.[50]In March 1999, MGM bought out its distribution contract with Warner Home Video for $225 million, effectively ending the distribution problem.[51]
In 2013, Orion returned to television production (after its original TV unit was shut down during its bankruptcy period) with a new syndicatedcourt show,Paternity Court.[52]
The Orion Pictures name, also as Orion Releasing, was extended in fourth quarter 2014 for smaller multi-platform video on demand and limited theatrical distribution. Its name was first seen again on September 10, 2014, in front of the trailer forThe Town That Dreaded Sundownthat was released in October. The label's first release was the Brazilian filmVestido pra Casar.[53]
In September 2015,Entertainment One Filmsrelaunched theMomentum Picturesbanner with an announced deal with Orion Pictures to co-acquire and co-distribute films in the United States and Canada, and selected foreign markets, such as theUnited Kingdom(Momentum's country of origin). The initial films under the deal wereThe Wannabe,Fort TildenandBalls Out.[54]Other films released by Orion Pictures andMomentum PicturesincludePocket ListingandDiablo.[55][56][57]
Starting in September 2016 withBurn Country, Orion Pictures andSamuel Goldwyn Filmspaired in acquiring several films.[58][59][60][61]
Orion Television launched a second court show in the fall of 2017,Couples Court With The Cutlers, which features married couple Keith and Dana Cutler presiding over romantic and domestic disputes.[62]
On September 6, 2017, MGM officially revitalized the Orion Pictures brand as a standalone, US theatrical marketing and distribution arm with the hiring of John Hegeman, who joined fromBlumhouse Tilt(distributor of Orion'sThe Town That Dreaded SundownandThe Belko Experiment) and incidentally got his start at the original Orion in the 1980s. Hegeman would serve as president of the expanded label and report toJonathan Glickman, president of MGM's motion picture group. Under his leadership, the "new" Orion will produce, market and distribute four to six modestly budgeted films a year across genres and platforms, and both wide and limited releases for targeted audiences. Its first release, the young adult romance dramaEvery Day, was released on February 23, 2018.[4][63][64][65]
In May 2018, it was announced thatOrion Classicswould be revived as a multiplatform distribution label, with 8 to 10 films being released per year.[66]
On February 5, 2019, MGM andAnnapurna Picturesexpanded their US joint distribution venture Mirror, rebranding it asUnited Artists Releasing. Beginning in April 2019, Orion Pictures' upcoming titles would be distributed through the UAR banner and Orion's theatrical distribution staff will move to UAR.[67]The first Orion film to do so was the remake ofChild's Play,[68]which was released on June 21, 2019.
On August 20, 2020, it was announced that Orion would be relaunched again, with its focus shifting to films made by underrepresented filmmakers (including people of color, women, theLGBTcommunity and people with disabilities) as part of the efforts to increase inclusivity in the film industry, both in front of and behind the camera, with the hiring of Alana Mayo as the president, replacing Hegeman by October.[1][2]The first film released with this new focus wasAnything's Possible(previously titledWhat If?), a coming-of-age drama directed byBilly Porterin hisdirectorial debut.[69]This effort continued in 2021 when they, along with Annapurna, acquired the US distribution rights toOn the Count of Threetwo weeks after it premiered at the2021 Sundance Film Festival.[70]
On May 17, 2021, online shopping companyAmazonentered negotiations to acquire MGM and even made a bid for about $9 billion, with the intention to own the studio's library, including Orion's films, to grow theAmazon Prime Videocatalog. The negotiations were made withAnchorage CapitalKevin Ulrich.[71][72]On May 26, 2021, it was officially announced that MGM would be acquired by Amazon for $8.45 billion.[73]The merger was finalized on March 17, 2022.[74]

Almost all of Orion's post-1982 releases, as well as most of the AIP and Filmways backlogs and all of the television output originally produced and distributed by Orion Television, now bear the MGM name. However, in most cases, the 1980s Orion logo has been retained or added, in the case of the Filmways and AIP libraries.
Most ancillary rights to Orion's back catalog from the 1978–1982 joint venture period remain with Warner Bros., including such films as10(1979),Caddyshack(1980),Arthur(1981),Excalibur(1981), andPrince of the City(1981). Some post-1982 films originally released by Orion—Lionheart(1987),The Unbearable Lightness of Being(1988), andAmadeus(1984) (the latter two beingSaul Zaentzproductions)—are currently distributed by Warner Bros. as well.HBOalso owns video distribution rights toThree Amigos(1986), as they co-produced the film and owns pay-TV rights. However, MGM owns all other rights and the film's copyright.[citation needed]The Wanderersis owned by the film's producers; however, the copyright is held by MGM/Orion. Orion also retains a controlling interest inThe Cotton Club, although major rights are now withLionsgate, which owns the library of presenting studioZoetrope Corporation.
Woody Allen's filmsA Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy(1982) andZelig(1983) are the only Orion films from the original joint venture period now owned by MGM, as the rights for them remained with Allen, who sold them to MGM in 2000.[79]Orion releases produced by theHemdale Film CorporationandNelson Entertainmentare included in MGM's library as well, and are incorporated into the Orion library. MGM did not acquire the Hemdale films (which includeThe Terminator,Hoosiers, andPlatoon) or the Nelson films (including theBill & Tedfilms) until MGM bought the pre-1996 library of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment (the "Epic library"), which included both companies' libraries, although the television and digital rights to certain Nelson films are now held byParamount Television(the result of a pre-existing deal Nelson had with Viacom), with television syndication handled on behalf of Paramount Television byTrifecta Entertainment & Media.
Many of the film and television holdings ofThe Samuel Goldwyn Companyhave now also been incorporated into the Orion library (with ownership currently held by MGM), and the copyright on some of this material is held by Orion, exceptThe New Adventures of Flippernow carries the MGM Television Entertainment copyright.[citation needed]
MGM still holds distribution rights to the 1980s revival ofHollywood SquaresandHigh Rollersthe company produced, as well as the remnants of the Heatter-Quigley library that was not erased, including all remaining episodes of the originalSquares; they do not own the rights to the format, which is currently owned byCBS Television Distribution, successor-in-interest to King World, who purchased the format rights in 1991 and produced another syndicated revival from 1998 to 2004.
Orion distributed the firstRambo film,First Blood(1982).[80]That film, like the rest of theRambofranchise, is now owned byStudioCanalas a result of purchasing the library of its co-distributor,Carolco Pictures.[81]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
