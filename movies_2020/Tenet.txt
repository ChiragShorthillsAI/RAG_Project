Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]

Michael Caine was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite atSt Olave's Hospitalin theRotherhithedistrict of London on 14 March 1933,[10][11][12][13]the son of cook andcharwomanEllen Frances Marie (née Burchell; 1901–1989)[14][15]and afish marketporter also called Maurice Joseph Micklewhite (1899–1956). His father was from aCatholicIrish Travellerfamily background.[16]Caine was raised in his mother'sProtestantfaith.[17]He had a younger brother,Stanley(1935–2013), who also became an actor, and an older maternal half-brother named David Burchell. He grew up in London'sSouthwarkdistrict; during theSecond World War, he wasevacuated100 miles (160 km) toNorth Runcton, Norfolk, where he made his acting debut at the village school and had a pet horse called Lottie.[18][19]
After the war, Caine's father wasdemobilisedand the family were rehoused by the council in Marshall Gardens in London'sElephant and Castlearea, where they lived in aprefabricated housemade in Canada[20]as much of London's housing stock had been destroyed duringthe Blitzin 1940 and 1941. Caine later wrote in his autobiography, "The prefabs, as they were known, were intended to be temporary homes while London was reconstructed, but we ended up living there for eighteen years—and for us, after a cramped flat with an outside toilet, it was luxury."[21]
At the age of 10, Caine acted in a school play as the father of the ugly sisters inCinderella. His trousers' zipper was undone, prompting the audience to laugh, which inspired him to pursue an acting career.[22]In 1944, he passed hiseleven-plusexamination, winning a scholarship toHackney Downs School.[23]After a year there, he moved toWilson's SchoolinCamberwell, which he left at age 16 after gainingSchool Certificatesin six subjects. He then worked briefly as a filing clerk and messenger for a film company inVictoriaand film producerJay LewisonWardour Street.[24]
In 1952, Caine wascalled upto do hisnational service. Between 1952 and 1954 he served in theBritish Army'sRoyal Fusiliers, first at theBritish Army of the RhineHeadquarters inIserlohn,West Germany, and then on active service in theKorean War.
Caine, seeing first-hand how the Chinese usedhuman wavetactics, was left with the sense that thecommunistgovernment did not care about its citizens. Having been previously sympathetic towards the ideals of communism, Caine was left repelled by it.[25]He experienced a situation in which he thought he was going to die, the memory of which stayed with him and "formed his character". In his 2010 autobiographyThe Elephant to Hollywood, he wrote that "The rest of my life I have lived every bloody moment from the moment I wake up until the time I go to sleep."[26][27][28][29]
Caine has said that he would like to see the return of national service in Britain, to help combatyouth violence, stating: "I'm just saying, put them in the Army for six months. You're there to learn how to defend your country. You belong to the country. Then, when you come out, you have a sense of belonging, rather than a sense of violence."[30]
Caine's film debut was an uncreditedwalk-onrole inMorning Departure(1950). A few years later inHorsham, Sussex, he responded to an advertisement inThe Stagefor an assistant stage manager who would also perform bit parts for the Horsham-based Westminster Repertory Company, who were performing at theCarfaxElectric Theatre.[31]Adopting the stage name "Michael White", in July 1953 he was cast as the drunkard Hindley in the company's production ofWuthering Heights.[32][33][clarification needed]He moved to theLowestoftRepertory Company inSuffolkfor a year when he was 21. It was here that he met his first wife,Patricia Haines.[34]He has described the first nine years of his career as "really, really brutal"[35]as well as "more like purgatory than paradise".[18]He appeared in nine plays during his time at the Lowestoft Rep at the Arcadia Theatre with Jackson Stanley's Standard Players.
When his career took him to London in 1954 after his provincial apprenticeship, his agent informed him that there was already a Michael White performing as an actor in London and that he had to come up with a new name immediately.[32]Speaking to his agent from atelephone boothinLeicester Square, London, he looked around for inspiration, noted thatThe Caine Mutinywas being shown at theOdeon Cinema, and decided to change his name to "Michael Caine".[32]He joked on television in 1987 that, had a tree partly blocking his view been a few feet to the left, he might have been called "Michael Mutiny". He also later joked in interviews that, had he looked the other way, he would have ended up as "MichaelOne Hundred and One Dalmatians".[36]In 1958, Caine played the minor role of a court orderly in a BBC Television adaptation of the story,The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial.[37]
Caine moved in with another rising cockney actor,Terence Stamp, and began hanging out with him andPeter O'Toolein the London party scene after he had become O'Toole'sunderstudyinLindsay Anderson'sWest Endstaging ofWillis Hall'sThe Long and the Short and the Tallin 1959.[32]Caine took over the role when O'Toole left to makeLawrence of Arabiaand went on to a four-month tour of the UK and Ireland.[32]Caine's first film role was as one of the privates inGeorge Baker's platoon in the 1956 filmA Hill in Korea. The stars of the film were Baker,Harry Andrews,Stanley BakerandMichael Medwin, withStephen BoydandRonald Lewis;Robert Shawalso had a small part. Caine also appeared regularly on television in small roles. His first credited role on the BBC was in 1956, where he played Boudousse in theJean AnouilhplayThe Lark. Other parts included three roles inDixon of Dock Greenin 1957, 1958 and 1959, prisoner-of-war seriesEscape(1957), and the crime/thriller dramaMister Charlesworth(1958).
Caine continued to appear on television, in serialsThe Golden GirlandNo Wreath for the General, but was then cast in the playThe Compartment, written byJohnny Speight, atwo-handeralso starringFrank Finlay. This was followed by main roles in other plays including the character Tosh inSomewhere for the Night, aSunday-Night Playwritten byBill Naughtontelevised on Sunday 3 December 1961, another two-hander by Johnny Speight,The Playmates, and two editions of BBC plays strandFirst Night,Funny Noises with Their MouthsandThe Way with Reggie(both 1963). He also acted in radio plays, includingBill Naughton'sLooking for Frankieon theBBC Home Service(1963). A big break came for Caine when he was cast as Meff inJames Saunders'CockneycomedyNext Time I'll Sing To You, when this play was presented at theNew Arts Theatrein London on 23 January 1963.[38]Scenes from the play's performance were featured in the April 1963 issue ofTheatre Worldmagazine.[39]
When this play moved to theCriterioninPiccadillywithMichael Codrondirecting, he was visited backstage byStanley Baker, one of the four stars in Caine's first film,A Hill in Korea, who told him about the part of a Cockney private in his upcoming filmZulu, a film Baker was producing and starring in. Baker told Caine to meet the director,Cy Endfield, who informed him that he already had given the part toJames Booth, a fellow Cockney who was Caine's friend, because he "looked more Cockney" than Caine did. Endfield then told the 6'2" Caine that he did not look like a Cockney but like an officer, and offered him a screen test for the role of a snobbish, upper class officer after Caine assured him that he could do aposh accent. Caine believes Endfield offered him, a Cockney, the role of an aristocrat because, being American, he did not have the endemic British class-prejudice. Though he tested poorly, Endfield gave him the part that would make him a film star.[40]
Location shooting forZulutook place inNatal, South Africa, for 14 weeks in 1963.[41][42][43]According to his 2010 autobiographyThe Elephant to Hollywood, Caine had been signed to a seven-year contract byJoseph E. Levine, whoseEmbassy Filmswas distributingZulu. After the return of the cast to England and the completion of the film, Levine released him from the contract, telling him, "I know you're not, but you gotta face the fact that you look like a queer on screen." Levine gave his contract to hisZuluco-star James Booth.[44]Subsequently, Caine's agent got him cast in the BBC productionHamlet at Elsinore(1964) asHoratio, in support ofChristopher Plummer'sHamlet. Horatio was the only classical role which Caine, who had never received dramatic training, would ever play. Caine wrote, "...I decided that if my on-screen appearance was going to be an issue, then I would use it to bring out all Horatio's ambiguous sexuality."[45]
Caine's roles as effete-seeming aristocrats were to contrast with his next projects, in which he was to become notable for using aregional accent, rather than theReceived Pronunciationthen considered proper for film actors. At that time his working-classCockneyspeech stood out to American and British audiences alike, as didthe Beatles'Liverpudlianaccents.Zuluwas followed by two of Caine's best-known roles: the rough-edged petty-crook-turned-spyHarry PalmerinThe Ipcress File(1965) and the titular womanising young Cockney inAlfie(1966). In a 2016 interview Caine citedAlfieas his favourite film of his career, saying, "it made me a star in America as well, and it was my first nomination for an Academy Award".[46]He went on to play Harry Palmer in a further four films,Funeral in Berlin(1966),Billion Dollar Brain(1967),Bullet to Beijing(1995) andMidnight in Saint Petersburg(1996).[47]Caine made his first film in Hollywood in 1966, after an invitation fromShirley MacLaineto play opposite her inGambit. During the first two weeks, whilst staying atthe Beverly Hills Hotel, he met long-term friendsJohn Wayneand agent"Swifty" Lazar. Wayne was a fan of Caine's performance inAlfieand suggested to Caine, "Speak slow and speak low". Caine was always grateful for that advice.[48]Caine starred in the filmThe Magus(1968) which, althoughBAFTA-nominated for Best Cinematography, failed at the box office.
Caine starred in the 1969 comedycaper filmThe Italian Jobas Charlie Croker, the leader of a Cockney criminal gang released from prison with the intention of doing a "big job" in Italy to steal gold bullion from an armoured security truck. One of the most celebrated roles of his career, in a 2002 poll his line "You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!" was voted the second-funniest line in film (after "He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy" fromMonty Python'sLife of Brian),[49]and favourite one-liner in a 2003 poll of 1,000 film fans.[50]Culminating in acliffhanger,The Italian Jobhas one of the most discussed end scenes in film; what happened to the coachload of gold teetering over the edge of a cliff has been debated in the decades since the film was released.[51][52]
After working onThe Italian JobwithNoël Coward, and a role asRAFfighter pilotsquadron leaderCanfield in the all-star cast ofBattle of Britain(both 1969), Caine played the lead inGet Carter(1971), a British gangster film. Caine also starred in a comedy thriller,Pulp(1972). Caine continued with successes includingSleuth(1972) oppositeLaurence Olivier, andJohn Huston'sThe Man Who Would Be King(1975) co-starringSean Connery, which received widespread acclaim.[53]The Timesapplauded the "lovely double act of Caine and Connery, clowning to their doom", while Huston paid tribute to Caine's improvisation as an actor: "Michael is one of the most intelligent men among the artists I've known. I don't particularly care to throw the ball to an actor and let him improvise, but with Michael it's different. I just let him get on with it."[53]In 1974, Caine appeared inThe Black Windmill, co-starringDonald Pleasence.
In 1976, Caine appeared inTom Mankiewicz's screen adaptation of theJack HigginsnovelThe Eagle Has LandedasOberst(Colonel) Kurt Steiner, the commander of aLuftwaffeparatroop unit disguised as Polishparatroopers, whose mission was to kidnap or kill the then-British Prime MinisterWinston Churchill, alongside co-starsDonald Sutherland,Robert Duvall,Jenny Agutterand Donald Pleasence. Caine also was part of an all-star cast inA Bridge Too Far(1977).[54]In 1978, Caine starred inSilver Bears, an adaptation ofPaul Erdman's 1974 novel of the same name, and co-starred in the Academy Award-winningCalifornia Suite. In the late 1970s, Caine's choice of roles was frequently criticised—something to which he has referred with self-deprecating comments about taking parts strictly for the money. He averaged two films a year, but these included such films asThe Swarm(1978) (although critically panned it was Academy Award-nominated for Best Costume Design),Ashanti(1979) andBeyond the Poseidon Adventure(1979).
In the early 1980s Caine appeared inThe Island(1980),The Hand(1981), and had a reunion with hisSleuthco-star Laurence Olivier inThe Jigsaw Man(1982).

In 1986, he portrayed the neurotic Elliot inWoody Allen's ensemble comedyHannah and Her Sisters, starringBarbara Hershey,Dianne Wiest, andMia Farrow. For his performance he won his firstAcademy AwardforBest Supporting Actor.[55]Peter BradshawofThe Guardianwrote in 2011, "Caine's performance, so fervent, so agonisingly dedicated, actually gains in force and touching sincerity with the years."[56]Caine also played a suave English conman, opposite a clumsy American played bySteve Martin, in the crime comedyDirty Rotten Scoundrels(1988), directed byFrank Oz. The film earned him aGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedynomination, losing toTom HanksinBig(1988).[57]
Caine's other successful films (critically or financially) were the 1980 Golden Globe-nominatedslasher filmDressed to Kill, the 1981war filmEscape to VictoryfeaturingSylvester Stalloneand footballers from the 1960s and 1970s, includingPeléandBobby Moore, the 1982 filmDeathtrap, andMona Lisa(1986). In 1987, Caine narratedHero, theofficial filmof the1986 FIFA World Cup.[58]That year he starred in the thriller and spy filmThe Fourth ProtocolalongsidePierce Brosnan. In 1988 he played Chief Insp.Frederick Abberlinein the two-part TV dramaJack the Ripper, which co-starredJane Seymourand was produced to coincide with the 100th anniversary of theJack the Rippermurder spree in Victorian London.[59]Despite his success in the 1980s, Caine also appeared in some poorly received films such asBlame It on Rio(1984), theDick ClementandIan La FrenaiscomedyWater(1985), the fourth and final film in theJawsfranchise,Jaws: The Revenge(1987), andWithout a Clue(1988) (portrayingSherlock Holmes). Caine's commitment to filmingJaws: The Revengein theBahamasmeant that he was unable to receive his Academy Award forHannah and Her Sistersin person and Dianne Wiest accepted it on his behalf. Caine said ofJaws: The Revenge, "I have never seen the film, but by all accounts it was terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific."[60][61]
"It was absolutely perfect at that time for what I wanted. I could make it, and my daughter could see it. That's why I did it. And it was lovely."
In the 1990s, Caine found good parts harder to come by. He played the mysterious bartender Mike inMr. Destinyin 1990 and appeared withRoger MooreinBullseye!(1990).He playedEbenezer ScroogeinThe Muppet Christmas Carol(1992).[63][64]Having been chosen byBrian Henson, Caine stated: "I'm going to play this movie like I'm working with theRoyal Shakespeare Company. I will never wink, I will never do anything Muppety. I am going to play Scrooge as if it is an utterly dramatic role and there are no puppets around me."[65]He played the beleaguered stage director Lloyd Fellowes in the film adaptation ofNoises Off(1992). He also played a villain in theSteven SeagalfilmOn Deadly Ground(1994). He was starred twostraight to videoHarry Palmer sequels and a few television films.
Caine's performance inLittle Voice(1998) won him aGolden Globe Award. Better parts followed, includingThe Cider House Rules(1999), for which he won his secondAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[66]In the 2000s, Caine appeared in the comedyMiss Congeniality(2000) as the refined pageant coach oppositeSandra Bullockas the undercoverFBIagent. The film was a massive box office success and Caine earned praise for his comic turn. That same year Caine also appeared inPhilip Kaufman's controversial yet acclaimed filmQuills(2000) asDr. Royer-CollardoppositeGeoffrey Rush,Kate Winslet, andJoaquin Phoenix. In 2001, Caine starred in the ensemble dramedyLast OrdersstarringHelen Mirren,Bob Hoskins, andTom Courtenay. Caine's next filmThe Quiet American(2002) won him great critical acclaim withRoger Ebertwriting, "[it's] a performance that seems to descend perfectly formed. There is no artifice in it, no unneeded energy, no tricks, no effort".[67]Caine earned his sixthAcademy Awardnomination as well as aGolden Globe AwardandBritish Academy Film Awardfor his performance.
Several of Caine's classic films have been remade, includingThe Italian Job,Get Carter,AlfieandSleuth. Caine appeared inGet Carterthe 2000 American action thriller film directed by Stephen Kay; a remake of his 1971 filmGet Carter, in which a younger Michael Caine played the title role. Here in the 2000 remake, Caine's role was originally relegated to a one-scene cameo appearance, which he agreed to do as a favor to his friend Sylvester Stallone. However, after a test screening, additional scenes were scripted and shot to expand his role. The film was released in the U.S. on 6 October 2000. Critical reaction was negative, and the film flopped at the box office, with worldwide earnings of approximately only $19 million against a production budget of nearly $64 million. Stallone said: "Believe it or not, I think Get Carter was really underrated. That was a big disappointment. I learned the hard way that [remakes], even if you do it better than the original, there’s a tremendous nostalgia attached to the original. And quite often they’re not done as well."

Caine is one of the few actors to have played a starring role in two versions of the same film. In an interview with CNN, Law spoke of his admiration for Caine: "I learned so much just from watching how he monitored his performance, and also how little he has to do. He's a master technician and sometimes he was doing stuff I didn't see, I couldn't register. I'd go back and watch it on the monitor, it was like 'Oh my God, the amount of variety he's put in there is breathtaking".[68]

The film premiered at theSundance Film Festivalto mixed reviews, with critics praising its performances and lavish production design.[84][85]In the 2021 filmTwist, an adaptation ofCharles Dickens'Oliver Twistset in the present day, Caine playsFagin.[86]In interviews promoting the 2021 filmBest Sellers, Caine suggested that he would not make another film, citing difficulty in walking and his new interest in novel-writing developed during theCOVID-19 lockdowns.[87]However, his representatives toldVarietythat he was not retiring from acting.[88]In 2022, Caine filmedThe Great Escaper, a British-French feature film starring Caine andGlenda Jackson, based on the true-life story of a BritishWorld War IIveteran who 'broke out' of his nursing home to attend the 70th anniversaryD-Daycommemorations in France, in June 2014.[89]The film was released on 6 October 2023.[89]
Caine officially confirmed his retirement from acting on 13 October 2023, mainly because of the decreasing likelihood of him getting any more leading roles.[90]Caine announced his retirement from acting in a BBCTodayradio programme interview withMartha Kearney. Referring toThe Great Escaperhe said, "I keep saying I'm going to retire, well I am now, because I figured, I've had a picture which is — I played the lead and it's got incredible reviews. The only parts I'm liable to get now are old men, 90-year-old men, and I thought well I might as well leave with all this. I've got wonderful reviews. What am I going to do to beat this?"[91]
"I kept my cockney accent in order to let other working class boys know that if I made it, they could do it too."
Caine is regarded as a British cultural icon, with Mairi Mackay of CNN stating: "Michael Caine has been personifying British cool since theswinging sixties. He has brought some of British cinema's most iconic characters to life and introduced his very own laid-backcockneygangster into pop culture. He doggedly retained a regional accent at a time when the plummy tones ofReceived Pronunciationwere considered obligatory. It is a sweet irony that his accent has become his calling card."[68]In 2015The Timescalled Caine "the epitome of Sixties cool in his first outing as the secret agent Harry Palmer".[7]A trailer for his second role as Palmer described him as possessing "horn rims, cockney wit and an iron fist".[92]
With his distinctive voice and manner of speaking, Caine is a popular subject for impersonators and mimics.[93]Most Caine impressions include the catchphrase "Not a lot of people know that."[68]The catchphrase emanates from Caine's habit of informing people of obscure "interesting facts" that he has collected.[94]Referring to Caine as being the "biggest mine ofuseless information",Peter Sellersinitiated thecatchphrasewhen he appeared on BBC1'sParkinsonshow on 28 October 1972 and said:
Not many people know that. This is my Michael Caine impression. You see, Mike's always quoting from theGuinness Book of Records. At the drop of a hat he'll trot one out. 'Did you know that it takes a man in a tweed suit five-and-a-half seconds to fall from the top ofBig Bento the ground?' Now there's not many people who know that![95]
Caine later spoke of how Sellers used his impression of him as hisanswering machinemessage in the 1970s: "I called Peter one day, he wasn't in. And there was me saying, 'My name is Michael Caine. I just want you to know that Peter Sellers is not in. Not many people know that.' He invented that 'not many people know that.' And then everybody who rang him, they got me saying, 'Not many people know that.'"[96]Over the years Caine himself had parodied his catchphrase and his "interesting facts", and has imitated others' impressions of him.[97]In an interview withMichael Parkinsonin 2007, Caine commented on the impersonations of his voice, "I can do it. 'Hello. My name is Michael Caine. Not many people know that.' I sound like a bloody moron. You know where they've got me now? On birthday cards. 'It's your birthday today. Not many people know that'. Now they've got me on Satellite navigation. It's me going, 'take the second turn on the right, and you'll wind up right in the shit.'"[97]In 1983, Caine used his "not a lot of people know that" phrase as a joke in the filmEducating Rita.[68]
The comedy sketch showHarry Enfield's Television Programmeincluded a series of sketches in whichPaul Whitehouseplayed a character called Michael Paine; an amalgam of previous Michael Caine impressions, who in a reference to Caine's characterHarry PalmerfromThe Ipcress Filewears oversized, thick-rimmed glasses and a trench coat. He introduces himself with the line, "My name is Michael Paine, and I am a nosy neighbour" and in a spoof of the stakeout at the beginning ofThe Ipcress File, recounts to the camera the 'suspiciously' mundane behaviour of his neighbours, before saying, "Not a lot of people know that I know that".[98]Caine's Harry Palmer character (with the glasses, the girls, and disregard for authority) was among the many British pop cultural influences forMike Myers'Austin Powersfilms.[99]At Myers' request, Caine himself starred inAustin Powers in Goldmember(2002), with his portrayal of Nigel Powers, father of Austin Powers, spoofing Harry Palmer.[99]
A parody of Caine appears in the animated seriesUgly Americans, in the episode "The Dork Knight", which also parodies the filmThe Dark Knight. In the episode, Caine appears as himself, portrayed in the light of his Alfred Pennyworth interpretation, and constantly annoys the protagonists with endless anecdotes of his career.
The 2010 television seriesThe Trip, starringRob BrydonandSteve Coogan, featured improvised scenes in which the two leads argue over who can do the better Michael Caine impression.[100]Among the lines they repeat in their attempts to outdo each other are, "You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!" and, "She was only sixteen years old"—fromThe Italian JobandGet Carter, respectively.[100]Coogan and Brydon later did their impressions from a balcony at the Royal Albert Hall during a celebration of Caine's work, only to be interrupted by the real Caine informing them that they were out of shape: "For me, it's a full-time job."[101]
Craig Fergusonran segments on his show where he parodied Caine, usually while wearing aspace suit.[102]In a 2010 interview withThe Telegraph, Caine spoke of the impersonations and how everyone he meets quotes lines at him, to the point he quotes them quoting him.[98]When asked whether he is ever tired of telling his anecdotes, Caine stated: "I enjoy making people laugh. The trick is to tell them against yourself. If you praise yourself your stories aren't funny."[98]
In 2018, Caine starred in aBritish Airwayspre-flight safety video, appearing with six other British celebrities, including actressesOlivia ColmanandNaomie Harris. Promoting the Flying Start children's charity partnership between BA andComic Relief, they are featured 'auditioning' in humorous sketches while also highlighting important safety messages.[103]

They met after Caine saw her in aMaxwell Housecoffee commercial and a friend gave him her telephone number. He called her every day for ten days until she finally agreed to meet him.[116]They have a daughter, Natasha Haleema.[109][117]Baksh is aMuslimwhile Caine is a Christian. He reflected in 2009, "My wife is a Muslim and she does Muslim stuff; I'm a Christian and I do Christian stuff, and no questions ever come up. The media view of Muslims is different from mine, which is very benign and peaceful".[118]
Proud of his working-class roots, Caine has discussed the opportunities his film career gave him: "I got to play football withPelé, for God's sake. And I danced withBob Fosse."[98]He also became close friends withJohn Lennon, stating: "With John and I it was a case of bonding because we were both working class and we shared a sense of humour. We were pretending we weren't who people thought we were."[98]His closest friends included twoJames Bondactors,Sean ConneryandRoger Moore.[98]
Some time after his mother died, Caine and his younger brother,Stanley, learned they had an elder half-brother named David. He suffered from severeepilepsyand had been kept inCane Hill Mental Hospitalhis entire life. Although their mother regularly visited her first son in the hospital, even her husband did not know the child existed. David died in 1992.[119]
In July 2016, Cainechanged his namebydeed pollto his long-time stage name to simplify security checks at airports. Caine stated that because the security guard often recognised him but was unaware of his real name, it would waste a considerable amount of his time as he tried to prove that he and "Maurice Joseph Micklewhite" were the same person:
"[A security guard] would say, 'Hi Michael Caine,' and suddenly I'd be giving him a passport with a different name on it. I could stand there for an hour. So I changed my name."[120]
Caine is a fan ofchill-out music, and he released a compilation CD calledCainedin 2007 on theUMTVrecord label.[121][122]He met his good friendElton Johnand was discussing musical tastes, when Caine said that he had been creating chilloutmix tapesas an amateur for years.[122][123]Caine and Elton John had also appeared on the same episode ofParkinson, where they sang an impromptu version of thepubtune "Knees Up Mother Brown".[124]Also in music, Caine provided vocal samples for the ska-pop bandMadnessfor their 1984 hit "Michael Caine", as his daughter was a fan. He has sung in film roles as well, includingLittle Voiceand for the 1992 musical filmThe Muppet Christmas Carol.[125]
Caine quit his 80-a-day smoking habit in the early 1970s after a lecture fromTony Curtis.[126]He is a supporter of the football club,Chelsea FC.[127]Caine is also a fan ofcricket. This was alluded to byGary Oldman, who acted with Caine inThe Dark Knight Rises, when he talked about Caine's acting methods: "It's, 'Take one'. He got it. 'Take two', got it. 'Take three', got it. He's just on the money. ... He doesn't fuck around because he wants to get back to cricket."[128]
Trivia books written by Caine includeNot Many People Know That!,And Not Many People Know This Either!,Michael Caine's Moving Picture Show, andNot a Lot of People Know This Is 1988. Proceeds from the books went to theNational Playing Fields Association, a UK charity for which Caine served as vice president, and which aims to protect and promote open spaces for sports and recreation in British cities and towns.[129]Starting in 1976 Caine became part owner ofLangan's Brasserieand at one point had ownership in seven restaurants in the UK and United States.[130]
Caine has often been outspoken about his political views, referring to himself as a "left-wing Tory" influenced by both hisworking classbackground andKorean Warservice.[131][132]He left the United Kingdom for the United States in the late 1970s, citing theincome taxlevied on top earners by theLabourgovernment ofJames Callaghan, which then stood at 83%.[133]He lived inBeverly Hillsduring that time, but returned to the UK eight years later when taxes had been lowered by theConservativegovernment ofMargaret Thatcher:
I realised that's not asocialistcountry, it's acommunistcountry without a dictator, so I left and I was never going to come back. Maggie Thatcher came in and put the taxes back down and in the end, you know, you don't mind paying tax. What am I going to do? Not pay tax and drive around in aRolls-Royce, withcripplesbegging on the street like you see in some countries?[134]
Following the launch of his filmHarry Brownin 2009, Caine called for the reintroduction ofnational servicein the UK to give young people "a sense of belonging, rather than a sense of violence".[135]
In 2009, Caine publicly criticised theLabour governmentofGordon Brownfor its new 50% income tax rate on top earners and threatened to return to the United States if his taxes were increased further.[132]During the run up to the2010 general election, Caine publicly endorsed theConservative Partyand appeared with then-party leaderDavid Cameronfor the launch of a civilian non-compulsory "National Service" for sixteen-year-olds, although Caine stated he had previously supportedNew Labourunder the leadership ofTony Blairin1997.[136]In July 2014, Caine was reported to have been a celebrity investor in atax avoidancescheme called Liberty.[137]In November 2014, Caine described the proposedmansion taxby then Labour leaderEd Milibandas "preposterous and silly".[138]
Caine voted in favour ofBrexitin the2016 European Referendum, stating he would rather be a "poor master than a rich servant".[139]He said he was a reluctant Leaver; "I don't know what to vote for. Both are scary. To me, you've now got in Europe a sort of government-by-proxy of everybody, who has now got carried away. Unless there is some extremely significant changes, we should get out."[140]
In November 2024, following the election of Labour Party leaderSir Keir Starmeras Prime Minister in theJuly of that year, Caine supported the petition on theUK Parliament petitions websitethat demands anew general electionin the UK by sharing it on hisXaccount.[141]

The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
