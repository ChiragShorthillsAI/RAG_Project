Studios, Leavesdenin England, as well as theDistrict of Columbiaand Northern Virginia in the U.S., London and Duxford in England, Tenerife and Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands and Almería.

Following multiple delays due to theCOVID-19 pandemic,Wonder Woman 1984eventually premiered on December 15, 2020, via theDC FanDomevirtual platform, and was released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on December 25, 2020. Most in-person theaters were shut down due to the COVID-19 shelter-in-place/quarantine orders. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $169 million worldwide against a production budget of $200 million. It failed to break even in part due to a simultaneous release onHBO Max, where it became the top streaming film of 2020. A spin-off prequel series focusing on theAmazonsofThemyscira,Paradise Lost, set in the soft-rebootedDC Universeis in development.
As a child,Dianaparticipates in an athletic competition onThemysciraagainst adultAmazons. After being knocked off her horse, she takes a shortcut and remounts, but misses a checkpoint.Antioperemoves her from the race for cheating, explaining that anything worthwhile must be obtained honestly, while her motherHippolytaadvises her to be patient in her pursuit of glory and honor.
In 1984, Diana is working at theSmithsonian Institutionin Washington, D.C., while secretly performing heroic deeds as Wonder Woman. New museum employeeBarbara Minerva, a shy geologist and cryptozoologist, has trouble getting noticed by her co-workers, but quickly finds a friend in Diana.
TheFBIasks the museum to identify stolen antiquities from a robbery that Wonder Woman recently foiled; Barbara and Diana notice a Latin inscription on one artifact (the Dreamstone) claiming to grant the holder one wish. Neither one openly takes the inscription seriously, but after Diana saves Barbara from an assailant by secretly using her powers, Barbara wishes she was strong, sexy, and cool "like" Diana and thus unintentionally acquires the same superpowers. Because Diana yearns forSteve Trevor, her lover who died heroically, he is resurrected in another man's body and they are reunited.
Failing businessmanMaxwell "Max Lord" Lorenzanosteals the Dreamstone, hoping to use its power to save his nearly bankrupt oil company. His wish is to "become" the stone and gain its powers: whenever he grants someone else's desire, he can take what he wants from the wisher. This soon results in worldwide chaos, destruction, and instability.
Diana discovers that the Dreamstone was created byDolos/Mendacius, The God of Lies, also known as theDuke of Deception. It grants a user's wish but exacts an equally strong toll unless they renounce the wish or destroy the stone. Although Diana's powers and Barbara's humanity begin to diminish, neither is willing to renounce her wish.
Max visits theU.S. President, who wishes for more nuclear missiles as protection against theSoviets, but these are detected, bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war. Max also learns of a new and secret satellite system that can broadcast to everyone in the world simultaneously. Since his powers are causing his body to deteriorate, he plans to grant wishes globally to steal strength and life force from the viewers and regain his health. Diana and Steve confront him, but Barbara sides with Max, overpowering Diana and escaping with him onMarine One.
Steve convinces Diana to renounce her wish and let him go, restoring her to full strength. Donning the armor of Asteria, the greatest of all Amazon warriors, Diana flies to the satellite headquarters and again battles Barbara, who has transformed into a humanoid cheetah after wishing to become an apex predator. After a brutal fight that ends in a lake, Diana overcomes Barbara with an electric shock, then pulls her out of the water.
Diana confronts Max and uses herLasso of Truthto communicate with the world through him, persuading everyone to renounce their wish. She then shows him visions of his unhappy childhood and of his son, Alistair, who is frantically searching for his father amid the chaos. Realizing the error of his ways, Max renounces his wish and reunites with Alistair, simultaneously renouncing everyone else's wishes, and turning Barbara back to normal. In the present day, it is winter, and Diana meets the man whose body Steve possessed.
In amid-credits scene,Asteriais revealed to be alive, living among humans and also secretly heroic.

Wonder Woman 1984was theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures in a handful of international markets starting on December 16, 2020,[115]and was theatrically released in the United States and Canada on December 25 inRealD 3D,Dolby CinemaandIMAXwhile streaming onHBO Maxin the United States and via premium video-on-demand in Canada the same day.[116][117][118]IMAX theaters showed a version of the film with a taller aspect ratio during select scenes.[119]That version was also seen on HBO Max as well. The film was released theatrically in additional markets through January 28, 2021.[115]
It was originally announced for release on December 13, 2019,[120]before being moved up to November 1, 2019,[121]then it was delayed to June 5, 2020.[122]On March 24, 2020, withtheatres closed for an uncertain period of time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was delayed to August 14, 2020, taking the release date ofMalignant.[123]In June 2020, another delay saw the film's release pushed to October 2, 2020,[124][118]before it was delayed further to the Christmas date in September, following the tepid opening weekend of Warner Bros'Tenetin the United States and in response to the continued closure of theaters in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City at the time.[117]
Later,Varietyreported the film would be keeping its Christmas release date in theaters, while the film would also premiere digitally on HBO Max in the United States the same day, with the film being available at no extra cost to subscribers, after a staggered theatrical release schedule in most international markets that do not have HBO Max starting on December 16,[125]including Greece, South Africa and the United Kingdom.[115]Shortly after,Deadline Hollywoodreported that in order to get exhibitors on board with the day-and-date HBO Max release, Warner Bros. agreed to take a lower cut of the rental revenue than it usually does with a tentpole release, as well as to pull the film from HBO Max after a month so that the second month of the film's run would be exclusive to theaters.[126]The site also said industry analysts had estimated the film's break-even point at $500million and that it was expected to lose money for the studio.[127]Adam Aron, CEO of US theater chainAMC Theatres, supported the simultaneous release strategy, stating, "Given that atypical circumstances call for atypical economic relationships between studios and theaters and atypical windows and releasing strategies, AMC is fully onboard for Warner Brothers' announcement."[128]
The film's simultaneous release strategy led to Warner Bros. announcing on December 3, 2020, that its entire slate of 2021 films would be given the same release strategy.[129]This led to many filmmakers, production companies and theater chains (who were not informed and consulted with over the move) to voice their disappointment and displeasure over the move, especially in regards to the special treatment given to the cast and filmmakers ofWonder Woman 1984that was not given to the other filmmakers and actors with their 2021 films.[130]Despite being paid her bonus by Warner Bros. as a result of the move, Patty Jenkins herself expressed both worry and optimism over the move's impact on the future of theaters and moviegoing.[131]
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the film was released on premium video-on-demand services as a 48-hour rental for January 13, 2021 due to the lockdown and closure of theaters in response to COVID-19 surges.[132]While in the Philippines, it was released onHBO Goon April 21, 2021, for the same reason.[133]
The film was re-added to HBO Max following its premiere on HBO's linear channel on May 13, 2021.[134]

Following its opening weekend, Warner Bros. announced that HBO Max saw total viewing hours on the film's first day more than triple in comparison to a typical day in the previous month.[137]Several days later, Screen Engine reported that 23% of viewers had subscribed to HBO Max in order to watch the film. The company also said thatWonder Woman 1984was already the most-watched straight-to-streaming title of the year, beatingHamilton.[138]According toNielsen, the film totaled 2.25 billion minutes spent by HBO Max users over its first three days of release, "equivalent to about 14.9 million complete plays of the 151-minute movie".[139][140]
Samba TV later reported that the film was watched in 3.2 million households within its first week of release[141]and 3.9 million in the first 17 days and in over 4.3 million U.S. households by the end of its month.[142][143]Following its third weekend of release,Deadline Hollywoodwrote "if there's anything positive to report, we'll hear about on the next AT&T earnings call" but if viewership numbers were noteworthy "we would have already heard about it."[144]In January 2022, tech firm Akami reported thatWonder Woman 1984was the eighth most pirated film of 2021.[145]
Wonder Woman 1984grossed $46.8 million in the United States and Canada and $122.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $169.6 million.[5]In January 2021,The Hollywood Reporterwrote that the film would likely lose the studio "north of $100 million."[146]
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongsideNews of the World,Promising Young WomanandPinocchioand was projected to gross around $10 million from 2,151 theaters in its opening weekend.[147]It ended up debuting to $16.7 million, finishing above expectations and with the best total of the COVID-19 pandemic, but 87% less than the first film's opening weekend.[148][137]Over 10,000 private screenings of the film were held, accounting for about $2 million (12%) of the opening weekend total.[149]It fell 68% in its second weekend, grossing $5.4 million.[150]In its third weekend the film fell another 46% to $3 million, withDeadline Hollywoodsaying it "continued to emulate the legs of a horror movie".[144]The film grossed $2.2 million in its fourth weekend, finishing second behind newcomerThe Marksman.[151]
Internationally, the film was expected to debut to around $60 million from 32 countries.[152][153]Global projections were subsequently lowered to $35–40 million and the film went on to debut to $38.2 million, including $5 million from IMAX screens.

Its largest markets were Australia ($4.5 million) and Japan ($2.5 million), while China's running total reached $23.9 million.[155]
SlatecalledWonder Woman 1984's critical response "lukewarm",[156]andNewsweekdescribed it as "mixed".[157]The Washington Postreported that the response changed from "early praise to precipitous decline".[158]According toVariety, critics praised the film's "escapist qualities" and Jenkins' take on the 1980s, but many commentators found it "overindulgent or clichéd".[159]
OnRotten Tomatoes, 58% of 455 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Wonder Woman 1984struggles with sequel overload, but still offers enough vibrant escapism to satisfy fans of the franchise and its classic central character."[160]Upon the initial drop of thereview embargo, the film achieved a 90% positive review score; this score gradually dropped until it ended up at 59% after the release.[161][162]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 60 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[163]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale (lower than the "A" received by its predecessor), and PostTrak reported 78% of those gave the film a positive score, with 67% saying they would definitely recommend it.[148]
Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a "B" and wrote "Wonder Woman 1984is all about playing with magic and wishes and desires, only to see them lead to horrible ramifications, instant gratification and the revelation that lying is never without consequence. Those are some big swings and not every single one lands, but the ones that do are both joyous and genuinely worth pondering."[164]Jake Coyle ofThe Associated Pressconsidered the film "both campier and more real than Marvel movies — more like the page-turning thrill of a comic book", writing that the film has "ambitions...just outside its grasp, but it seldom feels predestined or predictable — a preciously rare commodity in the genre."[165]Nicholas Barber of BBC gave the film four stars out of five, likening it favorably to a 1980s blockbuster and considering the plot to have a "sweet fairy-tale aspect."[166]Richard Roeper of theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying, "To be sure, we get a classic comic book movie storyline about a megalomaniacal madman intent on taking over the world, but there's often a relatively light tone to the proceedings. This is a throwback piece of pure pop entertainment."[167]
Alonso Duralde ofTheWrapwrote: "Even if the notion of wishes — making them and then takesies-backsies — isn't quite a cinematic enough concept to support Wonder Woman's final face-off with Lord,Wonder Woman 1984still brings a freshness and a wit that's often lacking in these gargantuan costumed-hero sagas."[168]Writing forThe Guardian,Peter Bradshawgave the film 3 out of 5 stars and stated, "Gadot is terrifically imposing, while Kristen Wiig is the scene-stealing antagonist in Patty Jenkins' epically brash sequel."[169]
Manohla Dargis ofThe New York Timeswrote that "Patty Jenkins is behind the camera again, but this time without the confidence. Certainly some of the problems can be pinned on the uninterestingly janky script, a mess of goofy jokes, storytelling clichés and dubious politics."[170]Adam Graham ofThe Detroit Newsgave the film a "C" and wrote that "the result is far from wondrous, a reminder of the limitations of the superhero genre and the ways its escapist trappings sacrifice key storytelling elements (narrative, characters, dialogue) for empty spectacle."[171]Mick LaSalle of theSan Francisco Chroniclepraised Gadot, writing "Her performance here has dignity and earned emotion" and calling her the best thing about the film, adding, "She was the best thing in the first installment, too, but that was an excellent movie. This one isn't." He concluded, "Often, it's a beautiful-looking film — but it's beauty without substance."[27]In her review for RogerEbert.com, Christy Lemire wrote "The quality that made the original film such a delight has been squashed almost entirely."[172]
A plot point in which Steve inhabits the body of another man, credited as "Handsome Man", was criticized as Steve puts this body into dangerous situations and uses it without consent, including a scene in which it is implied that sex may have occurred between Diana and Steve. Criticism was aimed at the film's lack of acknowledgment of what happened to the man while Steve was inhabiting his body, as well as Diana and Steve not appearing to consider the issue of consent, even if Steve coming back but in another man's body was not any of the characters' intention.[173]
The Mary Suedescribed the event as a rape and strongly condemned it.[174]Jenkins replied in agreement to a fan's tweet that tries to explain there were no issues with this plot aspect, that the film was following the trope of a body swap, similar toBigorFreaky Friday. Bonnie Burton, writing forCNET, stated that while this may have been Jenkins' intention, the body swap trope may not be as politically correct in the current period as it was in the 1980s.[175]
In January 2019, after principal photography onWonder Woman 1984was completed, director and co-writerPatty Jenkinsannounced that she had mapped out the plot for a thirdWonder Womanfilm set in the present day.[189][190]In December 2019, she said the third movie would take longer to produce than the second.[191]In April 2020, Jenkins said she had a story arc for four Wonder Woman films, including an Amazons film and then a third Wonder Woman film.[192]In June 2020, Jenkins said that she had stopped working on the story so she could see how to absorb the result of the COVID-19 pandemic into the story.[193]In December 2020, Jenkins said that she andGeoff Johnshad "beat out an entire story" for a third film, but she had doubts about whether to make it with the world's current state, whether it will be her next film, and whether her feelings about it will change.[194]Gal Gadot expressed that she wanted the third film to take place in the present, saying "the past has been handled well and now it's time to move on".[195]
The sequel was officially greenlit on December 27, 2020, with Jenkins and Gadot officially returning and Warner Bros. confirming that the film would have a traditional theatrical release as compared toWonder Woman 1984.[196]In December 2022,The Hollywood Reporterreported that a thirdWonder Womanfilm from Jenkins was not moving forward because it "did not fit in" with the plans for the DCEU put forth by newDC StudiosheadsJames GunnandPeter Safran.[197]The film and other DC Studios projects in development were put into doubt as a result of the change in leadership, which Gunn claimed resulted in a transition period that created "drawbacks" and resulted in production on new films being delayed.[198]Jenkins later stated that the film would not proceed under the new plans for DCEU being developed by Gunn and Safran.[199]On January 31, 2023, Gunn and Safran stated that they had offered to let Gadot continue playing the character of Wonder Woman in the newDC Universefilms.[200]In June 2023, Gadot stated that "things were being worked behind the scenes" in regards to her continuing to play Wonder Woman,[201]and in August 2023 claimed that she would be developing a thirdWonder Womanfilm with Gunn and Safran;[202]however, later media reports claimed that this was not the case.[203][204]Any chances of a third film were effectively quelled in October 2023, whenVarietyreported that none of the DCEU actors cast forZack Snyder's films would reprise their roles in the DCU, including Gadot as Wonder Woman.[205]
In December 2019, during a press tour ahead of Sunday'sWonder Woman 1984panelatComic Con Experiencein São Paulo, director Patty Jenkins noted she was considering a spin-off focusing on the Amazons.[206]Jenkins is attached as executive producer.[207]By April 2020, Jenkins revealed that she will not direct the spin-off, though she will serve as executive producer.[192]Later that year, the filmmaker stated that the spin-off will take place after Diana leaves Themyscira and that it will be linked to the events betweenWonder Woman 1984and the thirdWonder Womanfilm.[208]
In January 2023,DC StudiosannouncedParadise Lost, a television series forMaxcentered on the Amazons, and stated that it was in the same vein asGame of Thrones,set on the all-female island of Themyscira, where Wonder Woman was born. The show focuses on political power struggles and secrets. It is set before the events of the Wonder Woman movies.[209]Later in November, 2024, it was revealed that it would be part of the DCU's Chapter 1 – "Gods and Monsters" slate. It remains unclear whether this project is a reimagining of the previously announced Wonder Woman spinoff or an entirely new concept. According toCBRthe series is expected to lay the foundation for the DCU's version of the heroine, potentially serving as a platform to introduce a new Wonder Woman.[210]

Warner Bros. Picturesis an Americanfilm studioanddistributionarm of theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Groupdivision ofWarner Bros., which are both ultimately owned byWarner Bros. Discovery. It is headquartered at theWarner Bros. Studios complexinBurbank, California. Animated films produced byWarner Bros. Pictures Animationare also released under the studio banner.[3]
Founded in 1923 by brothersHarry Warner,Albert Warner,Sam Warner, andJack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, includingWarner Bros. Pictures Animation,New Line CinemaandCastle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.
Warner Bros. Pictures is currently one of four live-action film studios within theWarner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake inSpyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film franchises from Warner Bros. includesHarry Potter,DC Universe(formerlyDC Extended Universe),Batman,The Lord of the Rings,andMonsterverse;Barbieis the studio'shighest-grossing film worldwidewith $1.4 billion.[4]
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as theWarner Features CompanyinNew Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmakerSam Warnerand his business partners and brothers,Harry,Albert, andJack, in 1910.[5]They produced their first film, thePeril of the Plains[6]in 1912, which Sam directed for theSt. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7]while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10]In 1918, duringWW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the bookMy Four Years in GermanybyJames W. Gerardto be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11]Thewar filmwas a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]
On April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13]In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when theAmerican-JewishWarner brothers released their first pictures "talkie"The Jazz SingerstarringAl Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14]When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.
The studio has released twenty-five films that have received anAcademy Award for Best Picturenomination:Disraeli(1929),I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932),42nd Street(1933),Here Comes the Navy(1934),A Midsummer Night's Dream(1935),Anthony Adverse(1936),The Life of Emile Zola(1937),The Adventures of Robin Hood(1938),Four Daughters(1938),Jezebel(1938),Dark Victory(1939), to name a few.
In the aftermath of the1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17]films and cartoons toAssociated Artists Productions(a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained theFleischer StudiosandFamous StudiosPopeyecartoons, originally fromParamount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold toUnited Artists(UA), which owned the company until 1981, whenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business toSeven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20]Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamedWarner Bros.-Seven Artson July 14, 1967.[21]
In 1982, during their independent years,Turner Broadcasting SystemacquiredBrut Productions, the film production arm ofFrance-based then-struggling personal-care companyFaberge Inc.[22]
In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt,Turnerkept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to theRKO Radio Pictureslibrary) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]
In 1989,Warner CommunicationsacquiredLorimar-TelepicturesCorporation and merged withTime Inc.to formTime Warner(now known asWarner Bros. Discovery).[24][25]Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library ofRankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library ofMonogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.
In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studioHanna-Barberaand theRuby-Spearslibrary fromGreat American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquiredCastle Rock Entertainmenton December 22, 1993[26][27]andNew Line Cinemaon January 28, 1994.[28][29]On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.
The division was incorporated asWarner Bros. Pictureson March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30]The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31]In 2017, longtime New Line executiveToby Emmerichjoined as president.[32]In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34]On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35]In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement withSF Studiosto have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]
As with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020COVID-19 pandemicdue to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on theHBO Maxstreaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasingWonder Woman 1984that month.
After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37]The move to include streaming, dubbed "Project Popcorn", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38]leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]
In March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they would discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40]This is part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas).[41]
On June 1, 2022,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the company formerly known asDiscovery, Inc.prior to its acquisition ofWarnerMediatwo months earlier, announced that Emmerich would step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema,DC Films, andWarner Animation Group. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De Lucaand Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44]On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]
Steve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former presidentAlan Hornwas appointed as a consultant for WBD PresidentDavid Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]
In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47]That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]
Walter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49]President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51]On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]

DC Studiosis an American film and television production company that is a division ofWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD). It is responsible for the production of live-action and animated films and television series, as well as video games, based on characters from theAmerican comic bookpublisherDC Comics, primarily as part of its flagshipmedia franchiseandshared universe, theDC Universe(DCU). The studio has been led by writer/directorJames Gunnand producerPeter Safranas its co-chairmen and co-CEOs since it was formed in November 2022.
The studio's predecessor,DC Films, was formed in May 2016 as a division ofWarner Bros. Picturesto oversee DC-based film productions, primarily those from its shared universe franchise theDC Extended Universe(DCEU). It was led by DC comic book and television writerGeoff Johnsand Warner Bros. producer Jon Berg as co-chairmen. After several DCEU films received poor reception and underperformed financially, the duo stepped down by the end of 2017, and the division was reorganized, withWalter Hamadahired as the studio's president. Following the merger of DC and Warner Bros. ownerWarnerMediawithDiscovery, Inc.in April 2022, WBD overhauled operations, resulting in Hamada stepping down in October 2022. DC Films was then dissolved in favor of DC Studios, a new division with greater oversight of DC media. Gunn and Safran, who had worked on some DCEU projects, were hired to lead the studio, and the duo began work on the DCU as a new franchise to serve as asoft rebootof the DCEU.
From 2016 to 2023, DC Films produced 13 films within the DCEU, fromSuicide Squad(2016) toAquaman and the Lost Kingdom(2023), alongside two standalone films,Joker(2019) andThe Batman(2022).Jokerand the studio's filmAquaman(2018) are among the50 highest-grossing filmsof all time, withJokerbecoming the firstR-rated filmto gross over $1 billion. The first DC Studios production is the television seriesThe Penguin(2024), a spin-off fromThe Batman. DC Studios plans to release films and television series within the DCU, starting with the animated seriesCreature Commandosin 2024, and the filmSupermanin 2025. Productions that are not part of the DCU are set to be part of the "DC Elseworlds" label. The studio's first animated film will beDynamic Duo(2028).
After the divisive reception toBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016),Warner Bros. Picturessought to stabilize the direction of its media franchise andshared universe, theDC Extended Universe(DCEU). In May 2016, the studio reorganized to have genre-responsible film executives, thusDC Entertainmentfilms under Warner Bros. Pictures were placed under a new division, DC Films, to be led by Warner Bros.executive vice president, Jon Berg, and thechief creative officerofDC Comics,Geoff Johns. This was done in hopes of competing more directly withMarvel Studios' franchise, theMarvel Cinematic Universe. Johns kept his role at DC Comics, and reported to DC Entertainment's president,Diane Nelson, while Berg reported to Warner Bros. Pictures' president, Greg Silverman.[3]The division's formation was not designed to override the "director-driven" mandate.[8]
Justice League(2017) had one of the biggest film budgets (nearly $300 million) but grossed about $96 million in its opening weekend. An analysis inThe Washington Postexpected that there would be a course correction again, with a possible change in leadership.[9]Forbescontributors felt that the course correction would be for DC Films to give up on the shared universe, while continuing with theWonder Womanfilms and occasionally other films, as Warner Bros. had other franchises they could work with.[10]Despite this, in December, the studio reiterated their planned film slate for the DCEU.[11]That same month, Warner Bros. announced that a new strategy and organization of DC Films would occur, with Berg leaving his position as the studio's co-president of production to form a Warner Bros.–based production company withRoy Lee.[12][13]Johns was expected to remain involved in future DC films moving forward in an advisory role while continuing as the president and chief creative officer of DC Entertainment, with Warner Bros. expected to hire a new studio head.[12]In January 2018, Warner Bros. executiveWalter Hamadawas appointed as the new president of DC Films, to oversee the films in the DCEU. Hamada was closely associated withNew Line Cinema, and helped develop horror films, such asIt(2017) andThe Conjuringfilm franchise.[14]Johns subsequently left his role at DC Entertainment that June and he was no longer involved with the DCEU.[7]
In April 2022, after the merger between Warner Bros.' parent companyWarnerMediaandDiscovery, Inc.to formWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD), the new CEODavid Zaslavwas exploring a restructuring of DC Entertainment, including having a creative leader akin to Marvel Studios presidentKevin Feigeto lead its film and television projects.[15]Later in July,Toby Emmerichstepped down as the head of the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group. The group was restructured to give DC Films, Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, andWarner Animation Grouprespective leadership. FormerMGMexecutivesMichael De LucaandPamela Abdybecame the co-executives of Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. They were also temporarily signed to oversee the remaining units of the group until the new positions were filled.[16][17]
When the release of the filmBatgirlwas canceled by WBD in August, Hamada was not consulted regarding the decision and only learned about it when De Luca and Abdy informed him at a test screening forBlack Adam(2022). Hamada was upset and considered resigning, but agreed to stay untilBlack Adam'srelease.[18]Later that month,Dan Linentered talks to oversee DC's film and television divisions. From this position, Lin was expected to report directly to Zaslav, while Hamada would depart the studio.[19][20]In September, Lin and WBD ended negotiations and agreed to part ways.[21]DuringBlack Adam'sTimes Square premiere in October, star and producerDwayne Johnsonsaid he could be a consultant at DC Films, helping the studio find its next creative leader.[22]Later that month, it was reported that De Luca had been effectively running DC Films in place of Hamada.[23]On October 19, Hamada departed the company, two days before the release ofBlack Adam.[24]
Less than a week after Hamada's departure, writer/directorJames Gunnand producerPeter Safran, who had previously worked together on the DCEU projectsThe Suicide Squad(2021) and its spin-off seriesPeacemaker(2022), were announced as the co-CEOs and co-chairmen of DC Studios, a newly-created production entity under WBD. DC Films was dissolved, and DC Studios helped oversee the remaining films from the studio that were pending release in 2023. The duo was tasked with leading the production of films, television, animation, and video games under the DC label, reporting directly to Zaslav, while also working alongside but independently of the heads of WBD's other divisions. Gunn oversees the creative development of DC projects, while Safran supervises the production side. Their roles officially began on November 1, 2022.[1][25][2][26]
In November, Gunn said that the studio would focus on multiple DCU live-action and animated projects, but also stated that they would acknowledge fan responses and complaints,[27]and confirmed all subsequent DC projects would be released under the DC Studios banner, including those that were filmed before the formation of the studio.[28]In December, Gunn announced that he was writing a new Superman film that would feature a younger actor in the role.Henry Cavillwas not set to return asSuperman, whileBen Affleck, who portrayedBruce Wayne / Batmanin the DCEU, was reported to be in talks to direct a new DC Studios project, before Affleck stated that he was not interested in directing a DC film.[29][30]Gunn later revealed that new DC films would have an equal focus on popular and obscure characters, drawing inspiration from the DC animated seriesJustice League Unlimited(2004–2006) andYoung Justice(2010–2022).[31][32]
On January 31, 2023, Gunn and Safran announced the first slate of DCU content, titled "Chapter One: Gods and Monsters". They also assembled awriters' roomthat includedDrew Goddard,Jeremy Slater,Christina Hodson, Christal Henry, andTom King.[31]Projects that are not a part of the shared universe will be branded as "DC Elseworlds".[33]The following month, Gunn confirmed development for animated films within both the DCU and DC Elseworlds.[34]Gunn said in March that they were working on potentially incorporating characters from DC'sVertigo Comicsimprint beyond theSwamp Thingfilm,[35]and said the following month that there were plans to incorporate characters from the DC-ownedMilestone Media, such asStatic.[36]In September, WBD announced that it would expand its production facility atWarner Bros. Studios Leavesden, England, which would serve as the primary production hub for DC Studios. Gunn and Safran were consulting on the expansion, with work starting in the second quarter of 2024 and was expected to be finished in 2027.[37]
In February 2024, Gunn and Safran worked with WBD corporate siblings to acquire theChristopher ReevedocumentarySuper/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story(2024).[38][39]This is the first film to be released under the DC Studios banner,[40]whileThe Penguin(2024) is the first DC Studios production and the first series to be released under that banner.[41]AtSan Diego Comic-Conin July 2024, Gunn unveiled the official logo for DC Studios as an updated version of the 1977 "DC Bullet" logo designed byMilton Glaser, alongside an animated introduction sequence featuring Superman,[42][43][44]in a recreation of the back cover ofSuperman#1(1939) designed byWarner Bros. Animation.[45]The updated logo was also being used for DC Comics and its affiliated units,[42][43][44]but was not used for some earlier projects that DC Studios had inherited, namelyThe Penguinand the animated seriesHarley Quinn(2019–present), because they were not as involved in those. A slightly different DC Studios logo animation is used for the end credits onThe Penguin, while a separate logo and opening animation are set to be used for future projects released under the "DC Elseworlds" banner.[45]
That October, DC Studios andWarner Bros. Pictures Animationgreenlit the theatrical animated filmDynamic Duo(2028), which is DC Studios's first animated film and the first new project to move forward at the studio following its DCU announcements.[46][47][48]The filmJoker: Folie à Deux(2024) is part of the "DC Elseworlds" label and was overseen by Warner Bros. Pictures co-chiefs De Luca and Abdy, without the involvement of Gunn, Safran, or DC Studios, although the DC logo used before that studio's formation is included in the credits. At the time of the film's release later that month, Gunn said that "[a]ll future films with DC characters [would] be DC Studios" productions moving forward,[49]and he later clarified that the studio would release every subsequent film and television adaptation from DC.[45][50]Ahead of the premiere of the DCU seriesCreature Commandosin December 2024, DC Studios announced the unscripted biweekly video podcast seriesDC Studios Showcase: The Official Podcast, produced byOBB Soundfor the streaming serviceMax.[51]Later that month, they also announced the launch of its DC Studios Fan First newsletter via DC's website, to provide updates on the company's projects, with an introduction message written by Gunn.[52]In February 2025, DC Studios announced that it had greenlit three "younger-skewed" animated series—Starfire!,My Adventures with Green Lantern, andDC Super Powers—which were being co-produced with Warner Bros. Animation.[53]
All of the live-action and animated films by DC Films and DC Studios are distributed byWarner Bros. Pictures.
In addition to the following films, DC Studios has also reserved release dates for unspecified films on May 29, 2026, and March 5, 2027.[60]

Max, also known asHBO Max,[b]is an Americansubscription video on-demandover-the-topstreamingservice. It is a proprietary unit ofWarner Bros. Discovery Global Streaming & Games, which is itself a division ofWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD).[2]The platform offers content from thelibrariesofWarner Bros.,Discovery,HBO,CNN,Cartoon Network,Adult Swim,Animal Planet,TBS,TNT,Eurosport, and their related brands. Max first launched (as HBO Max) in the United States on May 27, 2020.
The service also carries first-run original programming under the "Max Originals" banner, programming from the HBOpay televisionservice, and content acquired via either third-party library deals (such as those with film studios for pay television rights) or co-production agreements (including, among others, those withBBC StudiosandSesame Workshop).
When the service was first launched as HBO Max, it succeeded bothHBO Now, a previous HBO SVOD service; andHBO Go, theTV Everywherestreaming platform for HBO pay television subscribers. In the United States, HBO Now subscribers and HBO pay television subscribers were migrated to HBO Max at no additional charge, subject to availability and device support. HBO Max also supplanted the streaming component ofDC Entertainment'sDC Universeservice, with its original series being migrated to HBO Max as Max Originals. The HBO Max service began to expand into international markets in 2021.
According toAT&T,[c]HBO and HBO Max had a combined total of 69.4 million paying subscribers globally on June 30, 2021, including 43.5 million HBO Max subscribers in the U.S., 3.5 million HBO-only U.S. subscribers (primarily commercial customers like hotels), and 20.5 million subscribers to either HBO Max or HBO by itself in other countries.[3]By the end of 2021, HBO and HBO Max had a combined total of 73.8 million paying global subscribers.[4][5]At the end of Q1 2022, HBO and HBO Max had 76.8 million global subscribers.[6]
Since the April 2022 merger ofWarnerMediawithDiscovery, Inc.to form Warner Bros. Discovery, Max is one of the combined company's two flagship streaming services, the other beingDiscovery+(which primarily focuses onfactualandrealityprogramming from the Discovery brands). WBD initially announced plans for HBO Max and Discovery+ to merge in 2023, but the company ultimately chose to retain Discovery+. As part of the decision, WBD migrated some Discovery+ shows to Max whilst also leaving them on Discovery+. WBD went on to replace HBO Max with a newly rebranded service, shortening the service's name to "Max", which launched in the United States on May 23, 2023, in Latin America on February 27, 2024, and in Europe on May 21, 2024, introducing a redesigned user interface, and adding more Discovery content. The rebrand was also applied to Netherlands, Poland, France, and several other regions in 2024. In Belgium and the Netherlands the name "HBO Max" was retained with a new Max logo.
On October 10, 2018, WarnerMedia announced that it would launch anover-the-topstreaming servicein late 2019, featuring content from its entertainment brands.[7]The original plan for the service called for three tiers with a late 2019 launch.[8]Randall L. Stephenson, chairman and CEO of WarnerMedia's parent,AT&Tindicated in mid-May 2019 that it would use the HBO brand and would tie into cable operators as HBO cable subscribers would have access to the streaming service. A beta was expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a full launch in the first quarter of 2020 at the time.[9]
Otter Mediawas transferred in May 2019 to WarnerMedia Entertainment fromWarner Bros.to take over the streaming service as Brad Bentley, executive vice president and general manager of direct-to-consumer development, exited the post after six months. Andy Forssell transferred from being the chief operating officer of Otter to replace Bentley as executive vice president and general manager while still reporting to Otter CEO Tony Goncalves, who would lead development.[10]
On July 9, 2019, WarnerMedia announced that the service would be known as HBO Max and that it would launch in spring 2020, whileReese Witherspoon'sHello SunshineandGreg Berlantiwere signed to production deals for the service. (The "Max" moniker is shared with HBO's sister linear pay television serviceCinemax, which has alternately identified by its suffix name since the mid-1980s and used it prominently in its branding from 2008 to 2011.)[11]On October 29, 2019, it was announced that HBO Max would officially launch in May 2020.[12]
On January 8, 2020, AT&T announced thatAudience, a channel exclusive to subscribers of AT&T-owned television providers such asDirecTVwith some original programming, would be sunset on May 22, eventually transitioning to abarker channelfor HBO Max.[13]Warner Bros.and HBO Max announced theWarner Maxfilm label on February 5, 2020, which would produce eight to ten mid-budget movies per year for the streaming service starting in 2020.[14]On April 20, 2020, WarnerMedia announced HBO Max's launch date as May 27.[15]Later that year on October 23, it was announced that WarnerMedia decided to consolidate the Warner Max label into the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after its chairman,Toby Emmerich, and his development and production team led by Courtenay Valenti of Warner Bros. Pictures, Richard Brener of New Line and Walter Hamada (who oversees DC-based films), was put to manage the company's entire film output, both theatrical and streaming releases.[16][17][18]
In July 2022, as a part of a cost-cutting and strategic move following the merger ofDiscovery, Inc.with WarnerMedia to formWarner Bros. Discovery(WBD), it was reported that HBO Max had ceased new original series development inCentral Europe,Nordic Europe, the Netherlands, and Turkey, as well as removed selected international series from the platform worldwide. It was reported that France and Spain had been largely excluded from these cuts, due to French regulations requiring streaming services to produce domestic content, and Spanish-language content appealing to a wide range of markets served by HBO Max.[19][20][21]With the cancellation ofGordita Chronicleslater that month, it was reported that the service was also abandoning development of live-action children's and family programming.[22]
On August 3, 2022, it was reported that multiple Max Original films and HBO series had been quietly removed from the service without prior notice as part of cuts to direct-to-streaming films. The company thenwrote offfilms and series that had underperformed on the service.[23][24]It was also thought that avoiding payment forresidualsplayed a part.[25]This followed news that had broken the previous day that then-upcoming Max Original filmsBatgirlandScoob! Holiday Haunthad been both abruptly cancelled, despite being nearly complete.[26][27]During an earnings call the next day, WBD CEODavid Zaslavstated that the company would cut children's programming and emphasize theatrical films over direct-to-streaming releases.[28][29]
Later that month, more programs were pulled from the streaming service, including animated and unscripted series such asThe Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo,Final Space,Summer Camp Island,Infinity Train,Close Enough, and nearly 200 episodes ofSesame Street, among others,[30][31]which was met with heavy backlash from fans, critics, actors, and creators alike.[32][33][34]On August 24, 2022, the HBO Max original filmsHouse Party(which was pulled from its slate just 17 days before its release) andEvil Dead Risewere both shifted to theatrical releases.[35]WBD later reached licensing deals with thefree ad-supported streaming television(FAST) servicesThe Roku ChannelandTubi(owned byFox Corporation) in 2023; the deal covers over 2,000 hours of library programming, some of which being shows that had been pulled from HBO Max.[36][37]
During its third-quarter earnings report in November 2022, WBD stated that the merged service was now targeting a "Spring 2023" launch in the U.S., ahead of the original schedule. Perrette also stated of a potential price increase for HBO Max's ad-free tier in 2023, explaining that it was "an opportunity, particularly in this environment".[38]A price hike for the ad-free tier in the U.S. was later announced on January 12, 2023, which saw the price raised by $1 to $15.99 a month (the yearly plan would be unaffected by this move), effective immediately for new subscribers, while current subscribers would see the price hike starting on February 11, 2023.[39]
On March 14, 2022, after Discovery shareholders approved its merger with WarnerMedia, Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels stated that the company planned to pursue an eventual merger of HBO Max with its own streaming serviceDiscovery+. Wiedenfels stated that this process would most likely begin with a bundle of the two services as a short-term option, with a long-term goal to eventually merge the services into one platform.[40]
During an earnings call in August 2022, WBD head of Global Streaming and Interactive JB Perrette revealed that Discovery+ and HBO Max would merge "next Summer", with the unified service launching first in the United States, and rolled out to other markets beginning in late-2023.[29]When announcing the merged service, Zaslav did not immediately indicate whether it would continue to carry the HBO brand. He stated that HBO was one of the "great crown jewels of the company" and would "always be the beacon and the ultimate brand that stands for the best of television quality".[41]In early-December 2022, it was reported by CNBC via inside sources that multiple names were being considered—including simply "Max".[42][43]
In February 2023, Zaslav revealed during an earnings call that WBD would officially announce the service on April 12.[44]He also announced that WBD would continue operating Discovery+ in conjunction with the service rather than shut it down, stating that it was profitable, and that its subscribers were "very happy with the product offering".[44]One day before the scheduled announcement,The New York Timesconfirmed that the service would be called "Max", and that it would retain HBO Max's existing pricing and be available in multiple price tiers for six months (on December 5 its legacy ad-free tier will be removed with former users in this tier downgrading to the ad-free tier after this date).[45][46]WBD acquired the max.comdomain nameearlier that year from Max International, anutritional supplementcompany.[47]
WBD officially unveiled Max on April 12: the new service would first launch in the United States on May 23, and in other regions throughout 2023 and 2024. While the new service maintains similar price points to HBO Max, support for4K resolutionvideo andDolby Atmosbecame exclusive to the new "Ultimate" tier, and the ad-free plan was also reduced from four concurrent streams to two.[48]In addition to all Warner Bros. Pictures releases from 2023 onward, WBD plans to have more library films and television series available on Max in 4K.[47][49][48]
Perrette explained that the HBO branding had been dropped from the service's name so that it could be associated with itsoriginal programmingas a flagship brand on Max, rather than having to be associated with the entirety of its library—which included children's and family programming at odds with HBO having traditionally been associated withpremiumand adult-oriented programming.[50][51]The Max logo was designed by the British agency DixonBaxi, and incorporates elements of both the HBO and Warner Bros. logos, including a center-dotted "a" resembling the center-dotted "O" from the HBO logo, and the "m" and "x" letters containing curves based on Warner Bros.' long-time shield logo. The service also changed its corporate color from purple to blue, in homage to Warner Bros.' historical use of blue-colored logos.[52][53]
The rebrand was promoted with the tagline "The one to watch".[54][55]Pato Spagnoletto, chief marketing officer of Warner Bros. Discovery Streaming, identified the campaign as the largest marketing spend in company history.[53][56]WBD's stock fell by nearly six percent after Max's announcement.[57]Within the first 3 months of Max's rebrand, WBD lost 1.8 million subscribers across their streaming platforms, but attributed it to an overlap of subscribers of Max and Discovery+, as well as expected churn.[58]In November 2023, it was reported that WBD lost 2.5 million subscribers over a six-month period, with their shares falling 19% as a result.[59]
In May 2024, WBD announced a partnership with Disney to offer a bundle of Max with its competitorsDisney+andHuluin the United States, It was launched on July 25, 2024, at a price of $16.99 per-month for ad-supported, and $29.99 per-month for ad-free.[60][61]
Existing HBO Max subscribers were grandfathered under their current plan features for least six months, following that period all legacy ad free customers were moved to the ad free tier (existing ad supported were moved to the ad lite tier).[64][46]
HBO Max was formed under WarnerMedia's Entertainment division, then headed byRobert Greenblatt.Kevin Reilly, president of WarnerMedia Entertainment Networks, which includes most of the company's ad-supported entertainment channels such asTBS,TNT, andTruTV, was also given the role of as chief content officer of HBO Max with responsibility for HBO Max-exclusive original programming and library content. Andy Forssell was named the service's executive vice president and general manager while still reporting toOtter MediaCEO Tony Goncalves, who leads development.[11]Casey Bloys, programming president of HBO, retained oversight of the core HBO service but was not initially involved with Max-exclusive programming.
On August 7, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a significant restructuring under new presidentJason Kilar, which he described as "leaning into this great moment of change" towards direct-to-consumer services. As a result, Greenblatt and Reilly both left the company. WarnerMedia Entertainment was dissolved, with programming operations combined with Warner Bros. in a new Studios and Networks group under that studio's CEO Ann Sarnoff. Bloys was given complete programming oversight of HBO and HBO Max, as well as Reilly's other previous responsibilities, reporting to Sarnoff. Forssell became the head of a new HBO Max operating business unit, reporting directly to Kilar.[65]On April 23, 2021,Adult Swimand HBO Max's adult animation development teams merged under the leadership of Suzanna Makkos.[66]
On August 15, 2022, HBO was reorganized by Warner Bros. Discovery, resulting in layoffs within HBO Max's non-scripted originals, live-action family originals, international originals, and casting units (HBO itself never had an in-house casting department). Makkos also began reporting to HBO's head of comedy Amy Gravitt.[67][68]
Max features first-run and library content from HBO and other Warner Bros. film and television studios and brands.[69][70][71]The service also includes films available through HBO's existing pay television rights that are sourced fromWarner Bros. Picturesonly.[70][72][73][74]
As with HBO's other streaming platforms,HBO GoandHBO Now(but as opposed to its add-on services onPrime Video Channels,YouTube Primetime Channelsand, until its removal from that platform in 2021,Apple TV Channels), Max originally did not include feeds of HBO's linear cable channels,[75]nor does it include any content fromCinemax.[76]Though Cinemax shares its film content with the linear HBO channel, and therefore the majority of films in the combined library will be on both services in different windows, these films will not necessarily be available on both Max and Cinemax at the same time.[77]
On December 4, 2024, Max added a “Channels” tab offering live feeds of HBO and its linear multiplex channels (with the exception of HBO Family and HBO Latino). Initially available on a limited basis to U.S. subscribers of Max’s Ad-Free and Ultimate Ad-Free tiers using adult profiles, the feature will allow users to restart, rewind and fast-forward, and navigate between streams of the linear channel feeds directly from within the player.[78][79]
First and third-party content providers for Max. Asterisk (*) denotes third parties while cross (†) denotes former providers.
Original content produced will be under the bannerMax Originals, including series, films, and specials.Original episodic content is released weekly, eschewing the "binge" format made popular byNetflix.Kevin Reillystated this was to ensure that originals would remain in the spotlight for extended periods, by letting said shows "breathe" as opposed to "fading quickly after a binge and burn". He also noted that the weekly schedule helped to drive the success of past HBO shows likeSuccessionandChernobylwhich they co-produced withSky UK, and became hits precisely due to their staying power.[87]
A slate of 31 original series were planned for its first year, with plans to expand to 50 for its next year, but production timelines may have been interrupted by theCOVID-19 pandemic.[70]Max also has podcasts about the films and TV series on the service.[90]It also produces original podcasts exclusively for the service, withBatman: The Audio Adventuresbeing the first.[91]
NewWarner Bros.-produced television series that have premiered onThe CWsince the2019–20 seasonbeginning withBatwoman,Nancy DrewandKaty Keene(which was cancelled in July 2020) will have their past seasons placed on Max about a month after the season finale airs on television (streaming rights to existing series remains with Netflix under an existing deal).[11]Although theAll Americanspin-off,All American: Homecoming, which premiered on the CW in 2022, was placed onNetflixwith its parent show. On July 9, 2019, HBO Max acquired the U.S. streaming rights toFriendsin a $425 million deal,[11][70]and on September 17, 2019, acquired the U.S. streaming rights toThe Big Bang Theory, as part of a deal that also extends TBS's off-network rights to the series through 2028.[92]
Outside of Warner Bros. Discovery, the service also offers titles fromThe Criterion Collection,[93]and has a long-term partnership withBBC Studios(which HBO had previously partnered with to createHis Dark Materials). Over 700 episodes of BBC content were available on the service at launch, including the first 11 seasons of the 2005Doctor Whorevival, as well as future seasons twelve through fourteen, and a variety of other shows includingThe Honourable Woman,Luther,Top Gear, and the original British version ofThe Office. Additionally, future shows by BBC Studios will be co-produced with Max.[94]

Select episodes from all fifty seasons ofSesame Street(dating back to 1969) are available to stream on the service for the first time ever.[95]Additionally, future seasons ofSesame Streetwill stream exclusively on Max until 2025, alongsideEsme & Roy, and several new spin-offs starting withThe Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo,Sesame Street: Mecha Builders, andThe Monster at the End of This Story.[96]On March 8, 2022, WarnerMedia and Sesame Workshop announced they will plan new shows for Cartoon Network for the new original series run and a second run acquisition rights HBO Max, includingCharlotte's Web, andBea's Blockas well as the animation specialSesame Street: The Nutcracker.

In late 2020, due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, WarnerMedia moved two Warner Bros. films originally intended as major theatrical releases to either exclusive or simultaneous releases on HBO Max.The Witcheswas released exclusively on HBO Max in the U.S. on October 22,[133]andWonder Woman 1984debuted simultaneously in North American theaters and on HBO Max on December 25, although the latter was initially only available on the service for a month.[134]Week-long free trials were discontinued in December 2020.[135]
On December 3, 2020, it was announced that the studio's entire 2021 film lineup would see a simultaneous theatrical release and a one-month limited release on the streaming service, starting withThe Little Thingson January 29.[136]Subsequent films released under the same-day theatrical/streaming window to date wereJudas and the Black Messiah(February 12),[137][138]Tom and Jerry(February 26),Godzilla vs. Kong(March 31),Mortal Kombat(April 23),Those Who Wish Me Dead(May 14),The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It(June 4),In the Heights(June 10),Space Jam: A New Legacy(July 16),The Suicide Squad(August 5),Reminiscence(August 20),Malignant(September 10),Cry Macho(September 17),The Many Saints of Newark(October 1),Dune(October 22),King Richard(November 19), andThe Matrix Resurrections(December 22). Standard release windows applied to each film after their initial limited-run streaming release on the service; HBO Max would then reassume streaming rights to the aforementioned Warner Bros. films upon their respective pay television premieres on the linear HBO service in mid-to-late 2021 or 2022, depending on the scheduled start of their individual HBO exhibition agreements.[139][140]
This decision, called "Project Popcorn" within Warner Bros.,[141]was met with backlash from filmmakers, production companies, theDirectors Guild of America, theCreative Artists Agency, and movie theater owners as Warner Bros. had not informed anyone about their plan ahead of the announcement.[142][143][144][145][146]Viewership of the films varied, withMortal Kombatreaching 3.8 million,The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do Ittotaling 1.6 million, andIn the Heightstotaling 693,000 (according toSamba TV, as WarnerMedia does not report viewership numbers for HBO Max).[147]
Warner Bros. spent over $200million alone compensating talent for the shift to streaming;Deadlinereported in January 2022 that such a business move "will never occur again given its high cost".[141]
In March 2021, it was announced that Warner Bros. would discontinue same-day releases in 2022, as part of an agreement the studio reached withCineworld(who operatesRegal Cinemas) and will instead use a 45-day exclusive release window for theaters.[148]The Matrix Resurrectionswas the final film released in 2021 as part of Project Popcorn. The 45-day release window for HBO Max was only used for two films (The BatmanandFantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore) before it was reported in August 2022 that as part of a restructuring of Warner Bros' film distribution strategy following the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc, the length of the window would now be decided for each film on a case-by-case basis.[149]

CNN had previously attempted a standalone subscription service in 2022,CNN+, but was closed almost immediately after the completion of the WarnerMedia/Discovery merger due to it conflicting with the company's goal of having one streaming service to encompass all WBD properties.[153][154]

On October 5, 2023, Max announced plans to launch a new sports-focused tier in the United States, to be known initially as theBleacher ReportSports add-on. The tier would feature live sporting events and studio shows fromTNT Sports, includingMajor League Baseball(MLB), theNational Basketball Association(NBA), theNational Hockey League(NHL), and theNCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, as well as exclusive USA Soccer matches and programs, and select on-demand content.[158][159]On December 14, 2023, amid the closure of theGCN+service, WBD announced that its programming rights would be consolidated into the sports add-on in February 2024, including theGiro d'Italiaand variousUCItours and events.[160]
The service was to be available as a free preview until February 29, 2024, after which it was to become an $9.99 add-on on top of an existing Max subscription. However, amid changes to TNT Sports' portfolio (including its impending loss of rights to the NBA in 2025, and other acquisitions such as college sports and international events such as theFrench Open), the launch of the sports add-on as a paid service was delayed indefinitely.[158][159]On February 26, 2025, it was announced that the add-on had been scrapped as part of a change in strategy, and that live sports content would be available at no additional charge as part of the "Standard" and "Premium" tiers of Max (as B/R sports on Max). JB Perrette stated that WBD had been "actively involved in exploring ways to evolve the sports distribution ecosystem in the U.S.", and that offering sports content as part of the existing tiers was the best option for subscribers.[161][162]
Similar to the Bleacher Report Sports add-on in the United States, a sports-focused tier will be added to Max in Europe during its launch over the summer of 2024 in conjunction with its pan-European sports brandEurosport. This tier will offer the linear channelsEurosport 1andEurosport 2, and coverage for various sports events including the2024 Summer Olympics, Giro d'Italia,Vuelta a España, andTour de France.[152]
On July 9, 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery announced thatTNT Sportswill arrive at Max in Chile the week of July 15 with an innovative proposal where sports fans will be able to subscribe independently or by adding it to the platform's available plans. It will include live events and original content.
The most relevant Chilean soccer competitions are added, such as theChilean Primera División,Primera B,Copa Chileand original programming, among others.[1]
From February 2025,TNT Sportscontent will be available to users with a subscription toPack Fútbolwith their enabled cable operator and to TNT Sports subscribers independently.
From October 24, 2024, in Spain, Max has added a newMax DAZNpackage that will cost €44.99 per month, in addition to the Sports package that is optional for the Standard and Premium plans, it includes fourDAZNchannels in addition toEurosportwith the best sport that fans could wish for.
LaLiga, theUFC, or theFormula 1andMotoGPworld championships will be available to subscribers of theMax DAZNPackage, in addition to having all the movies, series and documentaries on the platform with the same advantages as the Premium Plan[163]
At launch, HBO Max did not support4K,HDR,Dolby Vision, orDolby Atmos, but support for these technologies were planned as "part of the HBO Max product roadmap".[164][165]Support for 4K, HDR, and Atmos was added starting with the release ofWonder Woman 1984,[166][non-primary source needed]with WarnerMedia promising to add more content in these formats throughout 2021 and beyond.[167]
The service providedclosed captioningsupport at launch, but initially lacked support foraudio description(AD) for those with visual impairments.[168]In October 2020, theAmerican Council of the Blindannounced it had reached a settlement with WarnerMedia whereby at least 1,500 hours of HBO Max content will be available with AD by the end of March 2021, increasing to at least 6,000 hours by March 2023, along with otheraccessibilityenhancements to the website and apps by September 2021.[169]HBO Max later began rolling out AD on select titles on March 26, 2021.[170]
The majority of active subscribers to the HBO pay TV service (which previously included HBO Go), and most customers that were subscribed to HBO Now at time of launch, can access HBO Max for no extra charge, with all three services generally sharing the same price point of $14.99 per month. However, this transition is contingent on the customer's current provider or biller having signed a new distribution agreement for HBO Max with WarnerMedia.[75][171]
On May 27, 2020, as part of an agreement with Time Warner that renewed its carriage contract for theTurner Broadcasting Systemnetworks and gave its over-the-top television serviceSling TVdistribution rights to the linear HBO channel.Dish Networksecured an option to become a distribution partner for HBO Max following the exclusivity period with Apple.[172][173]HBO content is also available as a premium add-on forDirecTV StreamandHulufor the same $14.99 price as HBO Max.[174]
In announcing HBO Max, WarnerMedia immediately confirmed that HBO subscribers on AT&T-owned platforms (includingAT&T TV,DirecTV,U-verse, andAT&T Mobility) would receive HBO Max on-launch at no additional charge.[175][176]AT&T customers who are subscribed to their highest-tiered internet, TV and wireless plans would also receive HBO Max for free, while those on lower-tiered plans will get a free trial ranging from one month to one year.[177]Existing HBO Now subscribers billed directly by HBO were also migrated to HBO Max on-launch at no additional charge. On April 27, 2020, an agreement was announced for HBO Now subscribers via Apple (both in-app subscriptions andApple TV Channels) to be migrated to HBO Max. Content from HBO Max would be listed in theApple TV appalong with there being a dedicated HBO Max hub in the app.[178][179]OnApple TVdevices, HBO Max is available to the regular fourth generation Apple TV and fifth and sixth generationApple TV 4K; earlier versions which do not support third-party app download are not supported.
WarnerMedia subsequently negotiated with other pay TV providers for similar arrangements.[171]On February 20, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a distribution deal withYouTube TVthat would allow members to add HBO and Cinemax, while also being able to include HBO Max as an add-on.[180]On April 15, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a similar deal withCharterSpectrum(which acquired Warner's formercable divisionafter it was spun off in 2009, in May 2016) to give access to HBO Max for HBO subscribers via theirTV Everywherecredentials.[181]A similar agreement was announced withHuluon May 1 for most existing subscribers via Hulu + Live TV, as well as being available as an add-on to all other plans on the service.[182]On May 20, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia had made distribution deals withAltice USA,Cox Communications,Xbox,Samsung,PlayStation,Verizon Communicationsand the National Cable Television Cooperative (NCTC).[183]An agreement withComcast(Xfinity) was announced a few hours after the platform's launch.[184]Max is also available onXfinityFlex andCoxContour Stream Player.[185][186]
The most prominent platforms without agreements to carry HBO Max at the launch wereAmazon(maker of theFire TVandFire HDdevices) andRoku, which together are estimated to control 70% of the U.S. streaming player market.[184]With both platforms, non-Max HBO content remained available as usual through the companies' respective channels platforms and/or through HBO Now (which was rebranded to just "HBO" on July 31, 2020) while deals for HBO Max were being worked out. On May 13, 2020,John Stankey, CEO of AT&T, revealed toVarietythat Amazon was very unlikely to become a launch partner for HBO Max; the parties have remained at an impasse following the launch, reportedly due to a disagreement about whether Amazon can host the additional Max programming directly on itsAmazon Prime VideoChannels platform as it does for HBO currently.[187][184]On November 16, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia and Amazon had reached an agreement to make HBO Max available on Fire TV and Fire Tablet devices beginning the following day, while also allowing subscribers of HBO via Prime Video Channels access to the HBO Max app at no extra cost (although the additional Max programming will still not be hosted on the Prime Video Channels platform).[188]The dispute with Roku was reported to hinge on carriage commissions and advertising sales on the future ad-supported tier.[184]On December 16, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia and Roku had reached an agreement to make HBO Max available on Roku devices beginning the following day, while also allowing subscribers of HBO via Roku Channels access to the HBO Max app at no extra cost (although the additional Max programming would still not be hosted on the Roku Channels platform); conversely, Roku remote controls from the past five years which included an HBO Now app shortcut button now route viewers directly to the HBO Max app instead.[189]Dish Networkwas also erroneously mentioned as a holdout in some media reports; HBO has not been available at all from Dish since late 2018 due to a separate dispute.[190]On July 29, 2021, WarnerMedia and Dish announced that they had reached an agreement to resolve the dispute and restore HBO to Dish's satellite service, along with offering access to HBO Max to HBO subscribers via Dish at no extra cost.[191]
There were plans for HBO Max to introduce an ad-supported tier by 2021,[192]with AT&T later announcing during their Investor Day event on March 12, 2021, that the tier would launch in June of the same year.[193]HBO original programming will continue to be ad-free for subscribers of the tier, but the tier will not allow access to Same-Day Premieres.[194]WarnerMedia later announced during their 2021 upfront presentation on May 19 that the ad-supported tier would launch during the first week of June at a price point of $9.99 a month.[195]The tier would end up launching on June 3, while also adding a yearly option for both tiers (priced at $99.99 a year for the ad-supported tier and $149.99 a year for the ad-free tier).[196]
Localized versions of HBO Max launched on June 29, 2021, in Latin America and the Caribbean,[197]on October 26, 2021, in Andorra, Spain and the Nordics (excluding Iceland), and on March 8, 2022, in Central and Eastern Europe and Portugal, in part by converting existing streaming services operated by HBO in some of those markets to the HBO Max platform.[198][199]In the interim, some HBO Max original programs have been made available on WarnerMedia's existing international platforms, also includingHBO Asia.[200][201]The European launches of HBO Max featured a notable promotion, offering the service with a 50% discount "for life" for new subscribers as long as they maintain their subscription.[202]
In other countries, HBO and/or Max original programs are licensed tothird-party networks and streaming servicesunder long-term deals. In these cases, Max has left it up to individual rightsholders to decide whether to offer its programming on an over-the-top basis. The extent and lengths of the deals vary by country; not all networks that carry HBO programs also carry Max programs, and in some cases individual programs are carried by different services.[203][204][205]
WarnerMedia said in late 2019 that it planned to continue HBO's existing international licensing partnerships for the time being.[206]However, as part of the WarnerMedia further restructuring announced in August 2020, WarnerMedia presidentJason Kilarsaid HBO Max would be expanding its scope globally.[65]Operations chief Andy Forssell indicated later that year that the company ultimately plans to have HBO Max active in 190 countries, but that a timeline for most of the remaining countries had not been decided.[199]
Following the merger of WarnerMedia with Discovery, Inc. in April 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery has decided to halt international expansion of HBO Max in favor of waiting to replace the existing service, as well as HBO Go in Asia-Pacific region, with Max, and instead continuing to license its content to other international distributors such asSky EuropeandFoxtelin markets where HBO Max isn't available, in an attempt to reach financial stability for the company.[207]This also included postponing the launch of Max in France and Belgium until the summer 2024, despite there already being plans to launch the service as HBO Max in 2023.[208]Plans for expansion of Max are expected to restart sometime in 2026, beginning with the regions where Sky Europe operates,[209]although the service has continued to expand before then, but in the form of an additional VOD hub for existing pay TV operators in countries like New Zealand, Japan and Greece.[210][211][212]
HBO Max was launched on June 29, 2021, in the 39 territories of Latin America and the Caribbean, where HBO already operated directly its streaming service HBO Go, and premium television channels.[213][214]HBO Max in Latin America and the Caribbean was rebranded as Max on February 27, 2024.[215]
Max does not operate in Canada;[216]rights to most Max Original programming produced by Warner Bros. or its subsidiaries are held byBell Media, which distributes them via its OTT serviceCrave, and its English- and French-language pay television servicesCraveandSuper Écran(which themselves include access to the OTT version of Crave viaTV Everywherecredentials). The agreement was first announced in 2019, also renewing Crave's existing rights to first-run HBO programming (Bell operates anHBO channelas a multiplex of Crave) and pay-one rights to Warner Bros. Pictures releases. It does not include the rights to series produced for the service by third-party studios.[203][217][218]The agreement was most recently renewed in 2024 for an unspecified length.[219]
The Bell agreement has excluded some of Max's youth, family, and animation programming, which have often been picked up byCorus Entertainmentfor its specialty channels, such asCartoon Network,Treehouse, andAdult Swim[220](in conjunction with the company's long-standing output agreement withCartoon Network).[221][222][223][224][225]
Under a long-term agreement until 2024 between HBO andSky Group(Comcast), Sky operatesSky Atlanticwhich broadcasts the majority of HBO's programming. Sky Atlantic is available in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy. In February 2011,Sky Atlanticlaunched on the Sky platforms in theUnited KingdomandIreland, which maintains a distribution deal with HBO to offer the majority of its programming on the channel. Under the five-year agreement between HBO and Sky, newer HBO programs will air on Sky Atlantic before airing on other television channels within the United Kingdom and Ireland. Before 2011,TG4in Ireland had a long-term agreement to broadcast HBO programming free-to-air, this ceased following the creation of Sky Atlantic. In many other countries, Max has licensed exclusive rights to its programming to television networks owned by third parties, includingSky Atlanticin theUnited Kingdom.
In March 2021, WarnerMedia confirmed that HBO Max would not launch in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy before 2025 due to an existing deal for HBO programming withSky Groupwhich was renewed in 2019 but does not automatically include Max Originals produced by third-party companies or Warner Bros. Television themselves.[226][227][228]
On December 9, 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery and Sky announced a brand new non-exclusive bundling partnership in the UK and Ireland, where Max is expected to launch in early 2026. Following its launch, Sky customers will gain access to the ad-supported version of Max at no additional cost.[229]
On August 15, 2012, HBO announced plans to launchHBO Nordic, a multiplatform video distribution service servingNorway,Denmark,SwedenandFinlandthat was created through a joint venture with Parsifal International.[230][231]Thevideo on demandservice launched in December 2012.[232]HBO programming also airs inIcelandonStöð 2.[233]In Spain, HBO programs were previously broadcast on pay television serviceCanal+, since 2011.[234]In 2016, during the discontinuation of the Canal+ branding in Spain, HBO launched a standalone streaming service called HBO España, which was the Spanish equivalent of HBO Now and HBO Nordic.
HBO Europehad announced on multiple occasions that they were not aware that they were going to replace their current service with HBO Max, nor would their rates be increased.[235]However, in December 2020, the head of HBO Max, Andy Forssell, revealed that all HBO services in Europe, including HBO España and HBO Nordic, would be replaced by HBO Max. On October 26, 2021, HBO Max was launched in the Nordics (excluding Iceland) and Spain and Andorra.[236][237]
Starting in 2024, HBO Max's programming began to be integrated as part of more expensive packages in the Spanish TV service Movistar Plus+ with all programming from the service becoming available on Movistar Plus+ by April 2024.[238][239]The rebranding to Max went into effect on May 21, 2024.[240][241]On September 17, 2024, a linear TV channel dedicated to broadcasting HBO and Max content was launched, exclusively on Movistar Plus+, as Max Avances.[242]
In the 2010s,HBO Europelaunched streaming serviceHBO Goin 13Central and Eastern Europeancountries. HBO programs in Portugal were previously broadcast on the premium television channel TVSéries from the services ofTVCine, since 2015. In 2019, less than a year before the discontinuation of TVSeries, HBO Europe launched a standalone streaming service called HBO Portugal. Similarly to the Nordics and Spain, HBO Max was launched in Portugal[243]and Central and Eastern Europe on March 8, 2022,[244]replacing HBO Portugal and HBO Go.
The rebranding to Max went into effect on May 21, 2024,[241]except in Poland where it took place on June 11.[245]The Max rebranding in Poland also gave the option to live stream all ofTVN Warner Bros. Discovery's linear television networks as part of the Sports add-on, except Cinemax 1 and Cinemax 2. Meanwhile, Polish users not subscribed to extra add-on will be able to only live stream the threeHBOchannels in Poland and the free to air networkTVN.
On November 13, 2008,OrangelaunchedOrange Cinéma Séries(renamed OCS in 2012), a five-channel package, dedicated to movie and series. The same year, OCS signed a long-term agreement with HBO. On October 10, 2013, they launched the channel OCS City (initially nicknamed Génération HBO) to broadcast only HBO productions. The HBO catalog was also available to stream on their streaming service. From 2019 to 2023, OCS had the complete exclusivity on the HBO catalog in France. Before that, other channels likeCanal+,Canal+ SériesorNT1could aired reruns of selected HBO series after their original run on OCS.[246]However, OCS didn't have the rights on the Max catalogue. The deal ended in December 2022, with HBO productions leaving OCS from January 2023 onwards.[247]
In October 2021, formerCanal+executive Vera Peltekian was appointed as VP and commissioning editor of original HBO Max programming forFrance. HBO Max's launch in France was set for 2023, but this ended up getting delayed after Warner Bros. Discovery decided to halt the global rollout of HBO Max to replace the existing service with Max first.[208]Meanwhile,Canal+, theTF1 Group, andWarner TVbroadcast a selection of the Warner Bros.-produced scripted live-action Max Original series, certain films and reunion specials. Programs not owned by Warner Bros. (likeLionsgate'sLove Life) have been licensed separately to other French broadcasters.
In October 2022,Amazon Prime Videosigned a deal withWarner Bros. Discoveryto distribute the HBO Max programs owned by Warner Bros. in France.[248]In January 2023, it was announced that the deal was extended to all HBO productions, following the expiration of the deal with OCS for HBO productions, but also to Warner Bros. Discovery's linear TV channels, following the end of the deal withCanal+for their carriage. All this content where available on the service through Le Pass Warner ("The Warner Pass"), asubscription-based channel, launched on March 16, 2023. Selected programs (likeThe Last of Us,Peacemaker,Pretty Little Liars: Original SinandThe Sex Lives of College Girls) where released without a subscription to the channel for a limited time. The Warner Pass was removed from the service following the launch of Max in France with its subscribers automatically transferred to a Max subscription.[249]
The service was launched as Max in France on June 11, 2024. In France, the service also include an access to Warner Bros. Discovery's French linear TV channels (Warner TV,Warner TV Nextand others), similar to the service's offer in Poland, and the option to subscribe to a sports-focused add-on that include various live sports events and an access toEurosport's linear channels. During the2024 Summer Olympics, the service shared the broadcast withFrance Télévisions, and covered the event for all subscribers, even those without the sports add-on.[245][250]The service's ad-free plan is also available as a subscription-based channel on others services like Amazon Prime Video or Canal+.
On February 9, 2012,HBO Netherlandsstarted as a joint venture between HBO and Dutch cable operatorZiggo. HBO Netherlands aired as a three-channel multiplex service in addition to offering a localized version ofHBO Goto subscribers. HBO Netherlands was not limited to subscribers of Ziggo, instead, many Dutch cable operators offered HBO Netherlands. However, on September 28, 2016, HBO Netherlands announced that it would cease operations on December 31, 2016. That same day, it was announced that Ziggo had bought exclusive rights to HBO programming.[251]On November 1, 2016, it was announced that Ziggo will offer HBO programming exclusively as part of their newMovies & Seriesservice starting from January 2017.[252]In September 2021, it was reported that Ziggo's rights to HBO programming is set to expire at the end of the year.[253]Ziggo confirmed that its HBO programming rights are set to expire on January 1, 2022, as a result of WarnerMedia launching HBO Max in The Netherlands in 2022. However, some recently aired seasons will remain on theMovies & Seriesservice.[254]
On February 1, 2022, the launch date was officially announced for March 8, 2022.[255]
In Belgium, HBO and Max programing was broadcast through the pay TV operatorsBeTVand Streamz (Telenet).[256][257]
The Max rebranding in the Netherlands took place on June 11, 2024, alongside a soft launch in Belgium, before its full launch on July 1,[152][245]but the "HBO Max" name retained due to trademark conflicts withOmroep MAX, a member of theDutch public broadcasting system, as well as VRT MAX, a streaming platform by theVRT.[258][259]
Turkey and Greece
Plans to introduce HBO Max in certain Eastern European countries where HBO Go was absent, such as Turkey and Greece were announced in October 2021,[260]but these plans were later halted, withVodafoneTV in Greece and various TV operators in Turkey, includingDigiturk, instead getting the rights for various HBO and Max programming.[261][262]
On December 6, 2023,Warner Bros. Discovery(WBD) fully acquired the turkish streaming serviceBluTV,[263][264]and on December 5, 2024, it was announced that BluTV would be relaunched as Max sometime in the spring of 2025, as part of WBD's global streaming consolidation strategy.[265]

Fox Showcase, an Australian premium television service, began airing HBO original programming in 2012, through a licensed distribution arrangement with subscription television providerFoxtel. Before this, limited HBO content was broadcast through the now-defunctMovie Network, which was founded by HBO (throughTime Warner),Village Roadshow,Metro-Goldwyn-MayerandDisney–ABC International Television. HBO Originals are also available on-demand via Foxtel servicesFoxtel NowandBinge.Sky MoviesinNew Zealandoriginally operated as a joint venture between HBO andSky Network Television. The channel was renamed HBO in 1993; Time Warner later sold its share in the service to Sky in 1998, and it was renamed back to Sky Movies. HBO programming is currently shown by Sky channelHBO, and its subscription streaming serviceNeon, in New Zealand. Deals with some other partners includingFoxtelin Australia andSkyin New Zealand which includes a significant portion of HBO Max's original programming were agreed or renewed between 2019 and 2021.[204][266][210]
Foxtel and Warner Bros Discovery renewed their partnership in February 2023, making HBO and Warner Bros. content available across Foxtel's pay-TV channels as well as its Foxtel Now and Binge streaming services.[207]However, in a press release, Warner Bros. Discovery president and managing director for Western Pacific, James Gibbons, said the renewed deal with Foxtel "also provides optionality for future collaboration, including for our future streaming service", perhaps hinting at plans to launch Max in Australia in the future.[267]
In mid October 2024, Warner Bros Discovery and Sky New Zealand signed a new partnership agreement that would allow Sky to remain the exclusive distributor of bothHBOand Max content in New Zealand from 30 October 2024. Under the partnership, Sky New Zealand would host Max as a hub on its Sky Box, Sky Pod andSky Goplatforms and its Neon streaming service. The SoHo channel would also be revamped as a linear HBO channel featuringHBO Originalcontent.[210][268]
On February 25, 2025,Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)announced that Max would be launched as a standalone service in Australia on March 31, 2025.[269]CEO and President of Global Streaming and Games, JB Perrette, stated that "Australia represents one of our biggest new markets and a significant opportunity to delight even more fans with the incredible stories told by our iconic brands". It will launch with a range of subscription plans, including 'Basic with Ads', although details on pricing and content were not stated.FoxtelandBingewill lose access to mostHBOand Max Originals, but Foxtel subscribers will be provided a 'Basic with Ads' plan at no extra cost if they have a compatible Foxtel IQ box.[270][271]
In June 2021, WarnerMedia appointed a managing director for the launch of HBO Max in eight territories across Southeast Asia and the exploration of the possibilities to launch HBO Max in theIndianmarket.[272]
Warner Bros. Discovery India decided to premiere their HBO Max original programming, including their original films, onAmazon Prime Video,[273]and onDisney+ Hotstar(until 2023) due to a previously established deal in 2016.[274]It later moved toViacom18'sJioCinemaon May 1, 2023.[275][276]On February 14th, 2025, JioCinema merged with Disney+ Hotstar to form JioHotstar which integrates HBO contents that were previously on JioCinema.[277]
Originally, HBO Max was planned to launch in Southeast Asia, but was halted.[49]Instead, it launched as Max in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, Hong Kong, and Taiwan on 19 November 2024, replacing theHBO GoAsia services.[278]
In Japan,U-Nextreached a deal to carry HBO and HBO Max original programs in Japan beginning on April 1, 2021. This replaced a previous deal between HBO andAmazon Prime VideoJapan.[279]This deal between Warner Bros. Discovery and U-Next was renewed in March 2023, making the streaming service the home of HBO content in the country in a "multi-year" deal between the two. On September 18, 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery signed an exclusive partnership agreement with U-Next. The deal will allow Max to launch within the U-Next system featuring a library of more than 2,500 works and 16,000 episodes from 8 brands including HBO, Max Originals,Harry Potter, DC, Warner Bros., Cartoon Network, Discovery Channel, and Animal Planet. It officially launched on September 25, 2024 at 2:00 p.m.[211][280]
OSNcurrently carries HBO content across 22 countries in the Middle East and North Africa region on its linear channels as well as itsOSN+streaming service. An exclusive, multi-year licensing deal was renewed in March 2023, meaning a Max launch is unlikely in this region in the near future.
HBO Max received mixed reception from media observers on launch. The range of available content was generally well received, but many commented on the likelihood of confusion with HBO's other since-deprecated streaming platforms, HBO Go and HBO Now, and the service's higher subscription price compared to other newly launched streaming platforms likeDisney+.[75][309][310]Television critics also expressed frustration that thelibrary of original series(not including its former late night adult content) for sister network Cinemax was not originally available on HBO Max, though much of its output had arrived on the service by the end of 2021.[311]
AT&T announced in July 2020 that HBO Max had nominally achieved 26.6 million subscribers after its first month of operation, including 23.6 million wholesale customers, primarily legacy HBO pay TV subscribers that were covered by new agreements that added access to HBO Max at no extra charge.[312]However, only 4.1 million customers had activated their HBO Max accounts by the same date.[312]The latter figure was seen by many observers as a disappointment, particularly in light of Disney+ having reached 10 million subscribers within a day of launch;The New York Times's media criticBen Smithwrote that WarnerMedia had "badly botched" the launch.[313]
However, AT&T executives contended that it had been a "flawless launch" citing increased customer engagement compared to HBO Now and overall growth in total subscriptions to either HBO or HBO Max (36.3 million, vs. 34.6 million HBO or HBO Now subscribers at the end of 2019), while acknowledging that there was more to do to persuade existing HBO subscribers to start using the HBO Max apps.[314]Executives had previously noted that HBO Max was starting from a different place than other streaming services as it was building on the existing HBO subscriber base, and had to work within the constraints of many of HBO's pre-existing deals (such as those with Amazon and Roku).[315]
In October 2020, AT&T revealed that the number of activated HBO Max subscribers had reached 8.6 million by the end of September, while the number of nominal (eligible) subscribers reached 28.7 million. The total number of HBO / HBO Max subscriptions in the U.S. also increased to 28 million.[316]With an agreement being reached the following month with Amazon (which is reported to have had 5 million HBO subscribers through Prime Video Channels), the number of HBO Max-eligible subscribers is understood to have increased to over 33 million.[188]In September 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery was sued by a shareholder, alleging that WarnerMedia had overstated the number of HBO Max subscribers by including unactivated subscriptions bundled with AT&T services.[317][318]
Upon its launch, it was noted that Max had grouped directors and writers for its films and television series under a singular "creators" credit.[319]TheDirectors Guild of AmericaandWriters Guild of America Westcondemned the move amidst the2023 Hollywood labor disputes. Max announced that they would fix the credits, agreeing with the outcry from the guilds regarding proper credit for its creators, noting the altered credits were a result of "an oversight in the technical transition" from HBO Max to Max.[320]Deadline Hollywoodreported the consolidation was a result of WBD's IT departments creating the "catch all" for the credits to be in place for launch, and that executives, who could have intervened, had been unaware of the single credit until the discourse arose online after its launch. Additionally, it was reported that it would take "weeks" to fix, given the service would need to make the adjustment on each platform.[321]The credits would later be fixed, beginning in late June.[322]

Jenkins was born inVictorville, California,[5]to William T. Jenkins, a U.S. Air Force officer andfighter pilotwho earned aSilver Starin theVietnam War, and Emily Roth, who later worked inSan Franciscoas an environmental scientist.[6]Her older sister is Elaine Roth, her younger sister is Jessica Jenkins Murphy.[5]
She spent her early childhood moving frequently due to her father's military service. Having lived briefly inThailandandGermany, the family eventually settled inLawrence, Kansas. When she was seven years old, her father died during aNATOmock dogfight at the age of 31. During a road trip from Kansas to San Francisco, her mother dropped Jenkins and her sister off at a movie theater, where they watched the originalSupermanstarringChristopher Reeve. Jenkins found the film inspiring, and the experience sparked an interest in pursuing filmmaking as a career.[7]
She completed kindergarten through her junior year of high school while living in Lawrence. Her mother then moved the family toWashington, D.C., where Patty completed her senior year of high school.[8]She received her undergraduate degree in Painting[9]fromThe Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Artin 1993,[10]and a master's degree in directing from theAmerican Film Institute'sAFI Conservatoryin 2000.[11]While a student at AFI, Jenkins, an avid fan of the films ofPedro Almodóvar, made the 2001 short filmVelocity Rules, that she describes as a cross between asuperhero filmand Almodóvar's tone about an accident-prone housewife.[12]
Beginning in junior high school, Jenkins took interest inphotography,paintingandscreen-printing. At age 20, while interning at a commercial production company, she heeded a suggestion that she could receive film training if she worked on set for free. After doing so for some months, Jenkins advanced tosecond assistant cameraandfocus puller, then spent eight years as acameraperson. While shooting aMichael Jacksonmusic video, herdirector of photographyrecommended that she attend theAmerican Film Instituteto learndirecting. She later made a superheroshort filmthat played atAFI Fest. There she metBrad Wyman, who later introduced her to producerDonald Kushner, leading to her directing her first feature film,Monster(2003).[13]
Patty Jenkins started her career withJust Drives(2001) as her first film as director, she would later follow it up withVelocity Rules(2001). This film follows a housewife who finds out she is a superhero and then has to choose between a life of excitement and glamour or her husband. The film ended up being a Recipient of the Warner Brothers Production Grant.[14]
This ended up moving her towards the filmMonster(2003); at first she tried to get producerBrad Wymanto direct, but under his advice she ended up writing the script herself. Jenkins ended up writing to the film's subject, serial killerAileen Wuornos, who was a street prostitute who went on a 1989–1990 murder spree of seven of her male clients, and was at the time on death row. Wuornos was initially distrustful of Jenkins but on the night before her execution, left Jenkins all of her personal letters which convinced Jenkins that she was the only one who could direct the film.[9]
With a budget of $1.5 million[3]andCharlize Theronattached to the film,Monsterended up being a commercial and critical success, grossing $64.2 million and earning Theron her first and onlyOscarto date forBest Actress in a Leading Role.[15]Noted film criticRoger EbertrankedMonster1st on his list ofthe best films of 2003[16]and later in 2009, ranked it 3rd on the list of the best films of the decade.[17]For this film, Jenkins won theIndependent Spirit AwardforBest First Featureand the Franklin J. Schaffner Award of theAmerican Film Institute(an award for outstanding graduates of theAFI Conservatory),[4][18]and also was nominated for theEdgar Allan Poe AwardforBest Screenplay.
After the success ofMonster, Jenkins was approached by formerUnited States Air Forcetest pilotChuck Yeagerto develop a film about his life. When that project did not reach fruition, she attempted to make aRyan Goslingmovie titledI Am Superman, a film with no relation tothe DC Comics character, but development ended when she became pregnant. Jenkins spent the next decade working in television.[1]
In 2011, she directed one segment in the made-for-television anthology filmFive. Jenkins received an Emmy nomination because of her work on the film. Jenkins directed many commercials and TV shows, like episodes ofArrested DevelopmentandEntourage. She received an Emmy nomination again, for directing AMC'sThe Killingpilot. In October 2011, she was hired to directThor: The Dark World, the first sequel to 2011 superhero filmThor, but left the project after less than two months, due to creative differences.[19]In 2014, she was attached toSweetheart, a film about a female assassin,[20]but that film was never made.
In 2015, Jenkins signed on as director for theDC Extended UniversefilmWonder Woman,[21]with a screenplay byAllan Heinbergand a story co-written by Heinberg,Zack SnyderandJason Fuchs, and starringGal Gadot.[22]The film was released in June 2017, and gave Jenkins the biggest domestic opening for a female director, surpassing previous record holderFifty Shades of GreybySam Taylor-Johnson.[23]With this film, Jenkins also became the first female director of an American studio superhero film, and the third female director to direct a film with a budget over $100 million.[24][25]The film was acclaimed by both critics and audiences and grossed over $800 million worldwide, exceeding box office original predictions.Wonder Womaneventually became the highest-grossing film directed by a woman, surpassing previous record holderMamma Mia!byPhyllida Lloyd.[26]However, in 2019,Frozen IIdirected byJennifer Lee(withChris Buck) andCaptain Marvel, directed byAnna Boden(withRyan Fleck) became number one and two respectively, droppingWonder Womanand Jenkins to number three.[27]
While promotingWonder Woman, Jenkins mentioned that her next project would likely be a limited television series developed with her husband.[1]This project was later revealed as a horror series titledRiprore, to premiere on thevideo-on-demandserviceShudder.[28]In July 2017, the cable networkTNTannounced Jenkins would direct the premiere of a six-episode television drama,I Am the Night, written by her husband Sam Sheridan, and featuring herWonder WomanstarChris Pine. She additionally served as executive producer.[29]
In September 2017,Varietyreported Jenkins would return to directWonder Woman 2.However, on MTV's "Happy, Sad, Confused" podcast, Jenkins revealed that she considered walking away from the sequel due to salary dispute between her and Warner Bros.[30][31]On December 6, 2017, Jenkins was named byTimeas the seventh runner-up forTimePerson of the Year.[32]
Wonder Woman 1984was scheduled to be released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on June 5, 2020, but, due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, the release was delayed until December 25, 2020. It had originally been scheduled for November 1, 2019;[33]unlike the first film, the sequel received a mixed critical reception and was a box office failure. She has been negotiating the terms of her contract withWarner Brothersfor an estimated seven to nine million dollars, which would be a record breaking salary for a female filmmaker. She signed on to the first film with no guarantee of directing a second film, but envisioned the second one during the making ofWonder Woman, which turned out to benefit her greatly. When she had signed on to do the second film, she had the ability to get a much higher salary than she would have if she had been signed on to do both films from the beginning. Her goal with her negotiations were to make sure she would get the same salary that her male counterparts would be getting for doing this movie and she seems to have succeeded.[7]
In October 2020, it was revealed that Gal Gadot and Jenkins will be teaming up again for the filmCleopatra. The film will star Gadot as the titularCleopatra, the historical pharaoh of ancient Egypt, with Jenkins as the director.[34]In December 2021, Jenkins dropped out of the film, but remained as a producer, to instead focus on a thirdWonder Womanfilm and theStar Warsspin-off filmRogue Squadron.[35]
In November 2020, aspin off filmset in theWonder Womanuniverse focusing on the Amazons of Themyscira was confirmed to be in early development. Jenkins will not return to direct the film, but cowrote the script withGeoff Johns.[36]In 2021, Warner Bros. announced a third installment of theWonder Womanfranchise with Jenkins attached to write and direct.[37]However, in December 2022, it was reported byThe Hollywood Reporterthat Jenkins' third film would not be moving forward after all and was considered to be "dead in its current incarnation", as the film did not fit with the newly appointedDC Studiosheads' plans for the DC Extended Universe or its upcoming successor, theDC Universe.[38]
In December 2020, Disney announced that Jenkins was hired to directRogue Squadron, aStar Warsspin-off film inspired by the group of starfighter pilots of the same name.[39][40]The film was scheduled to be released on December 22, 2023.[39]Jenkins would be the first female director to helm aStar Warsfilm,[39]but not the first female director within the overall franchise. In June 2021,The Hollywood Reporterreported thatMatthew Robinsonhad been hired byLucasfilmto write the script.[41]In November 2021, it was reported that the film's production had been delayed due to scheduling conflicts with other projects Jenkins was developing.[42]In September 2022, Disney removedRogue Squadronfrom their release schedule.[43]The film was then shelved in March 2023.[44]In March 2024, Jenkins revealed that following the cancellation of the thirdWonder Womanfilm, she had returned toRogue Squadron, finalizing a deal with Lucasfilm prior to the2023 Writers Guild of America strike, and that she now "owes" a new draft of the script.[45]
Jenkins,Wonder Womanactresses Gal Gadot andLynda Carter,DC EntertainmentPresidentDiane Nelsonand U.N. Under-Secretary GeneralCristina Gallachappeared at theUnited Nationson October 21, 2016, the 75th anniversary of the first appearance of Wonder Woman, to mark the character's designation by the United Nations as its "Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls".[46][47]The gesture was intended to raise awareness of UN Sustainable Development Goal No. 5, which seeks to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls by 2030.[46][47][48]The decision was met with protests from UN staff members who stated in their petition to UN Secretary-GeneralBan Ki-moonthat the character is "not culturally encompassing or sensitive", and served to objectify women. As a result, the character was stripped of the designation, and the project ended December 16.[48]
In the filmMonster, Jenkins explored the issues of morality and femininity.[49]InWonder Woman, Jenkins suggests that the audience experiences the journey of the lead character Diana Prince through Diana's eyes. Diana is portrayed as the universal human character that the audience never experiences from the outside. Jenkins suggests that the major theme of the film is the idea that there are no other villains than humans themselves. She mentions how she was influenced bySupermanand how that is incorporated in her own superhero film.
Connie Nielsen(who playsHippolytain theWonder Womanfranchise) said that Jenkins fought for feminist themes to be included inWonder Woman, and rejected the idea of including a controversial origin story for the Amazons, which portrayed them as victims rather than warriors.[50]
Some of Jenkins' mentors and influencers includeGary Ross,Kathryn BigelowandSteve Perry. She mentions that she often likes to discuss the process of making soundtracks with musicians like Perry, who was a musical consultant on her filmMonster. The organization and structure of music, according to Jenkins, has a lot of parallels to theatre and drama. As a director, she uses this rhythm to direct the delivery of dialogues.
In 2007, Jenkins married Sam Sheridan, a former firefighter and the author of the bookA Fighter's Heart.[6]They have a son[3]and reside inSanta Monica, California.[1]

Geoff Johns was born January 25, 1973,[6]inDetroit, Michigan,[7][8]the son of Barbara and Fred Johns.[9]He is of half-Lebaneseancestry[10]and grew up in the suburbs ofGrosse PointeandClarkston.[7][11]As a child, Johns and his brother first discovered comics through an old box of comics they found in their grandmother's attic, which included copies ofThe Flash,Superman,Green Lantern, andBatmanfrom the 1960s and 1970s. He has named the Flash as his favorite character, stating that he owns every issue of it.[7]
Johns eventually began to patronize a comics shop inTraverse City, recalling that the first new comics he bought wereCrisis on Infinite Earths#3 or 4 andThe Flash#348 or 349, as the latter was his favorite character. As Johns continued collecting comics, he gravitated toward DC Comics and laterVertigo, and drew comics.[7]After graduating fromClarkston High Schoolin 1991,[9]he studied media arts, screenwriting, film production and film theory atMichigan State University.[8]He graduated from Michigan State in 1995,[12]and then moved to Los Angeles, California.[7][9]
In Los Angeles, Johns cold-called the office of directorRichard Donnerlooking for an internship, and while Johns was being transferred to various people, Donner picked up the phone by accident, leading to a conversation and the internship. Johns started off copying scripts, and after about two months, was hired as a production assistant for Donner, whom Johns regards as his mentor.[7][13]
While working on the production of Donner's 1997 filmConspiracy Theory, Johns visited New York City, where he met DC Comics personnel such asEddie Berganza, reigniting his childhood interest in comics.[7]
Berganza invited Johns to tour the DC Comics offices, and offered Johns the opportunity to suggest ideas, which led to Johns pitchingStars and S.T.R.I.P.E., a series based on the secondStar-Spangled Kidand her stepfather,[14]to editor Chuck Kim a year later. Johns expected to write comics "on the side", until he metDavid GoyerandJames Robinson, who were working onJSA. After looking atStars and S.T.R.I.P.E., Robinson offered Johns co-writing duties onJSAin 2000,[15]and Johns credits both him andMike Carlinwith shepherding him into the comics industry. He also credits reading James Robinson'sThe Golden Ageas the book responsible for his love of the characters featured in the book, and for his decision to accept writing duties onJSA.[7]
That same year, Johns became the regular writer onThe Flashongoing series with issue 164. Johns' work onThe Flashrepresents one example of his modeling of various elements in his stories after aspects of his birth town, explaining, "When I wroteThe Flash, I turned Keystone City into Detroit, made it a car town. I make a lot of my characters from Detroit. I think self-made, blue-collar heroes represent Detroit. Wally West's Flash was like that. I took the inspiration of the city and the people there and used it in the books."[11]Johns'Flashrun concluded with #225.[16]
He co-wrote aBeast Boylimited series withBen Raabin 2000[17]and crafted the "Return to Krypton" story arc in the Superman titles withPasqual Ferryin 2002.[18]After writingThe Avengersvol. 3 #57–76 (Oct. 2002–Feb. 2004) andAvengers Icons:The Vision#1–4 (Oct. 2002–Jan. 2003) forMarvel Comics,[19]Johns oversaw the re-launch ofHawkmanandTeen Titans.[20]

Gal Gadot was born on 30 April 1985[2]inPetah Tikva,[note 1]where she initially lived.[9]She was born to Jewish parents ofAshkenazidescent;[7]her mother's roots areCzechandPolish, while  her father's areAustrian,Russian, andGerman.[10]Her parents, Michael, an engineer, and Irit, a physical education teacher,[11][12]hebraized their surnamefrom "Greenstein" to "Gadot" before her birth.[13]In Hebrew, her first name means "wave," and her surname translates to "riverbanks."[6]She has a younger sister, Dana.[14]
Her father is a sixth-generationSabra,[15]and one of his ancestors was the firstchemistatShaare Zedek Hospitalin Jerusalem,[16]while her mother is a first-generation Sabra and the daughter ofHolocaust survivors.[14][5]Her maternal grandfather,[5]Abraham Weiss,[17]was born as Adolf Weiss,[18]in the village ofMunkács,[19]Czechoslovakiain 1928. At 13, whenNazi Germany invaded, his father died in the army. He, his mother, and his brother were sent toAuschwitz, where the latter two perished in thegas chamber. He was the sole survivor of his family. Her maternal grandmother, however, managed to escape Europe beforeWorld War II.[20][15][17]Abraham immigrated alone toJaffa, where he built a family and "a successful business". He later served in theGolani Brigade, and in his later years, he joinedIsrael Defense Forces(IDF) expeditions to share his firsthandHolocaust testimony.[21]
Gadot grew up in the Givat Tal neighborhood ofRosh HaAyin,[8][22][23][15]in what she described as a "very Jewish, Israeli family environment".[14]At 11, she visitedHolocaust memorial sitesin Poland to learn about Auschwitz andMajdanek. Reflecting on the experience, she recalled: "I, an entitled child, felt the suffering theMuselmannexperienced back then."[23]Encouraged by her mother to be active from a young age, Gadot took up swimming at four and later played tennis.[15]She joined the local volleyball and basketball teams,[24]soccer-teamcheerleader,[19]and trained in ballet, hip-hop, and jazz for 12 years, at one point considering a career as a choreographer.[14]
As a child, she struggled with a weak voice and attendedspeech therapy, where she learned properbreathing techniques.[25]At 12, she was invited to enter theGirl of the Year[he](Hebrew:נערת השנה‎) competition but declined, saying, "Ugh, modeling? I'm much smarter and deeper. I won't make a living from posing for the camera." However, reflecting on that decision later, she acknowledged, "when I grew up, I realized that it's a job and that it's also fun—you make great money, meet fascinating people, and visit interesting places."[24]
Although Gadot’s native language isHebrew, she started taking English lessons inthird gradeand became fluent when she decided she wanted to watchSeinfeldandFriends.[26]She later attended Begin High School, where she majored in biology.[23]After graduating, she had a few months before beginning her mandatory two-year service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). During this time, she received modeling offers but instead chose to work atBurger King, saying, "I was like, posing for money? Ugh, it’s not for me." Meanwhile, her mother and a friend submitted an application on her behalf for the Miss Israel pageant.[15]Before enlisting, she also worked as acaregiverfor eight-month-old twins.[23]
"It wasn't my love for fashion or glamour that led me there. My enlistment [in the army] had been postponed by six months, and all my friends were already in uniform. My mother suggested I try out, so I went through the selection process, met wonderful girls, and thought, 'Why not? It will be fun, and I'll get one last trip abroad before the army.' I figured it would make for a good story to tell my future grandchildren."
In 2004, the 54thMiss Israelbeauty pageant took place at theHaifaCongress Center,[27]where an 18-year-old Gal Gadot participated with little expectation of winning.

My job is to take pictures in a bathing suit. There’s nothing provocative about that."[42]After the issue was released in July 2007,[42]the shoot significantly boosted her public profile,[43][44]and as a result, she landed an international campaign for "Prada Ellis" perfume.[31]

Isabel Feinstein ofThe Jerusalem Postpraised Gadot as a powerful example of "soft power" for Israel, highlighting how her rise to global fame offers the "Jewish state" a unique opportunity for positive international exposure. Feinstein highlighted that Gadot's Google search results (20.7 million) surpass those of Israel's prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu(16.1 million), emphasizing her global influence.[166]She also noted that Gadot's appearances on Western talk shows likeJimmy Fallonand TheEllen Showhave helped humanize the stereotype of the "brutal Israeli soldier," making her relatable to a worldwide audience. Feinstein went on to describe Gadot as "a living contradiction", claiming that "the association of an Israeli actress with a progressive agenda helps those who unfairly condemn all citizens of a nation for the actions of their government see that Israelis are complex and open-minded humans with a wide range of opinions".[166]In a 2019 article byThe Australian Jewish News, it is highlighted that Gadot is often seen as a more effective ambassador for Israel than its diplomats, given her global fame. Ari Ingel of theCreative Community for Peacebelieves her interactions with prominent Hollywood figures can positively influence Israel's image. However, Shayna Weiss ofBrandeis Universityviews this as a "soft power" issue—using culture to sway opinions—and questions whether such influence has measurable or lasting effects, saying, "I don’t think Gal Gadot harms Israel, but do I think Gal Gadot helps Israel much? Not so sure."[167]
The release of the film sparked a debate about Gadot'sJewish identityand her portrayal as awoman of color.[168]Some argued that as anIsraeli Jew, Gadot should be seen through the lens of racial complexity, in the claims that Hollywood has historically limited representation of diverse identities.[169]Critics argued Wonder Woman was a breakthrough forwhite womenbut lacked representation for women of color.[170]In contrast, others viewed Gadot's role as a positive step toward broader representation, especially for Jewish women, Israeli heritage, distinct accent, and strength as a heroic figure.[168]Tamar Hermannreflected on Gadot's portrayal, noting that Jewish women are often underrepresented or stereotyped in Hollywood. For many, Gadot's role offered a rare and empowering representation of Jewish women, highlighting her Israeli heritage, distinct accent, and strength as a heroic figure.[171]Some argued that Black women's support for the film ignored Gadot's ties to theIDFand her stance onPalestinian oppressionwarning it could complicate issues ofWhite feminism,anti-Black racism, andracial capitalism, calling for a more nuanced view of the film'scultural significance.[172]
During his visit to Los Angeles for the General Assembly of theJewish Federations, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin was invited by Gadot to the premiere ofJustice League, a film in which she stars. Rivlin embraced Gadot, expressing his pride in her as a "true ambassador" of Israel, "who has managed to place us [Israeli] at the pinnacles of global filmmaking with grace, values, and an Israeli smile."[174]

He praised Gadot, calling her "a good ambassador for Israel". Caspi noted that although Gadot did not wear ahostages pinat the event, she remains an important figure for Israel in Hollywood.[178]In March 2025, theADLawarded Gadot a "Certificate of Appreciation" for her strong stance against anti-Semitism and hatred, and her unwavering support for Israel and Jewish communities worldwide.[179]
Gadot identifies as a feminist and promotes women's empowerment.[180]In July 2016, Gadot joined a campaign by Israeli female master’s students in communications to rebrand Israel by highlighting its strong women. The campaign aims to promote women's strength, opportunities, and influence in Israel. The campaign, titled "Israel Creates Wonder Women," showcases "real-life Israeli heroines," including an air force pilot, a doctor, and a businesswoman. Gadot, supported the initiative after the students reached out.[181]

Under-Secretary-GeneralCristina Gallachappeared at theUnited Nationson 21 October 2016, the 75th anniversary of the first appearance of Wonder Woman, to mark the character's designation by the United Nations as its "Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls".[182][183]The gesture was intended to raise awareness of UNSustainable Development GoalNo. 5, which seeks to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls by 2030.[182][183][184]The decision was met with protests from UN staff members who stated in their petition to UN Secretary-GeneralBan Ki-moonthat the character is "not culturally encompassing or sensitive" and served to objectify women. As a result, the character was stripped of the designation, and the project ended on 16 December.[184]
In a January 2018, interview withWomen's Wear Daily, she highlighted Hollywood's ongoing cultural shift towardsgender equality, calling it necessary and overdue.[180]That same year, she attended theGolden Globes, where she joined fellow actors in wearing black to support theTime's Up movement.Reflecting on the event, Gadot shared, "It was incredibly impactful, and just being part of it felt so powerful and inspiring."[185]In July 2018, Gadot surprised children at Inova Children's Hospital inAnnandale, Virginia, by visiting them dressed as Wonder Woman.[186]In May 2019, Gadot joined a "Reach Out Association" initiative to support 25 ill children on a special trip to Los Angeles.

In April 2023, Gadot hosted a special Holocaust Remembrance Day event at her Hollywood home, where she welcomed Holocaust survivors like Celina Biniaz, the youngest survivor ofSchindler's List, along with notable Hollywood guests. The event was part of the "Zikaron BaSalon" tradition, which translates to "living room memories" and involves survivors sharing their testimonies in intimate settings. Gadot reflected on the event, saying, "I don’t know about God, but I believe in people, in the power of one’s decision to do good."[188][189]In May, she surprised children from the "Lend a Hand" organization during a visit toUniversal Studiosin Los Angeles.[190]
Gadot also a strong supporter of theIsraeli militaryand considers it her duty as a public figure to advocate for Israel.[191]During the2014 Gaza War,[192]Gadot posted on Facebook a picture of herself and her daughter praying in front ofShabbat candlesin support of the IDF. She expressed her prayers for Israeli citizens and soldiers and condemnedHamas, whom she called "cowards" hiding behind women and children.[193]The post sparked both support and criticism due to differing views on the conflict.[194]
In 2019, Gadot clashed with Israeli Prime MinisterNetanyahuover the status of Israel's Arab minority. After Netanyahu's remark that Israel is a "nation-state" for Jews only, actressRotem Selacriticized it, calling for equality for all. Gadot, defending Sela, emphasized, It's about "peace, equality, and tolerance." Her comments sparked mixed reactions, with some praising her stance and others urging a clearer political position.[195]
During the2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, Gadot called for peace in a statement that sparked widespread backlash. While expressing support for Israel, she referred to Palestinians as "neighbors" rather than naming them directly, which many saw as downplaying their suffering.[196][197][198]Yair Netanyahu, son of the Israeli prime minister, criticized her neutrality, arguing that, as Israel’s most known figure, she should have taken a stronger stance. He compared her toBellaandGigi Hadid, who are vocal in theirpro-Palestiniansupport, saying Gadot acted "as if she was from Switzerland" instead of strongly supporting Israel.[199]Israeli nationalistsalso expressed disappointment, believing she should have used her global influence to defend Israel more strongly.[199]
In 2022, following theBnei BrakandTel Aviv shootingattacks, Gadot remained silent, which led to criticism from her Israeli fans.[200]However, her mother, Irit Gadot, addressed the matter publicly, defending her daughter. In response to the backlash, Gadot remained silent on her own social media but later responded to her mother’s post with a message: "My mother, you are a kind-hearted angel. Only love brings love".[201]
In August 2022, Gadot visited the town ofNetiv HaAsarainsouthern Israel, the closest town toGazaand a front-line location duringclashes between the Israeli militaryand Gaza.

In October 2023, during theIsrael–Hamas war, Gadot posted astoryon herInstagramstating, "Killing innocent Palestinians is horrific," alongside condemning the killing of Israelis. This led to criticism from some in Israel,[204]particularly from rapperYoav Eliasi, who called her a "repulsive woman" for equating the killing of Israelis with that of Palestinians, accusing her of not understanding the gravity of the situation or the nature of the violence Israel was facing.[205]This followed by Israeli journalistOfira Assayag, who accused Gadot of being out of touch and living in a "Hollywood bubble."[204]Assayag questioned Gadot's loyalty to Israel, calling her a "disconnected piece of shit," and compared her to other celebrities likeDwayne JohnsonandGigi Hadid, who showed more balanced support for both sides. Gadot later added, "Killing innocent Israelis is horrific. If you don't think the same, I think you need to ask yourself why," but deleted the reference to Palestinians after further backlash.[204]
Later that month, Gadot, along with over 700Hollywoodprofessionals, signed an open letter condemning thePalestinian militantgroupHamas, demanding the release ofhostages, and expressing support for Israel.[206]In November 2023, Gadot continued her advocacy by organizing a screening ofBearing Witness, an Israeli film showing the violence of Hamas, though she did not attend the screening.[207]Reports stated that 120 people were invited to the event. The Jewish organizationJewish Voice for Peacecriticized Gadot andGuy Nativfor screening the film, calling it a "propaganda," claiming the film overlooked the situation in Palestine and served those promoting war and genocide.[208]
In May 2024, Gadot advocated forEden Golan, Israel'sEurovision representative, publicly encouraging her followers to vote for Golan. As a result, Gadot lost one million Instagram followers. Despite the backlash, Gadot continued to share posts praising Golan and urging votes throughout the competition.[209]Later In September 2024, Gadot joined Israeli PresidentIsaac Herzogin launching the "Voice of the People" initiative, aimed at fostering global Jewish unity amidst risingantisemitismand the "ongoing hostage crisis."[210][211]
When I look back 15 years, when I was starting out, being Israeli was something that people admired and were excited about—Israeli women, their strength, and all that. I’m not saying it’s no longer the case, but now it’s complicated. The conversation has changed. It’s different. And I find myself, time and again, having to engage in very complex and often uncomfortable discussions with people who have opinions about what’s happening, trying to give them the full picture of what’s really going on.
In January 2025, Gadot participated inNoa Tishby’s "#BringOnTheLight" campaign, celebrating Jewish resilience and joy duringHanukkah. The campaign featured other celebrities who lit the menorah on different nights.[213]Late that month, she faced backlash after attending the 2025 Golden Globes without wearing a yellow ribbon pin, a symbol of support forhostages held by Hamas. Reports then circulated claiming she was forbidden from wearing the pin. In response, Gadot clarified that she was never told not to wear it. Instead, Gadot wore a yellow ring and posted on social media to raise awareness for the hostages' plight.[214]She faced backlash over this, including from Ofira Asayag, who called Gadot a "hypocrite."[215]
In February 2025, Gadot spoke about the hostages and the Israel-Gaza war, stating on her Harper's Bazaar Spain interview that her wish is for a "diplomatic agreement that allows all parties at the table to live a good and prosperous life."[216]
She reinforced her anti-war stance, saying that "I know it sounds cliché, but just as they are teaching us to hate, by increasing antisemitism, we can also teach them to love. I want to believe that love is the force that moves the world. War is a defeat for everyone. Hate is horrible. It is toxic for the outside world and for the hater."[217]
In March 2020, Gadot and a number of other celebrities, including herWonder Woman 1984co-starKristen Wiig, performedan online versionof the song "Imagine" byJohn Lennon, intended to raise morale during theCOVID-19 pandemic.[218]The video received backlash with critics dismissing it as an ineffective response to the pandemic; Jon Caramanica ofThe New York Timescalled it "an empty and profoundly awkward gesture".[219][220][221][222][223]Gadot later acknowledged the video did not garner the positive reaction that had been intended, but was unapologetic in explaining the thinking behind it.[83]In a 2022 interview withInStylemagazine, Gadot admitted that the video was done in "poor taste", but still maintained that it had "pure intentions".[224]

There's never a moment when I'm sure they will."[243]She shared advice she once received from directorFrancis Ford Coppola: "He said to me, 'You know what? I'm always full of doubts too and I'm sure people won't like my work. So I just follow my heart and stay humble".[243]

Gadot has expressed admiration forPenélope Cruz, particularly for her courage, individuality, and confidence in embracing her identity. She appreciates how Cruz "stands up for herself and has something to say—she has her own spice, which I love. She is very courageous and also has an accent, but she just goes with it."[36]She also recognizesYafa Yarkonias her "Israeli culturalhero", referring to her as "the singer of wars".[23]Additionally, when asked whichhistorical eventshe would like to witness, Gadot shared that she would have chosen the rally after whichYitzhak Rabinwas assassinated, as it symbolized "the extreme rejection of democracy".[23]

She's a funny, pretty woman, but she's also a comedian, and she's wonderfully confident about playing not nice ... Ms. Wiig, a longtime cast member ofSaturday Night Live, and Ms. Mumolo, a veteran of the Los Angeles comedy troupe the Groundlings, know what female moviegoers want: honest laughs with, and not solely about, women".[29]For her work in the film, Wiig was nominated for theGolden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musicaland theAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

Critics asserted that Wiig's "vibrant performance is almost worth the price of admission—and it has to be, becauseHateship Loveshipdoesn't have much else going for it", as part of a mixed overall response.[39]In 2014, she also reprised her role inHow to Train Your Dragon 2, and starred withBill HaderinCraig Johnson's dramedyThe Skeleton Twins, as estranged twins reuniting with the possibility of mending their relationship.The Skeleton Twinswas an arthouse success,[40]with theGlobe and Mailremarking: "Johnson's unfussy direction serves as a fine showcase for the twoSNLveterans to demonstrate how their comic shorthand plays equally well in a slightly darker register".[41]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
