I'm Thinking of Ending Things(stylized asi'm thinkingofending things) is a 2020 Americansurrealistpsychological thriller[1]film written and directed byCharlie Kaufman. It is an adaptation of the2016 novel of the same namebyIain Reid. The plot follows a young woman (Jessie Buckley) who goes on a trip with her boyfriend (Jesse Plemons) to meet his parents (Toni ColletteandDavid Thewlis). Throughout the film, the main narrative is intercut with footage of a school janitor (Guy Boyd) going to work, with both stories intersecting by thethird act.
I'm Thinking of Ending Thingswas released in select theaters on August 28, 2020, and onNetflixon September 4, 2020. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the two lead performances and the cinematography.
Throughout the film, the main narrative is intercut with footage of an elderly janitor working at a high school, including scenes in which he sees students rehearsingOklahoma!and watches a romantic comedy film.
A young woman (whose occupation and name change throughout) contemplates ending her relationship with her boyfriend Jake while on a trip to meet his parents at their farm. During the drive, Jake attempts to recite a poem he read when he was younger, "Ode: Intimations of Immortality", and asks her to recite an original poem of hers to pass time. After she recites a morbid poem about coming home,[a]they arrive at the farmhouse. Jake takes her to the barn, where he recounts a story about the farm's pigs being eaten alive by maggots.
Upon entering the farmhouse, the woman notices scratches on the basement door. At dinner, she shows Jake's parents photographs of her landscape paintings and says she met Jake at a trivia night in a bar, with narrative inconsistencies. Later, she notices a childhood picture of Jake, but becomes confused after initially recognizing the child as herself. She receives a call from a friend with a female name, and a mysterious male voice explains that there is "one question to answer". Over the course of the night, Jake's parents transform into their younger and older selves, though nobody comments on this. When the woman takes a nightgown down to the basement to wash, she discovers several janitor uniforms in the washing machine and finds posters forRalph Albert Blakelockexhibitions that have images of paintings seemingly identical to her own. She receives another call from the same mysterious voice.
On the drive home, Jake refers to several events that evening which the woman does not remember and then claims she drank a lot of wine. Word association leads to an extended critical discussion ofJohn Cassavetes'A Woman Under the Influence.[b]The couple stops at Tulsey Town, a drive-through ice cream stand, whose employees are students at the janitor's school. When the woman is leaving, an employee with a rash says they are scared for her.
Jake stops at his high school to throw the ice-cream cups away. After a heated argument in the parking lot about the lyrics of "Baby, It's Cold Outside", they share a kiss. Jake has a flashback of the janitor watching them from inside the school and decides to confront him, leaving the woman alone in the car. Eventually, she decides to look for Jake inside the school. She meets the janitor and asks him where Jake is, but she cannot remember what Jake looks like. She tells the janitor that nothing happened between Jake and her on the night they met, instead claiming Jake made her uncomfortable by staring at her.
The woman discovers Jake at the end of a hall. They watch as people dressed like themselves and the janitor engage inballet,[c]which ends when the janitor's dancer kills Jake's dancer with a knife.
Having finished his shift, the janitor enters his car, but does not start the motor. He experiences hallucinations of Jake's parents arguing and animated Tulsey Town commercials. The janitor then undresses and reenters the school, led by the hallucination of a maggot-infested pig who tells him that "someone has to be the pig infested with maggots", that "everything is the same, when you look close enough", and that he should get dressed.
On anauditoriumstage, an old Jake receives aNobel Prize[d]and sings "Lonely Room"[3]fromOklahoma!to an audience of people from his life, all of them in theatrical old-age makeup, who give him a standing ovation. The emotional Jake stands there to gaze upon the audience for an uncomfortably long time as the scene fades into solid blue.
In the final scene, the solid blue fades into a shot of the school parking lot the next morning, where the couple's car is absent, while the janitor's truck is still parked and now covered in snow.[4]Towards the end of the credits, scraping sounds emanate from the engine of an approaching snowplow.
It was announced in January 2018 thatCharlie Kaufmanwas adaptingIain Reid's novelI'm Thinking of Ending ThingsforNetflix, as well as directing.[8]In December,Brie LarsonandJesse Plemonswere cast in the film.[9][10]In March 2019,Jessie Buckley,Toni ColletteandDavid Thewlisjoined the cast, with Buckley replacing Larson.[11]
Principal photographybegan on March 13, 2019, inFishkill, New York,[12]and was completed on April 29. As of November 7, the film was inpost-production.[13][14]
I'm Thinking of Ending Thingswas released in select theaters on August 28, 2020,[15]and onNetflixon September 4.[16]
Review aggregatorRotten Tomatoesreports that 82% of 262 critic reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10; the critics' consensus for the film reads: "Aided by stellar performances from Jessie Buckley and Jesse Plemons,I'm Thinking of Ending Thingsfinds writer-director Charlie Kaufman grappling with the human condition as only he can."[17]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted averagescore of 78 out of 100 based on reviews from 46 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[18]
Karen Han ofPolygonwrote: "The lack of clear answers and structure can be frustrating, but the strange way the story is told enhances just how real the exchanges between characters feel. The frustration that Lucy feels with Jake, that Jake feels with his mother, that his parents feel for each other, are all uncomfortably tangible, especially as tensions rise. The film's 134-minute runtime is a long time to sit with that feeling, but Kaufman's big divergence from the novel he's adapting is in lending its ending a more buoyant note."[19]In his review, Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comgave the film 31⁄2out of 4 stars, calling it "a movie that is undeniably complex in terms of symbolism and a more surreal final act than most people will be expecting". He also praised the cinematography, saying that the film's atmosphere is "amplified by a tight 4:3 aspect ratio courtesy ofŁukasz Żal(Cold War) that forces the viewer to pay more attention to what's in frame."[20]The Observer's Wendy Ide wrote: "This is not cinema that leaves you feeling good about things. Nor does it tread a familiar path. ButI'm Thinking of Ending Thingsis one of the most daringly unexpected films of the year, a sinewy, unsettling psychological horror, saturated with a squirming dream logic that tips over into the domain of nightmares."[21]
In a more mixed review, Adam Graham ofThe Detroit Newsgave the film a C, calling Plemons's and Buckley's performances excellent, but lamenting the plot, writing: "I'm Thinking of Ending Thingsis an unsolvable riddle where the only answer is mankind's hopelessness, and we've been down this road before."[22]ForTIME,Stephanie Zacharekwrote: "For every moment of raw, affecting insight there are zillions of milliseconds of Kaufman's proving what a tortured smartie he is.I'm Thinking of Ending Thingsmust have been arduous to make, and it's excruciatingly tedious to watch."[23]

Charles Stuart Kaufman(/ˈkɔːfmən/; born November 19, 1958) is an American screenwriter, film director, and novelist. Having first come to prominence for writingBeing John Malkovich(1999),Adaptation(2002), andEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind(2004), he went on to direct films based on his own screenplays:Synecdoche, New York(2008),Anomalisa(2015), andI'm Thinking of Ending Things(2020). In 2020, he released a novel,Antkind.
One of the most celebrated screenwriters of his era,[1][2][3][4]Kaufman has received anAcademy Award, threeBAFTA Awards, twoIndependent Spirit Awards, and aWriters Guild of America Award. Film criticRoger EbertcalledSynecdoche, New York"the best movie of the decade" in 2009.[5]Three of Kaufman's scripts appear in theWriters Guild of America's list of the 101 greatest movie screenplays ever written.[6]
Kaufman was born in New York City to aJewishfamily[7][8][9][10]on November 19, 1958, the son of Helen and Myron Kaufman.[11]He grew up inMassapequa, New York, before moving toWest Hartford, Connecticut.[12]In high school, Kaufman was in the drama club, performing in numerous productions before landing the lead role in a production ofPlay It Again, Samduring his senior year.[12]After high school graduation, Kaufman attendedBoston Universitybefore transferring toNew York University, where he studied film. While attending NYU, Kaufman met Paul Proch, with whom he wrote many unproduced scripts and plays.[12]
Between 1983 and 1984, Kaufman and Proch wrote comedic articles and spoofs forNational Lampoon. His work included parodies ofKurt Vonnegutand theX-Men.[13]Kaufman and Proch tried to get their screenplays produced, sending them to many people in the film industry. The only response the two ever received was a supportive letter fromAlan Arkinabout their screenplayPurely Coincidental.[14]In hope of finding atalent agent, he wrote a portfolio ofspec scriptsbased on television series such asMarried... with Children,Newhart,It's Garry Shandling's ShowandThe Simpsons. While pursuing his writing career, he began working odd jobs incustomer serviceto support himself and his wife, Denise.[15]During the late 1980s, Kaufman lived and worked inMinneapolis, working at theStar Tribunecirculation department for four and a half years, as well as theMinneapolis Institute of Art.[12]
In 1991, one of Kaufman's spec scripts finally got attention, and he gained a talent agent. The agent suggested Kaufman move fromMinneapolistoLos Angelesin search of more job prospects. He moved to Los Angeles alone for two months, interviewing for a variety of different television writing jobs. The only offer he got was aComedy Centralseries titledAccess America, hosted by actorFred Willard, which coincidentally was being filmed in Minneapolis. Kaufman was prepared to accept the job and move back to Minneapolis until he was offered a job byDavid Mirkin, writing for the second season of his andChris Elliott's sitcomGet a Life, starring Elliott.[12]He wrote two episodes ofGet a Lifebefore its cancellation in 1992. At first, Kaufman found the experience of working on a writing staff nerve-wracking and did not speak in the writer's room for the first few weeks. After his work was well received by other members of the staff, Kaufman overcame his timidity and became more amenable to showing others his work.[15]
AfterGet a Life's cancellation, Kaufman tried to get work on series such asSeinfeld,The Larry Sanders Show,The SimpsonsandMr. Show, but was not hired by any of them. He continued to work on other comedic series: Fox's sketch comedy showThe Edge,The Trouble with LarryandNed and Stacey, the last of which he also produced. The most notable series he worked on in this period wasThe Dana Carvey Show, which featured writers and performers such asLouis C.K.,Robert Smigel,Greg Daniels,Stephen ColbertandSteve Carell. On all these series, Kaufman struggled to keep his material from being adulterated or not produced at all, because of his unconventional writing and his quiet nature.[15]
Kaufman also wrote somepilotscripts of his own, but none of them was produced.[12][16]These included two pilots forDisney,Depressed RoomiesandRambling Pants(the former a surrealist take on the "buddy sitcom" and the latter focused on the adventures of a time-travelling poet named Pants) and a pilot forHBO,In Limbo, a naturalistic look at a romantic relationship devoid of the usual tropes ofromantic films.[15]BeforeBeing John Malkovichwas released, he was hired to pitch and write scripts for film projects that were never produced. These unproduced projects included a script for an adaptation ofPhilip K. Dick's novelA Scanner Darkly, a pitch for astar vehicleforDon RicklesandRodney Dangerfieldin which they would play a washed-up, murderouscomedy duo(an idea Kaufman used inAntkind), and a pitch for aR-ratedversion of the TV seriesGilligan's Island.
Kaufman first came to mainstream notice as the writer ofBeing John Malkovich, directed bySpike Jonze, earning anAcademy Awardnomination for his effort and winning aBAFTA. He wrote the script on spec in 1994, sending it to many companies and studios, all of which turned it down. The script eventually reachedFrancis Ford Coppola, who passed it on to his then-son-in-law Jonze, who agreed to direct the film.[17]
After the success ofBeing John Malkovich, another of Kaufman's screenplays was produced:Human Nature, which was directed byMichel Gondryand produced by Kaufman and Jonze. Kaufman and Jonze reunited yet again as the screenwriter and director ofAdaptation, which earned him another Academy Award nomination and his second BAFTA.Adaptationfeatured a fictionalized version of Kaufman and his fictional brother, Donald, who is credited as writer of the film along with Kaufman. The idea came to Kaufman while attempting to adaptSusan Orlean's bookThe Orchid Thiefinto film. Struggling withwriter's block, Kaufman turned the script into an exaggerated account of his struggles with adapting the screenplay.[18]
Kaufman wrote the screenplay forConfessions of a Dangerous Mind, a biopic based on the "unauthorized autobiography" ofChuck Barris, the creator of such popular game shows asThe Dating Gameand host ofThe Gong Show. The film focuses on Barris's claim to have been aCIAhit man. It wasGeorge Clooney's directorial debut. Kaufman criticized Clooney for making drastic alterations to the script without consulting him (instead, Clooney consulted Barris). Kaufman said in an interview with William Arnold: "The usual thing for a writer is to deliver a script and then disappear. That's not for me. I want to be involved from beginning to end. And these directors [Gondry and Jonze] know that, and respect it."[19]
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, released in 2004, was Kaufman's second pairing with directorMichel Gondry. Kaufman won his firstAcademy AwardforBest Original Screenplayand third BAFTA for the film together with Gondry and French artistPierre Bismuth. The trio also received the prestigiousPEN American Center2005 prize for screenplay for the film.[20]David Edelsteindescribed the film inSlateas "The Awful Truthturned inside-out byPhilip K. Dick, with nods toSamuel Beckett,Chris Marker,John Guare—the greatest dramatists of our modern fractured consciousness. But the weave is pure Kaufman."[21]
After agreeing to participate inCarter Burwell'sTheater of the New Ear, a double bill "sound play", Kaufman wrote and directed the audio playHope Leaves the Theater, while the other play in the production,Sawbones, was written and directed by theCoen Brothers.Hope Leaves the Theaterfollows a middle-aged woman, dissatisfied with her life and relationships, watching a play-within-the-play, and featured performances byHope Davis,Peter DinklageandMeryl Streep.[22]Theater of the New Eardebuted in April 2005 atSt. Ann's WarehouseinBrooklyn, New York.[23]Due to scheduling conflicts, later productions ofTheater of the New Eardid not feature the Coens' play, replacing it withAnomalisa, which Kaufman wrote under the pseudonym "'Francis Fregoli".Anomalisacenters on a man (David Thewlis) who perceives everyone in the world to be the same person (Tom Noonan) until he meets an exception (Jennifer Jason Leigh).[24]
Kaufman made his directorial film debut with thepostmodernfilmSynecdoche, New York, starring an ensemble cast led byPhilip Seymour Hoffman.[25]It premiered at theCannes Film Festivalin 2008. The idea for the film came when Kaufman and Spike Jonze were approached to direct ahorror film. Rather than make a conventional horror film, the two agreed to have the film deal with things they found frightening, such as mortality and life's brevity.[26]Kaufman decided to direct the film after Jonze left the project to directWhere the Wild Things Areinstead. The film premiered at the2008 Cannes Film Festivalwhere it split critics, with some calling it the best film of the year and others finding it pretentious.[27][28]In the years since its release, it has appeared on multiple lists ranking the best films of the 21st century.[29][30]The film's poor box office resulted in Kaufman finding it difficult to gain funding for scripts to which he has attached himself as director.[31]
Kaufman was slated to write and direct a film with the working titleFrank or Francis. Few details have been confirmed about the plot, except that it is amusical comedyaboutinternet anger cultureand was set to starJack Black, Nicolas Cage, Steve Carell,Kevin Kline, Catherine Keener,Paul Reubens,Jacki WeaverandElizabeth Banks.[32]In July 2012, Black said that funding for the project had fallen through, as the studio was unsure about its chances for success after the financial failure ofSynecdoche, New York. Although the future of the project is not certain, Kaufman says "It could still happen. It would have to be reinvented, though. We had a whole cast and we were headed into pre-production. So, I'd have to get people back and who knows if they would be interested anymore. But at this point, we don't have any money, so that's a secondary concern."[31]
Trying to make a return to television when the funding forFrank or Francisfell through, Kaufman sold a series to HBO in the May 2012 with Catherine Keener attached to star, but the series did not get past the scripting stage.[33]Kaufman also directed and wrote a pilot forFXtitledHow and Whyin 2014. The plot was described as being about a "man (played byJohn Hawkes) who can explain how and why a nuclear reactor works but is clueless about life". Along with Hawkes, the pilot co-starredMichael Cera,Sally Hawkins, Catherine Keener andTom Noonan. FX decided to not pick up the pilot.[34]
While struggling to get his directorial work made, Kaufman continued to work as a writer for hire, writing numerous unproduced screenplays. These included a satire set on a planet inhabited by everyone who ever lived, to be directed by Spike Jonze; an adaptation ofGeorge Saunders's bookCivilWarLand in Bad Decline, to be directed byBen Stiller; and an adaptation ofArthur Herzog's novelIQ 83, starring Steve Carell.[35][36]He later attempted to develop hisIQ 83screenplay into a limited series forHBO, to no avail.[37]He also did uncredited rewrites on films such asKung Fu Panda 2andAd Astra.[35]In April 2012, Kaufman was hired to adaptPatrick Ness'sChaos Walkingbook series, of which he wrote the first draft before leaving the project. After multiple rewrites by other writers, thefilmwas released in 2021 with Kaufman uncredited.[38]
Dino Stamatopoulos, a former colleague of Kaufman's fromThe Dana Carvey Show, became interested in adapting Kaufman'sAnomalisaplay script into astop motionanimatedfilm. With Kaufman's permission, Stamatopoulos turned to thecrowd-fundingwebsiteKickstarterto fund the film. The Kickstarter page was set up in August 2012 and by the time funding had ended $406,237 was pledged.[39]The rest of the $8 million budget was funded by the film's production company, Starburns Industries.[40]Kaufman co-directed the film withDuke Johnson, who had previous experience in stop motion filmmaking, and the original cast of the play production returned to reprise their roles. It had its world premiere at theTelluride Film Festivalon September 4, 2015,[41]receiving universal acclaim from critics.[42]The film went on to win theGrand Jury Prizeat theVenice Film Festivaland was nominated for anAcademy AwardforBest Animated Feature, but likeSynecdoche, it did poorly at the box office.[43]
Kaufman'sdebut novel,Antkind, was released in July 2020. Kaufman said in 2016 that the novel was being written so as to be unfilmable, and is itself about "animpossible movie".[44]InAntkind,film critic B. Rosenberg attempts to recall a three-month long stop-motion animation film that perished in a fire. Believing the film to be his last chance at achieving the respect and admiration of his peers, B. embarks on an absurdist journey that explorescomedy,film theory,philosophy, andsocial commentaryacrossAntkind's 706 pages.[45]
In January 2018, it was announced that Kaufman was working on writing and directingan adaptationofIain Reid's 2016 novelI'm Thinking of Ending Things.[46]In December 2018, it was announced thatBrie LarsonandJesse Plemonswere signed to co-star as the leads; the film was described as "the story of a woman's trip to a family farm that leads to an unexpected detour leaving her stranded, [and] a twisted mix of palpable tension, psychological frailty and sheer terror ensues."[47][48]The project began filming in March 2019, withJessie Buckleyhaving replaced Larson, andToni ColletteandDavid Thewlisjoining the cast, and was released on Netflix in September 2020 to positive reviews.[49][50]
In 2023, Kaufman directed his first short film,Jackals & Fireflies. Based on a poem by Eva H.D., who also portrays the lead character, the film was shot entirely on aSamsung Galaxy S22smartphoneby cinematographer Chayse Irvin.[51]Kaufman has written a script about dreams forRyan Gosling's production company that Gosling may star in and an adaptation of the novelThe Memory PolicethatReed Moranois slated to direct.[52]
Kaufman's works explore such universal themes asidentity crisis,mortality, and themeaning of lifethrough ametaphysicalorparapsychologicalframework. While his work resists labels, it is sometimes described assurrealist.[53]He usesmetafictionas a literary device, and sometimes includes fictionalized "facts" about his life in his work, notablyAdaptation.,Hope Leaves the Theater, andAntkind.Gender identityis also a recurrent theme in his work.[54]Non-human primates also recur in Kaufman's early work: inBeing John Malkovich, Lotte has a pet chimpanzee named Elijah; inHuman Nature, Puff was raised as a chimpanzee; inConfessions of a Dangerous Mind, Penny dreams about a monkey; and inAdaptation, the originaldeus ex machinawas a Bigfoot-like "Swamp Ape".[55]
Some writers and directors Kaufman has named as favorites of his, or as influences, areFranz Kafka,[33]Samuel Beckett,[56]Eugene Ionesco,Stanisław Lem,[57]Flannery O'Connor,[58]Shirley Jackson,[58]Philip K. Dick,[59]Patricia Highsmith,[59]Stephen Dixon,[59]David Lynch,[33]Lars von Trier,[33]Roy Andersson,[33]Woody Allen,[60]and theCoen brothers.[61]He has also mentionedTom Noonan'sWhat Happened Was...as a favorite of his.[62]
As of 2020[update], Kaufman lives inManhattan,[63]having lived inPasadena, California, since 1998.[64][16]He is married to Denise Monaghan,[65]with whom he has a daughter, Anna.[63][66]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
