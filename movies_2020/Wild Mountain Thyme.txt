InCounty Mayo, Ireland, two introverted misfits in their late 30s have lived in adjacent farms their whole lives. Rosemary Muldoon is in love with Anthony Reilly, but he fails to show interest.
In a flashback to their childhood, Anthony smells a flower and gets pollen on his nose. A girl laughs at Anthony, and Rosemary pushes her in anger. Anthony, in turn, pushes Rosemary down. Seeing that she is upset, Rosemary's father plays the score to the balletSwan Lakeand tells her she is the white swan.
In the present, Anthony's father Tony claims his son is not sane. Anthony hears a voice in the fields that tells him "Go," though he does not reveal to where. Tony plans to disinherit Anthony, as he fears hismisanthropicson will not marry and have children, leading to the end of the Reilly legacy. He considers selling the farm to his nephew Adam, who is aNew York Citybanker. Determined to inherit the farm, Anthony plans to propose to Rosemary with his late mother's ring, however he loses it outdoors. He uses a metal detector to search for the ring in his free time.
At Tony's 75th birthday party, Adam arrives and flirts with Rosemary. She likes that Adam is direct and extroverted. He asks her to visit him in New York.
Rosemary's mother falls ill and dies. Tony decides to not sell to Adam, as it would ruin any chance of Anthony and Rosemary getting together. Not long after, Tony is on his death bed. He apologizes to Anthony for almost selling the farm, and they reconcile. Tony dies that night.
Rosemary and Anthony now live alone. She tries to get closer to him, but he pushes her away and suggests she leave Ireland altogether. Rosemary flies to New York to visit Adam. They attend a performance of Swan Lake and have dinner. Adam suggests Rosemary's longing for Anthony is making her miserable. She resists giving up hope.
After returning home, Rosemary finds Anthony on her property with his metal detector. She invites him to her house, where they fight about his difficulty accepting love. Anthony confesses a secret that ruined past relationships: he believes he is a honeybee. Rosemary reveals that she found Anthony's ring, and he finally proposes. He tells her the voice in the fields has been instructing him to go to her all along.
In the local pub, the two sing "Wild Mountain Thyme", and everyone (including their deceased parents) sings along.

It was released in the United States on 11 December 2020.[7]The trailer was released on 10 November 2020,[8][9]and was criticized for its inaccurate Irish accents and  rehashing of hackneyed stereotypes.[10][11][12]Shanley stated that no one would understand the characters if they sounded like his relatives spoke, and "you have to make the accent more accessible to a global audience".[1]
It was the eighth-most rented film onFandangoNowin its debut weekend.[13]

David Ehrlich ofIndieWiregave the film a "C−" and wrote: "Shanley, whose script forMoonstrucksuggests that he once had a slightly tighter handle on this sort of thing, brings his play 'Outside Mullingar' to the screen like he's trying to fill every close-up with enough whimsical enchantment to reach the back row of a Broadway theater. The lethal intensity of this effect cannot be overstated; the only logical explanation for what happened here is that someone planted a bomb in Shanley's editing bay and timed it to explode if any cut ofWild Mountain Thymedipped below 50 kilohertz of cartoon Irish charm per minute."[18]Kevin Maher, chief film critic ofThe Times, described the film's representation of Ireland asanti-Irish, calling it "representationalfascism".[19]
Mick LaSalleof theSan Francisco Chroniclegave the film a positive review: "The gentle spirit ofWild Mountain Thymeenvelops us early, to the extent that, midway through, even though there is very little left to resolve, we are in its spell."[20]The Patricia Danaher of theIrish Independent, while critical of the accents, thought it was "actually quite good" and "worth a watch".[21]Donald Clarke ofThe Irish Timesgave it 1 out of 5 and said "the accents certainly aren't so bad as many have suggested. But this is still stunningly regressive stuff."[22]
The reveal that Anthony considers himself a bee was also ridiculed for its strangeness.[23][24]Karen Han ofSlatedrew comparisons between the protagonists' identities and that offurries,[25]and wondered if John Patrick Shanley intended to portray the characters asotherkin.[25]

Described as "diverse and eccentric"[46]and "one of the most respected actors of his generation",[47]Walken has a long-establishedcult followingamong film fans.[48]He is known for his versatility and was named as one ofEmpiremagazine's "Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time".[49]Once dubbed a "cultural phenomenon",[50]he has portrayed several iconic film characters includingJohnny SmithinThe Dead Zone,Max ShreckinBatman Returns, andMax ZorininA View to a Kill, and was also considered for the role ofHan SoloinStar Warsfilms. His Oscar-winning performance inThe Deer Hunterwas ranked as the 88th greatest film performance of all time byPremieremagazine[51]and his performance inPennies from Heavenmade it intoEntertainment Weekly's list of the "100 Greatest Performances that should have won Oscars but didn't."[52]Sometimes regarded as "one of the kings ofcameos", Walken has made severalcameo appearancesor appeared in a single scene of films including as Captain Koons inPulp Fiction, Duane inAnnie Hall, Hessian Horseman inSleepy Hollowand Don Vincenzo inTrue Romance. Writer and directorQuentin Tarantinodeclared that Walken's involvement inTrue Romance's "Sicilian scene" was one of the proudest moments in his career.[53]
Benicio del Torocited Walken as an influence and stated that the best advice he had ever been given regarding acting came from him: "When you're in a scene and you don't know what you're gonna do, don't do anything."[54]Kat Denningscalled him her favorite actor and said that he was the reason that she wanted to be an actress.[55]Johnny Depponce said one of the main reasons he starred inNick of Timewas wanting to work with Walken.[56]Jeffrey Wright,[57]Mickey Rourke,[58]Sam Rockwell,[59]Colin Farrell,[60]Bradley Cooper,[61]Leonardo DiCaprio[62]andMads Mikkelsen[63]are among actors who spoke about their admiration for Walken. Prominent film criticRoger Ebert, who was particularly impressed by his villain and anti-hero portrayals, once stated, "when he is given the right role, there is nobody to touch him for his chilling ability to move between easy charm and pure evil"[64]and called him "one of the few undeniably charismatic male villains."[65]
Walken is noted for refusing film roles only rarely, having stated in interviews that he will decline a role only if he is too busy to accept. He regards each role as a learning experience.[66]A rare example of a role Walken turned down was that of Ray Ruby in the filmGo Go Tales(2007). According to film directorAbel Ferrara, the character was originally written for Walken, who "didn't want to do it". The role was then given to Walken'sNew Rose Hotel(1998) co-starWillem Dafoe.[67]
Walken's voice and speaking style have been compared to other entertainment figures with voices that create "a pleasing (or at least entertaining) aural experience," such asWilliam ShatnerandGarrison Keillor.[68]Walken believes that the source of his speech stems from growing up with immigrant neighbors who came from everywhere, stating, "The neighborhood itself, you didn't hear a lot of English. Lots of Greek, Italian, Polish, German, Yiddish. I think I grew up listening to people who spoke English in a kind of broken way. I think maybe I talked that way."[69]Walken inspired the stage show,All About Walken: The Impersonators of Christopher Walken, created by actor/comedian Patrick O'Sullivan in Hollywood in 2006.
In 2003, he was voted Number 34 inChannel 4's countdown of the 100 greatest movie stars of all time.[70]
Walken has hosted the comedy sketch and satire TV seriesSaturday Night Live(SNL) seven times.[71]
One of Walken'sSNLperformances was a spoof ofBehind the Music, featuring a recording session ofBlue Öyster Cult's "(Don't Fear) the Reaper". In the guise of record producer Bruce Dickinson (not to be confused with the realBruce Dickinson, lead singer forIron Maiden), Walken makes passionate and slightly unhinged speeches to the band and is obsessed with getting "More Cowbell" into the song. The phrase "I gotta have more cowbell" has since been adapted to merchandise. The producer who suggested the cowbell on the original BÖC recording isDavid Lucas.
Walken appeared in one ofWill FerrellandRachel Dratch's "The Luvahs" skits.[72]His character brought a lady friend to meet The Luvahs and she is subjected to learning the history that Walken's character shares with The Luvahs. He also divulges private information about his sex life with his girlfriend, much to her horror ("She was willing to accept her lover's body in places no one had ever trespassed... specifically, the ear canal").
Walken spoofed his starring role fromThe Dead Zone(1983) in a sketch titled "Ed Glosser: TrivialPsychic" (1992).[73]In the film, Walken's character can predict deaths and catastrophes, while Glosser can accurately predict meaningless, trivial future events but with the same emotional intensity as in the film: "You're going to get anice cream headache. It's going to hurt real bad, right here, [touches forehead] for eight, nine seconds.").
His character inA View to a Killwas parodied in a sketch titled "Lease with an Option to Kill", in which he reprised his role asMax Zorin. Zorin, who had taken on some qualities of other Bond villains (Blofeld's cat and suit,Emilio Largo's eye patch), was upset that everything was going wrong for him. His lair was still under construction; his henchmen had jump suits that didn't fit; and his shark tank lacked sharks, having a giantsea spongeinstead. A captiveJames Bond, portrayed byPhil Hartman, offered to get Zorin "a good deal" on the abandoned Blofeld volcanic lair if Zorin let him go, to which he reluctantly agreed.
He performed a song and dance rendition of theIrving Berlinstandard, "Let's Face the Music and Dance". Finally, there was the "Colonel Angus" sketch,[74]laden with ribalddouble entendres, in which Walken played a dishonoredConfederateofficer.
Until 2003, Walken had a recurringSNLsketch called "The Continental",[75]in which Walken played a "suave ladies' man" who in reality cannot do anything to keep a woman (a neighbor in his apartment building) from giving him the cold shoulder. Though he is outwardly chivalrous, his more perverted tendencies inevitably drive away his date over his pleading objections. For instance, he invites the woman to wash up in his bathroom; once she is inside, it becomes obvious that the bathroom mirror is atwo-way mirrorwhen he is seen lighting up a cigarette. In "The Continental", only the hand of his neighbor is ever seen; the camera always shows her point of view.
The April 5, 2008Saturday Night Liveshow was the first time an episode hosted by Walken did not have a "Continental" sketch or a monologue in which he sang and danced. This episode, however, did include one sketch titled "Walken Family Reunion",[76]which spoofs many of Walken'sidiosyncrasies. The sketch depicts a fictional Walkenfamily reunion, where all of Christopher's relatives have his mannerisms and speech patterns and sport his trademarkpompadour hairstyle. In order of appearance, the other Walkens are Christopher's cousin Stanley (Bill Hader); Stanley's brother John (Jason Sudeikis); John's son Scott (Andy Samberg) and daughter Maxine (Amy Poehler) (who carries adollthat also has a pompadour); Nathan (Fred Armisen), a gay relative for whom "flamboyance" means dressing all in black and running his finger around the rim of acosmoglass; Uncle Richard (Darrell Hammond) and Aunt Martha (Kristen Wiig), who think thatThe Deer Hunterwas hilarious and who are hosts of aNigerianforeign exchange studentnamed Oleki (Kenan Thompson). When he came to live with them, Oleki—who has absorbed all of the Walken Family traits—could not speak any English. But now (he says) he "talks like a normal teenaged American boy". The biggest laugh of the sketch occurs when Christopher expresses his sympathies for Scott's teenaged attitude: "I appreciate your situation. For a Walken, adolescence is a difficult time. You feel like you're the only normal person in a school full of nutjobs." Scott's response: "Wow! It's like you're lookin' right into my noggin!" (Will Fortealso appears as a waiter at the beginning of the sketch, but does not do a Walken impression.)
In September 2004,SNLreleased a DVD titledThe Best of Christopher WalkenthroughLionsgate.[77]
Walken returned to the show for the first time in 15 years on October 28, 2023, in a cameo role as the "Spirit of Halloween" in which he gave advice toPresident Joe Biden(Mikey Day). Walken also introduced the musical guestFoo Fightersinstead of hostNate Bargatze. Foo Fighters were the musical guest during his 2003 episode, during whichDave Grohlpranked Walken into speaking with the emphasis on "Fighters" instead of "Foo". Clips of the introduction later became aninternet memeand Walken pronounced the band's name correctly in 2023.
Walken became the subject of a hoax controversy in 2006, when a fake website started in August of that year by members of Internet forum Genmay.com announced that he was running for President of the United States. Some believed it was authentic, until Walken's publicist dismissed the claims.[78]When asked about the hoax in a September 2006 interview withConan O'Brien, Walken said he was amused and when asked to come up with a campaign slogan, he replied, "What the Heck" and "No More Zoos!"[78]
In 1963, Walken metGeorgianne Thonduring a tour ofWest Side Story.[79]They married in January 1969. The couple have no children, and Walken has stated in interviews that not having children is one of the reasons that he has had such a prolific career.[80]
Walken discussed his feelings on sexuality in a 1973 interview withAfter Darkwhile promoting his appearance asBassanioinThe Merchant of Venice. "I suppose I think of the man I'm playing as bisexual, and I suppose that's how I think of myself too. I'd hate to think that I was harnessed to heterosexuality. I mean, my life is heterosexual, but I like to think that my head is bisexual, and I think it's a good idea for everybody to start getting used to that notion, because that way one becomes aware of a lot more things."[81]
On November 29, 1981, Walken was withNatalie WoodandRobert Wagneron Wagner's yacht the night Wood went missing and ultimately was found dead by drowning. Walken was not considered a suspect by authorities.[82]The case was re-opened in November 2011; Walken was once again not considered a suspect and he fully co-operated with authorities conducting the investigation.[83]
In an interview withThe Wall Street Journal, Walken said, "I don't have technology. I only have a satellite dish on my house. So I've seenSeveranceon DVDs that they're good enough to send me. I don't have a cell phone. I've never emailed or, what do you call it, Twittered."[84][85]
