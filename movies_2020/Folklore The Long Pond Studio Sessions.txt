Antonoff was born on March 31, 1984, inBergenfield, New Jersey.[3]He is the second of three children of Shira (Wall) and Rick Antonoff.[4]He is the younger brother of fashion designerRachel Antonoff.[5]His younger sister, Sarah, died of brain cancer at the age of 13 when Jack was a senior in high school.[6]The event had a profound effect on him, "my whole career has been revisiting that through a different lens."[7]Antonoff isJewish.[8][9]He grew up inNew Milford, New Jersey, andWoodcliff Lake, New Jerseyand attended elementary school at theSolomon Schechter Day Schoolof Bergen County.[10][11]He and Rachel commuted toManhattanto attend theProfessional Children's School.[5]
During his sophomore year of high school, in November 1998, he and several friends from elementary school formed apunk rockband called Outline.[10]They released a self-titled EP through Lifetime Records, a friend's record label, in January 2000. Antonoff initially sang in the group until early 2000 when Eddie Wright took over on vocals.[12]With the addition of Wright, they recorded six songs which were later released[13]as6 Song Demoin the summer.[14]They released an album,A Boy Can Dream, in July 2001 throughTriple Crown Records.[13]When they were 15, Antonoff and his Outline bandmate used aDIYguide to book shows in numerous states, includingFloridaandTexas, and borrowed Antonoff's parents' minivan to travel in. During the tour, Outline played in venues such as anarchist bookstores, while the oldest member of the band drove because he was 18 years old. Antonoff explained in 2014: "Half the time no one would show up or the equipment would be too fucked up to play... but that's when I fell in love with touring." The band lasted until 2002.[6][10]
In 2002, Antonoff and friendScott Irby-Ranniarformed the bandSteel Train. Antonoff was the lead singer,[15]and they recruited drummer Matthias Gruber. The band then convinced two of their friends from the band Random Task, Evan Winiker and Matthew Goldman, to drop out of college to join the new band.[10]Steel Train secured a recording deal withDrive-Thru Records.[10]The group was popular on the jamband festival circuit and Antonoff has said he has applied that grassroots mentality to his future projects.[16]
In 2008,Nate Ruess(formerly the frontman ofthe Format) asked Antonoff to join him andAndrew Dost(formerly ofAnathallo) in a new band, which becameFun.[17]Antonoff was already well acquainted with Ruess and Dost, as their former bands had all toured together.[17]The new band released its debut album,Aim and Ignite, in 2009.[18]Fun's second album,Some Nights(2012), produced the band's first number-one hit single, "We Are Young".

Live in the USA.[18]
Antonoff announced a solo project calledBleachersin February 2014.[21]Antonoff stated in June 2014 that the project had been a consideration for around 10 years, and the name was inspired by the "disconnected, darker side" of suburban youth andJohn Hughesmovies, which were "tied to a time when big songs were great songs." The songs for the debut Bleachers album were mostly written on Antonoff's laptop computer in hotel rooms during a Fun. world tour.[6]
The Huffington Postpublished a positive review of Bleachers' first single, "I Wanna Get Better"—released on February 18—calling it the "catchiest song of 2014,"[22]whileTimeproclaimed, "[Bleachers] is more fun than Fun."[23]Antonoff revealed the intent behind the debut single in aRolling Stoneinterview:
I wanted to bridge the gap between Disclosure and Arcade Fire—something both streamlined and organic... The production and songwriting is extremely over-the-top, extremely epic and unapologetic. The record is all about finding a world where you can be kind to yourself in.[21]
Antonoff toldRolling Stonethat while the song may sound joyous, "it's very desperate" and, like many of the other songs on the album is about loss.[21]Antonoff worked with producers John Hill andVince Clarkeon the Bleachers studio album, as he sought to create "massive, beautiful pop songs that sound __ cool." The completed album,Strange Desire, was released in July 2014, and "I Wanna Get Better" peaked at number one on the U.S. Alternative charts during the same week. In regard toStrange Desire, Antonoff said:
It doesn't have to be one or the other... You don't have to [make] big pop songs that sound stupid and you don't have to make these fuckin' apologetic, tired droney songs that sound incredible. I really wanted both things to happen.[21]
"I Wanna Get Better" was eventually named number 18 inRolling Stone's 50 Best Songs of 2014, with the publication describing the song as "therapy rock" that is "as fun as it is cathartic".[24]Antonoff released Bleachers' second albumGone Nowon June 2, 2017.

Music is central to Antonoff's life; he explained in June 2014:
I need a hobby, and I don't want it to be basketball ... I want it to be music. So to get away from music, I do other music. If I'm producing someone's song or writing with someone else, then doing a Bleachers song or a Fun song is an escape and it keeps me creative and it keeps me locked into what I want to do. If something's making me crazy, I need to go somewhere else and I don't want that thing to be yoga.[6]

He graduated from Memorial High in 1999 and attended college at theUniversity of Wisconsin–Eau Claire, spending a semester in Ireland.[9]Vernon majored in Religious Studies and minored in Women's Studies. In an interview onThe Colbert Report, he said that was because, at the time, he hadn't been ready to study music.[10]
In 2001, Vernon released his first solo album under the name "J.D Vernon", titledHome Is. He went on to release two other solo albums, namelySelf Recordin 2005, which was followed shortly thereafter byHazeltonsin 2006.[11]Vernon founded the bandDeYarmond Edisonin 2001 while still in college.[12][13]
The band, which began performing in 2002, consisted of Vernon,Phil Cook,Christopher Porterfield, and Joe Westerlund. After playing in the Eau Claire music scene, the four bandmates decided to leave their longtime home and move toRaleigh, North Carolina, to try their musical hand in a new place. The band released two records themselves, the first self-titled in 2004 and the second titledSilent Signsin 2005,[14]and an EP of unreleased material is available on theirMyspacepage.[15]In 2006, after nearly a year in Raleigh, Vernon returned to Wisconsin after a breakup with the band and a girlfriend.

When asked for reasoning, he replied, "[I'm] winding it down. I look at it like a faucet. I have to turn it off and walk away from it because so much of how that music comes together is subconscious or discovering. There's so much attention on the band, it can be distracting at times. I really feel the need to walk away from it while I still care about it. And then if I come back to it – if at all – I'll feel better about it and be renewed or something to do that."[18]
The band's third studio album,22, A Million, was released on September 30, 2016, to critical acclaim. The album marked a major shift in Bon Iver's musical style, with prominent uses ofelectronic instrumentationandvoice modulation, a contrast to Vernon's previous acoustic style.
