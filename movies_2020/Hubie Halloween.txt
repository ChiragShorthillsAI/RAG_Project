InSalem, Massachusetts, Hubie Dubois, a friendly, but dimwitted and cowardlydelicatessenemployee, isbulliedby most of the city, and the victim of manypractical jokes. He has annoyed police sergeants Steve Downey and Blake, and Father Dave for ages. Hubie spends hisHalloweensmonitoring the city as the official Halloween Helper.
The day before Halloween, Hubie meets his strange new neighbor Walter Lambert, and news spreads around town about Richie Hartman, a convict and childhood friend of Hubie who has absconded from a localmental institution.
On Halloween day Hubie, working as Halloween Monitor, investigates Walter's home after hearing strange noises. Reporting this to the police, he is "recruited" by Downey as an "AUU" (auxiliary undercover unit). Hubie believes this assignment is genuine, but it is really just something Steve tells Hubie in hopes it will prevent Hubie from bothering him.
Hubie goes to a local Halloween party to monitor the activities, however, it soon turns sour. He is tricked into going into acorn mazeseeking a lost child. Hubie's young co-worker Mike follows hoping to scare Hubie. He finds Mike and watches him get pulled into the maze and then disappear.
Hubie moves his attention to adrive-in cinema, where his old classmates Lester and Mary Hennessey scare him. They falsely report suspicious activity in one of the cars (who turn out to be trick-or-treaters driven by Mr. Hennessey to throweggsat Hubie). Hubie flees into the woods and finds Walter, who thinks he is turning into awerewolf. He chases Hubie to ahaunted housein afun fairthat is overseen by Chantal Taylor. Mr. and Mrs. Hennessey are kidnapped and Sgt. Downey is alerted.
At the haunted house, Hubie sees a maleSiberian Husky, believing he is Walter in his final form. The dogdefecatesandeats his own feceswhile Hubie attempts to interrogate and confront him, runs into the haunted house and he chases him inside. It is eventually shown that the Husky is Miss Taylor's dog named Buster. Pete Landolfa goes in to scare Hubie, but is kidnapped right in front of him.
Sgt. Downey arrives and suggests to Mayor Benson that they cancel Halloween. Hubie thinks it is Walter, but then Blake calls Downey. Walter has been at the police station with Richie, as they had turned themselves in. Walter's real name is Nick Hudson and Richie had escaped to bring him back to the mental institution, which they refer to as the werewolf treatment center. Downey, Benson, and Dave believe that Hubie is the kidnapper and is getting revenge on his bullies. He runs away and goes to theradio station.
DJAurora tells Hubie that someone calls a lot more than him always requesting a song for Hubie. They all think Violet Valentine, Sgt. Downey's ex-wife and Hubie’s love interest since his childhood, is the caller. The planted burner phone rings, revealing it to be in Hubie's house. Hubie races there, hoping his mother is okay.
Hubie arrives to discover his mother is the kidnapper, having taken Pete, Mike, and the Hennesseys as revenge for tormenting Hubie, and plans to burn them alive. He rescues them just as the police, the news media, Nick, and Richie arrive, but they are still ungrateful. His mother then scolds them all for the things they did to Hubie and they admit that they were jealous of him for various reasons. Hubie's mother suddenly disappears upon using theFrankensteintrick.
One year later, Hubie is married to Violet, is the newmayorof Salem, and his new foster kids are goingtrick or treatingdressed like people they know. Having earned respect from the locals, Hubie goes into town on his bicycle with Downey escorting him and prepares for the Halloween festivities.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
