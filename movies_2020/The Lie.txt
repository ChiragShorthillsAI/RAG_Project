Divorced father Jay drives his daughter Kayla to aballetretreat. On the way, they find Kayla's friend, Britney, waiting on the side of the road, and give her a lift to the same retreat. After pulling over so Britney can go to the bathroom in the woods, Jay hears Kayla scream and finds her sitting alone on a bridge over a river. Kayla claims she pushed Britney off the bridge. Jay checks the area for Britney's body, but does not find it and assumes she drowned and was washed away. Kayla finds Britney's purse and they go to see Kayla's mother, Rebecca, an attorney.
At Rebecca's home, Kayla tells her that she murdered Britney. Britney's father, Sam, arrives in search of his daughter. When he asks to speak to Kayla, Rebecca lies, saying she is at the doctor. Later on, Sam gets suspicious and returns to discover that Rebecca lied and Kayla is at home. After a physical altercation with Jay, Sam threatens to go to the police. Noting that Britney had a bruise on her face, Jay convinces Rebecca to try and put suspicion on Sam for the disappearance. She contacts a police associate, Detective Kenji Tagata, to accuse Sam of abusing Britney. When Kenji interrogates Sam, he denies hitting Britney and admits that she has run away before. Kenji interviews Kayla, who says that Sam has a bad temper and hit Britney before.
Sam spots Kayla outside Jay's apartment and tries to grab her, but she retreats back into the house as he is chasing her, banging on the windows, and screaming her name. Jay and Rebecca try to bury Britney's phone behind Sam's house, but he catches them in the act. Before they flee, Sam tells them that he knows Kayla killed Britney. When Sam appears in front of their car, Rebecca purposefully drives into him. Jay and Rebecca consider calling for help before letting him bleed to death and leaving his corpse in the road.
The next morning, as Jay and Rebecca scrub Sam's blood off her car, Britney suddenly appears, alive and well, asking to speak to Kayla. Britney admits her disappearance was no more than an elaborate ruse between her and Kayla to allow for Britney to visit her boyfriend. Britney becomes uncomfortable and leaves after noticing a bloodied rag, and their suspicious reactions. Jay and Rebecca confront Kayla, who tearfully admits that she went along with Britney's plan, and escalated the lie by pretending to "push" Britney off the bridge, hoping that the pseudo-tragedy would bring her divorced parents back together. As the family embrace and Kayla begs her parents not to leave her, the doorbell rings and incoming police sirens are heard.

Kate Erbland ofIndieWirewrote, "Too stupid to be the hard-hitting drama it was first sold as and too self-important to be theblack comedyit really should be, Sud's film is a master class in bad decision-making, improbable choices, and overwrought acting."[12]A.A. Dowd ofThe A.V. Clubgave it a C- grade, calling the film "laughably ludicrous" and saying that it "seems to fancy itself a meditation on the extremes parents will go to on their children's behalf, but it's curiously disinterested in what should be its driving dramatic force: how Kayla's crime—and how little it seems to weigh on her conscience—might challenge their unconditional love for her."[13]RogerEbert.com's Nick Allen gave it 1.5/4 stars, writing, "Very little about this movie works, in spite of a certain ambition in telling a story based solely on unfathomable decisions."[14]
The Guardian's Phil Hoad gave it 4/5 stars, writing, "the couple are so blinkered in protecting their offspring that it preventsThe Liefrom entering more psychologically torn territory that might have made it profound. Instead it's merely car-crash compelling."[15]Al Horner ofEmpiregave it 3/5 stars, calling it "A watchable tale of parental dread, propelled by a strong conceit and sustained tension - but let down by its outlandish twist."[16]
