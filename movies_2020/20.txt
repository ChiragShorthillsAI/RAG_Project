A woman named Diane Sherman gives birth to aprematurebaby, whom she goes to see lying in anincubator, surrounded by the hospital staff. Years later, Diane lives a quiet life with her now teenage daughter, Chloe. Due to the circumstances of her birth, Chloe suffers fromarrhythmia,hemochromatosis,asthma, anddiabetes, as well asparalysisin her legs. She uses awheelchair, takes multiplemedicationsdaily, and ishomeschooledby her mother. Chloe desires to go tocollege, something Diane seems to support, but has received no responses for her applications.
One morning, while looking through a bag of groceries forchocolate, Chloe finds aprescriptionbottle of green pills with Diane's name on the label. However, when Chloe later inspects the bottle, she finds a label bearing her name has been pasted over the original. She tries to research the name of the pills—Trigoxin—but discovers the house has no internet connection, unaware Diane is watching her with the router unplugged. The next day, Chloe dials a random number from her mother's bedroom phone, and asks the answering stranger to look up the drug. He tells her it is a heart medication and that all pictures of the medication show a small red pill.
Later, while pretending to go to thebathroomat themovie theater, Chloe rushes to the nearbypharmacyacross the street. The pharmacist at the desk reveals the green pills are actually arelaxantcalled Ridocaine, which had been only approved fordogsand, if they were being taken by a human, it could paralyze their legs. Chloe begins tohyperventilatebefore Diane runs in andsedatesher to take her home.
Chloe wakes up in bed and finds her bedroom door locked from the outside, while Diane is out running an errand. She breaks out of her room by dragging herself onto the roof, eventually making her way to her mother's bedroom and breaking the window with asoldering ironandwater. She begins to have an asthma attack and only barely manages to crawl to her room to retrieve herinhaler. She tries to use her automated wheelchair ramp to go downstairs, but finds that Diane has cut the power cord. She is forced to throw her wheelchair down the stairs and accidentally falls, sustaining minor injuries but also discovering that she can move one of her toes, due to having not taken Ridocaine in the last few days.
Outside down the road, Chloe sees amail truckand rushes to stop it; she explains her situation to Tom, thepostal worker, who agrees to help her. Diane pulls up and Chloe asks Tom to contact thepolice. He, however, confronts Diane and tells her she can't take Chloe home. While closing up the van to take Chloe to thepolice station, Diane suddenly appears and stabs Tom in the neck with a syringe. Chloe hyperventilates again andblacks out. When she awakens, she is in thebasementof her house, with her wheelchair chained to a steel pole as Diane drags Tom's body through her hallway.
While in the basement, Chloe discovers her childhood photos, which show her walking, adeath certificatefor a girl named Chloe who died two hours and eleven minutes after her birth, and an article about a couple who had their babystolenfrom the same hospital. She also finds college acceptance letters that were hidden from her. When Diane enters, Chloe accuses her ofpoisoningher along withlying to her about her medical conditionsand demands the truth. Diane insists everything she ever did was to help and protect Chloe, exclaiming that she saved her. Diane then fills a syringe withpaint thinner, saying it will make her forget. Terrified, Chloe crawls away and locks herself in a closet. She then swallows a bottle oforganophosphate, forcing Diane to rush her to the hospital.
Chloe wakes up in a hospital bed,intubatedand barely able to move. Diane insists that her "daughter" be discharged, but the doctors refuse until Chloe has been evaluated by amental health professional. Chloe signals to anurse, who brings her acrayonandpaper. While Chloe is attempting to write "MOM" on the paper, acode blueis called and the nurse rushes out. Armed with ahandgun, Diane then sneaks in and ties Chloe to a wheelchair to escape; the nurse finds the bed empty and alerts hospital security. As Diane tries to find an exit, Chloe is able to move her foot and hold the chair in place. Chloe replies that she doesn't need her but Diane viciously states she will. Diane aims her gun at security guards, yelling "We are going home!" as she is cornered and shot in the arm, causing her to fall down the stairs.
Seven years later, Chloe still relies on her wheelchair, although is able to walk short distances using a cane. She visits 
acorrectional facilitywhere Diane is confined to a bed in the infirmary ward. Chloe then talks about the life she had built for herself: her husband, Ara, daughter, Annie, and work. She mentions that Annie has a preference ingrandparents, implying that Chloe had been reunited with herbirth parents.

It was launched on October 29, 2007, initially as ajoint venturebetweenNews Corporation(later21st Century Fox) andNBC Universal, which was laterbought byComcast. Many companies likeAT&T'sWarnerMedia,Providence Equity, and the Walt Disney Company bought stakes in the service. Hulu served as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from the respectivetelevision broadcastingby its owners. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initiallybrandedas "Hulu Plus," which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and un-delayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—anover-the-topstreaming television service offering access tobroadcast televisionchannels.
In 2011, Hulu launchedits services in Japan, marking its first and only international expansion. Three years later in 2014, Hulu Japan was acquired byNippon TVand spun off from its American counterpart.[2]Since February 2021, Hulu's original content has since been distributed outside of the U.S. viaDisney+under theStarbrand. In 2019, Disney acquired a majority stake in Hulu as part of itsacquisition of 21st Century Fox, and subsequently acquired the remaining stakes held by AT&T and Comcast in 2019 and 2023, respectively, giving it full ownership. After the acquisition, Disneysoft launchedan integration of Hulu into Disney+ as a content hub in December 2023, allowing subscribers of both services to access Hulu content from within the Disney+ app. Hulu is one of the three streaming services in the Disney Bundle, alongside Disney+ andESPN+.
On January 6, 2025, Disney began its acquisition of a 70% stake inFuboTV, with the latter merging with Hulu's Live TV service. The combined company will remain publicly traded on theNew York Stock Exchange, but will be controlled by Disney executives.

Discovery(WarnerMedia's successor after its merger withDiscovery, Inc.) over a joint venture known asVenu Sports, with Fubo being granted a preliminary injection to stop its launch in August 2024.

The name Hulu comes from twoMandarin Chinesephrases,húlu(葫芦;葫蘆; "calabash, bottle gourd") andhùlù(互录;互錄; "interactive recording").[3]
Jason Kilar, who served as CEO of Hulu, said the name comes from aChinese proverb:
Hulu is Mandarin for gourd. And so when we were launching Hulu, we thought, "what a great name that is." And it had this great sort of symbolism of the holder of precious things, which is the holder of premium content. So that's why we named it Hulu.[4]
Individuals who were instrumental[vague]in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell,[5]Peter Chernin,[6]JB Perrette,[7]Mike Lang,[8]Beth Comstock, George Kliavkoff, Darren Feher, andJason Kilar.Rus Yusupov, the lead designer on Hulu's original design team, played a key role in shaping the platform's initial interface and user experience.[9]Hulu was announced in March 2007 withAOL,NBCUniversal(then co-owned byGeneral ElectricandVivendi),MSN,Myspace(then owned byNews Corporation), andYahoo!planned as "initial distribution partners."

In July 2007,Providence Equity, the owner ofNewport Television, became one of the earliest "outside" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 millionequity investment,[17]before the company was known as "Hulu."[18]With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an "independent voice on the board."[18]In April 2009,the Walt Disney Companyjoined the Hulu consortium as a stakeholder, with plans to offer content fromABC,ESPNandDisney Channel.[19][20][21][22]
Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.ComScoresays monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier,[23]and second only toYouTube.[24]On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning aninitial public offering(IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.[25][26]
In June 2011, an "unsolicited offer" caused Hulu to begin "weighing whether to sell itself".[27]However, Hulu and its owners refused to sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.[28]In September of that year, theservicelaunched inJapan; marking Hulu's first and only international expansion.[29]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
