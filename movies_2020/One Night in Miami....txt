One Night in Miami...is a 2020 Americandrama filmdirected byRegina King(in her feature filmdirectorial debut) from a screenplay byKemp Powers, based onhis 2013 stage play. The film is a fictionalized account of a meeting on February 25, 1964, betweenMalcolm X,Muhammad Ali,Jim Brown, andSam Cookein a room at theHampton House, celebrating Ali's surprise title win overSonny Liston. It starsKingsley Ben-Adir,Eli Goree,Aldis Hodge, andLeslie Odom Jr.in the lead roles, withLance Reddick,Joaquina Kalukango,Nicolette Robinson, andBeau Bridgesin supporting roles.
One Night in Miamipremiered at the77th Venice International Film Festivalon September 7, 2020, a first for an African-American female director.[5]The film was released in limited theaters byAmazon Studioson December 25, 2020, before being released digitally onAmazon Prime Videoon January 15, 2021. It received praise for King's direction, the performances (particularly from Ben-Adir and Odom), and Powers's screenplay. The film earned three nominations at the93rd Academy Awards:Best Supporting Actorfor Odom,Best Adapted Screenplay, andBest Original Song("Speak Now"). King also earned nominations for theGolden Globe Award for Best Directorand theCritics Choice Award for Best Director.
In 1963,Cassius Claynearly loses a boxing match toHenry CooperatWembley StadiuminLondon. At theCopacabanain New York City, soul singerSam Cookesuffers through a performance in front of a cold, all-white audience. Returning home toGeorgia,NFLplayerJim Brownis received by family friend Mr. Carlton on a vast plantation. Carlton ladles praise on "the great Jim Brown," but when Brown offers to help Carlton move some furniture, Carlton uses a racial slur and informs Brown that he is not welcome inside the home due to Brown's blackness. Elsewhere,Malcolm Xreturns home and discusses his plans to leave theNation of Islamwith his wife,Betty.
On February 25, 1964, the men are all inMiamifor Clay's title bout againstSonny Liston. Malcolm meets with Clay in a hotel room before the fight, and the twoprayin a traditionalIslamicfashion. That night, Brown is a ringside commentator and Cooke and Malcolm X are in the crowd as Clay upsets Liston, making him the world heavyweight champion.
Afterward, Malcolm invites the other three men to his motel room. Their hopes of a party are dashed when Malcolm makes it clear they are the only ones he invited. He wants to spend some time reflecting on their accomplishments, but tension between him and Cooke arises. Malcolm accuses Cooke of disloyalty to the black community by pandering to white audiences, and Cooke argues that his method produces greater economic empowerment for black artists. Clay informs the men of his plans to announce his conversion to the Nation of Islam, causing more tension. Brown discusses his plans to become a film actor, and wonders if it will go smoothly.
The conflict between Malcolm and Cooke escalates. Malcolm harshly ridicules the music Cooke has produced since finding success. Cooke insists his success and creative autonomy is itself an inspiration to the black community, and while he still cares about the black struggle in America,protest songsare not commercially viable. Malcolm confronts him with the success ofBob Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind".
As they argue, it becomes clear that Malcolm's antagonism of Cooke is motivated, at least in part, by the activist's stress over his own life, especially his harassment by theFBIand fears about his schism withElijah Muhammad. Malcolm is devastated to learn that Clay is having second thoughts about his conversion. He tells Clay that he is planning to formhis own organizationand asks him to join. Clay refuses, feeling betrayed by his mentor, and wondering if his conversion has been a ploy by Malcolm to attract attention to his new project. A knock at the door informs them that the press has gotten wind of the meeting. As Clay prepares to talk to the media, he asks Malcolm to come with him. When they leave, Cooke tells Brown that he has had similar thoughts about "Blowin' in the Wind" and has already written a song, but not yet performed it.
In the aftermath of the night, Clay officially changes his name to Muhammad Ali, while Malcolm's life is thrown into chaos as he suffers the consequences of his split with the Nation of Islam; his house is firebombed, but he completeshis autobiography. Cooke debuts "A Change Is Gonna Come" onThe Tonight Show. Brown leaves the NFL to pursue his movie career. The film ends with a title card with a quote from Malcolm on February 19, 1965, about the inevitability ofmartyrsfor the cause, and that he was assassinated two days later on February 21.

Kate Erbland ofIndieWiregave the film an "A−" and said that "Yes,One Night in Miamioften looks like the play it's based on, but King and her stars make the most of any stage-y limitations, and the filmmaker frequently turns her eye to well-assembled overhead shots and a graceful use of mirrors to keep her many characters in the frame all at once."[32]Owen GleibermanofVarietypraised the characters and the film's parallels to modern day, writing: "One Night in Miamiis a casually entrancing debate about power on the part of those who have won it but are still figuring out what to do with it."[33]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
