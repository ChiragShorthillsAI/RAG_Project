Money Planeis a 2020 Americanaction filmdirected byAndrew Lawrenceand starringAdam Copeland,Kelsey Grammer,Thomas Jane, andDenise Richards. It was released to video-on-demand services on July 10, 2020, byQuiver Distribution.
At an art museum, Jack Reese, a professional thief and former gambler, attempts to stealThe Disturbing Duckling, a (fictional) painting byAsger Jorn, with the help of his crew, consisting of Isabella Voltaic, Trey Peterson, and Iggy. When Jack enters the museum, he finds out that the painting is no longer there and that he and his team have been compromised, forcing them to flee empty-handed.
Without any other options, Jack goes to the house of the man who hired Reese and his crew for the heist in the first place, notorious gang leader Darius Grouch III, nicknamed "The Rumble". Already in debt to The Rumble before the botched heist, and under the threat of harm to his family, Jack takes one more job from him to clear his debt: He has to sneak aboard the "Money Plane", an airborne casino that caters to elite criminals, in order to steal its reserves ofcryptocurrencyand hard cash. The night before embarking on the heist, Jack has his best friend, Harry Greer, keep an eye on his family while he is gone, and Harry also offers to look into how the museum heist got compromised.
Jack and Trey board the plane under the guises of two human traffickers named Monroe and McGillicuddy, while Isabella poses as one of the flight attendants. As the plane takes off, two employees, codenamed the "Concierge" and "Bookkeeper", welcome their guests, explaining the activities and amenities on board while informing them of the plane's zero-tolerance stance on cheating. After several hands ofTexas hold 'empoker, Jack leaves Trey in the main gambling room to subdue the pilots and take control of the plane. During the flight, Trey improbably wins a series of games on the plane (includingRussian rouletteand betting on the outcome of a fight between a man and a cobra). Meanwhile, Jack establishes contact with Iggy, who is on the ground to facilitate the transfer of the plane's cryptocurrency, as well as taking calls from The Rumble, who demands to be kept in the loop with the mission and reminds Jack of the consequences should the team fail.
In the plane's vault, Isabella breaks off to secure the hard cash that they need to steal, getting into a fight with a guard, whom she kills before he can blow her cover. Meanwhile, Jack calls Harry while in-air, who reveals thatThe Disturbing Ducklingwas already owned by The Rumble and that they are beingset up to fail. In too deep to back out, the crew elects to keep going with the heist while asking Harry to work on a "fail-safe" measure on the ground.
Trey and Isabella work on securing the server room where the cryptocurrency is stored, and Iggy establishes a secure link between him and the plane to start transferring the cryptocurrency. However, the team on the plane are attacked by two of the Money Plane's guests, who caught wind of their actions, and Iggy is ambushed by assassins who are implied to be on The Rumble's payroll. Trey and Isabella manage to fight off and kill their attackers, while Iggy is saved by a handgun-toting drone piloted by Harry. However, the servers have been damaged during the fight, forcing them to download the cryptocurrency onto a USB drive, which, if used, would alert the Money Plane.
A team of assassins is sent to Jack's home to kill his family, but Harry, revealed to be present, guns them down. Meanwhile, the team decides to not keep any of the money and instead donate it to charitable causes around the world, with special focus on those affected by guests of the Money Plane. Jack makes one final call to The Rumble, who is angered by the team's betrayal, but is stunned when Jack reveals he has played a clip of The Rumble stating his identity and his intentions to rob the Money Plane over the plane's radio, sealing his fate. The team escapes the plane via an emergency exit door while letting the hard cash fall out of it. Meanwhile, the Money Plane has assassins sent to The Rumble’s house to kill him.
Three months after the heist, two warehouse workers inIstanbulopen a painting shipping case only to find out that the artwork inside has been stolen and replaced. Back home, it is revealed that Jack and his crew have stolenThe Disturbing Ducklingand that the price has been driven up to 60 million dollars, which Jack has split up five ways between him, his crew, and Harry, ensuring that they all have enough money to retire.
Inspired by heist films such asOcean's Eleven, airplane films such asCon Air, and their experiences in Las Vegas, producers Switzer and Konney turned to Andrew Lawrence. Lawrence proposed an airplane casino film, which Switzer and Konney agreed to fund after Lawrence wrote a screenplay. After securing Adam Copeland for the role of Jack Reese, the producers cast Thomas Jane as Reese's mentor. Kelsey Grammer was their first casting choice for Darius Grouch, though they did not expect him to accept the role. To their surprise, Grammer accepted, later saying that the role "seemed like a fun, mustache-twirling kind of character."[3]
Principal photography began in October 2019[4]and continued through late December.[5][6]After plans to film in Romania and Toronto proved unworkable, the production moved toBaton Rouge. The project's low budget and rushed schedule frequently required Lawrence to improvise and to adjust shooting based on which sets were available: "We were literally building the plane set while we were shooting ... We picked corners of the set that were built, and shot in those corners. We had to do that all the time," he said.[3]After post-production early in the year, the film was released in July 2020.
Money Planereceived an overall negative critical reception. As of 10 October 2021[update], the film holds a 23% approval rating onRotten Tomatoes, based on 13 reviews with an average rating of 3.6/10.[7]The Daily BeastdescribedMoney Planeas "the dumbest movie of 2020".[8]The Action Elite gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5 and called it "the kind of movie that will likely be forgotten about within a matter of weeks".[9]A review from Decider said that it was "the best and worst of what a bad movie experience can be".[10]Red Letter Mediareviewed the film in extreme detail on an episode ofHalf in the Bag.[11]They derided its script, performances, and production value, conceding that the only positive is that it's "a new movie" amidst theCOVID-19 pandemic.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
