A Rainy Day in New Yorkis a 2019 Americanromantic comedyfilm written and directed byWoody Allen, and starringTimothée Chalamet,Elle Fanning,Selena Gomez,Jude Law,Diego Luna, andLiev Schreiber. The film follows the romantic exploits of two young college students, Gatsby and Ashleigh (Chalamet and Fanning), while on a weekend visit to New York City, Gatsby's hometown. He hopes to deepen their relationship while she is in the city to interview a film director (Schreiber) for their college newspaper.
The film was completed in 2018, but its distributor,Amazon Studios, halted its release following theMe Too movementand the resurgence of thesexual abuse allegation against Allen. It was released in Poland on July 26, 2019, followed by releases in multiple European, South American, and Asian countries. It was released in the United States on October 9, 2020, byMPI Media Groupand Signature Entertainment. The film received generally mixed reviews from critics.
Gatsby Welles, the brainy but eccentric son of wealthy New York City-based parents, is a student at Yardley College, a liberal arts school inupstate New York. He is also a successfulgambler. When his girlfriend, Ashleigh Enright, a journalism major fromTucson, has to travel toManhattanto interview esteemed independent film director Roland Pollard for the student newspaper, Gatsby tags along, planning a romantic weekend in the city, while trying to avoid his parents who are holding a gala in the evening, and with whom he has a conflicted relationship.
Ashleigh's interview with Pollard is supposed to last one hour, but the director invites her to a private screening of his new film, which ruins her plans with Gatsby, much to his dismay. Strolling alone through New York, Gatsby bumps into a film student friend who is shooting a short film and who asks him to stand in for a missing actor for a shot that involves kissing his co-star. To Gatsby's surprise, the actress turns out to be Chan Tyrell, the younger sister of a former girlfriend. The two of them run into each other again when they both hail the same cab. Gatsby's romantic plans with Ashleigh are further delayed by Ashleigh getting increasingly involved with Pollard, who is having a creative crisis, and his long-suffering screenwriter, Ted Davidoff.
Feeling abandoned and without an itinerary, Gatsby accompanies Chan to her parents' apartment where he sings "Everything Happens to Me" on their piano. They discuss their love for New York and agree that on rainy days it is one of the most romantic places. They visit theMetropolitan Museum of Art, where Chan confesses that she used to have a crush on Gatsby. A chance encounter with his aunt and uncle at the museum forces Gatsby to attend his parents' gala later that evening.
Meanwhile, while searching for a vanished Pollard, Ashleigh and Ted stumble upon Ted's wife, who is having an extramarital affair. While Ted confronts his wife, Ashleigh goes to the studio where she meets film star Francisco Vega, who invites her out for dinner. Gatsby, meanwhile, uses his gambling skills to win big at a poker game his brother had arranged earlier in the evening. Back at his hotel room, he sees Ashleigh on the television news hailed as Francisco's latest fling. Distraught, he goes for a drink at theCarlyle Hotel's cocktail lounge, where he meets an escort named Terry, whom he hires to impersonate the absent Ashleigh at his family's gala.
Francisco takes Ashleigh to a film business party, where she reconnects with Pollard and Ted, who both declare themselves smitten with her. Afterwards, Francisco and Ashleigh retire to his apartment, and as they are about to have sex, Francisco's girlfriend arrives unexpectedly, driving Ashleigh to leave through the backdoor into the rain, wearing only a raincoat over her bra and panties.
Gatsby arrives at his family's gala with Terry, but his mother sees through the charade. In an intimate talk, she reveals to Gatsby that she was an escort when she met his father, and that her earnings were the seed capital that resulted in their wealth. Her personal history is the reason she has pressured Gatsby into intellectual and artistic endeavors, education, and refinement that she acquired as an adult. This revelation changes Gatsby's perceptions of his mother in a positive way. At the end of the night, Ashleigh finds a despondent Gatsby back at the Carlyle, assuring him that nothing happened with Francisco, despite her lack of clothing.
The next morning, before their planned return to Yardley, the pair take a horse-drawn carriage ride inCentral Park. Ashleigh, however, is disappointed by the misty weather, and when Gatsby mentions aCole Porterlyric, she misattributes it toShakespeare. Realizing their incompatibility, Gatsby abruptly ends their relationship and announces that he will withdraw from Yardley to stay in New York. He later goes to theDelacorte Clock, outside theCentral Park Zoo, reenacting a fantasy he and Chan previously shared. As the clock strikes six, Chan arrives, and the pair kiss in the pouring rain.
In August 2017,Timothée Chalamet,Selena Gomez, andElle Fanningjoined the cast ofWoody Allen's newest film, with Allen directing from a screenplay he wrote.Letty Aronsonproduced, whileAmazon Studioswas to distribute it.[4][5]In September 2017,Jude Law,Diego Luna,Liev Schreiber,Annaleigh Ashford,Rebecca Hall,Cherry Jones, Will Rogers, andKelly Rohrbachjoined the cast.[6][7]In October 2017,Suki Waterhousejoined the cast,[8]and Allen confirmed the film was to be titledA Rainy Day in New York.[9]
Principal photography began on September 11, 2017, in New York City and concluded on October 23.[10][11]
The film features several songs by jazz pianistErroll Garner.[12]
A Rainy Day in New Yorkwas first released in Poland on July 26, 2019, byKino Świat.[13]It was subsequently released in Lithuania, Greece, Netherlands, Turkey, Belgium, France, Slovakia, Israel, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Germany, Brazil, South Korea, Russia, and Central and South America throughout the second half of 2019.[1][14][15][16][17][18]It was released in the United Kingdom on June 5, 2020.[19]It was released in the United States on October 9, 2020, byMPI Media Groupand Signature Entertainment.[20]
The film was the opening night premiere at theDeauville American Film Festivalon September 6, 2019, before opening theatrically in France on September 18.[21]
During the weekend of May 8–10, 2020, the film grossed over $330,000 in South Korea, becoming the highest-grossing film globally during that week. It had a disappointing opening weekend in the United States in October 2020, grossing $2,744 from six theaters, with an average of $457 per theater.[22]The film is set for a release in China in February 2022, becoming the first film by Allen to obtain a total theatrical release in the country.[23]It has earned approximately $23.8 million worldwide.[3]
The film completed post-production in the third quarter of 2018. Amazon shelved the project as being effectively unmarketable, and later dropped the film; thus, 2018 marked the first time since 1981 that an entire calendar year had gone by without a new Woody Allen film. In February 2019, Allen filed a $68 million lawsuit contesting that Amazon had failed to meet contractual obligations to release the film as contracted, alleging the studio had dropped the film for only "vague reasons" and terminated the four-picture contract over "a 25-year-old, baseless allegation". The legal action was seeking minimum guarantee payments for the four films, plus damages and legal fees.[24][25]In May 2019, it was reported that Amazon had given the U.S. distribution rights back to Allen.[26]In November 2019, Allen settled his breach of contract lawsuit against Amazon, and both parties voluntarily filed a joint notice dismissing the case.[27][28]The film eventually began streaming onAmazon Prime Videoin June 2021.[29]
The film's production coincided with the start of theMe Too movement, causing a resurgence in public interest in the1992 sexual abuse allegation against Allen. In October 2017, actor Griffin Newman announced viaTwitterthat he regretted acting in the film and would not work with Allen again in the future. Newman donated his salary to theRape, Abuse & Incest National Network(RAINN).[30][31]In January 2018, Chalamet donated his salary to the RAINN,Time's Up, and theLesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Centerof New York City.[32]Gomez made a donation of over $1 million, exceeding her salary, to Time's Up.[33]Like Gomez, Hall donated her salary to Time's Up.[34]She later explained, "I've been deliberate in saying that the choice wasn't making a judgment one way or another. I don't believe anyone in the public should be judge and jury on a case that is so complex."[35]
Without commenting on the allegations against Allen, Law said in November 2018 that it's "a terrible shame" the film got shelved.[36]Cherry Jones, conversely, defended Allen in April 2019, saying: "[...] I went back and studied every scrap of information I could get about that period. And in my heart of hearts, I do not believe he was guilty as charged [...] [t]here are those who are comfortable with their certainty. I am not. I don't know the truth, but I know that if we condemn by instinct,democracyis on aslippery slope."[37]
The Hollywood ReporterandScreen Rantnoted critics' negative reaction and praise for Chalamet's performance, and their belief that the film contains derivative ideas from Allen's previous films.[23][38]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 47% based on 113 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Its outstanding cast helps elevate a middling screenplay, butA Rainy Day in New Yorkfalls well short of Woody Allen's best efforts."[39]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[40]
Variety'sJessica Kiang wrote: "Despite featuring some of the best actors of their respective generations,A Rainy Day in New Yorkfeels like a film born of profound creative exhaustion."[41]Matt Thrift ofLittle White Lieswas more positive, calling the film "hardly top-tier Allen" but had "such wonderful performances" from the cast.[42]Lisa Nesselson forScreen Dailypraised the "splendid performances" andVittorio Storaro's brilliant cinematography, and noted that the film is "far more hit than miss".[43]Jordan Mintzer ofThe Hollywood Reportersuggested that "A Rainy Dayhas its moments, most of them thanks to star Timothée Chalamet [...] who does a terrific job channeling your typical Allenian antihero," and "Fanning does her best with such a problematic character", but concluded that the film is merely Allen's watchable rehashed themes.[44]Jade Budowski ofDeciderpanned the film for its unlikable characters and its "painfully pretentious and on-the-nose" dialogue, before concluding by advising readers to skip the film: "The allegations against Allen alone should be enough reason to avoidA Rainy Day in New York, but even without them, it is a barely watchable affair."[45]

Isaac Liev Schreiber was born on October 4, 1967, inSan Francisco,California,[1]the son of Heather Milgram,[2]a painter, and Tell Schreiber, an actor and carpenter.[3][4]His father wasProtestantand his mother isJewish.[5][6][7]His maternal grandfather, Alex Milgram, emigrated fromUkraine. Milgram, who was the most significant male in Schreiber's youth, played thecelloand ownedPierre-Auguste Renoiretchings, and made his living by delivering meat to restaurants.[8][9][10][11]His mother, who is an aficionada ofclassical musicandRussian literature, has said that she named Live after her favorite Russian author,Leo Tolstoy, while his father has stated that Schreiber was named after the doctor who saved his mother's life. His family nickname, adopted when Schreiber was a baby, is "Huggy".[12][8]
When Schreiber was one year old, his family moved to theunincorporated rural communityofWinlaw, in the southern interior ofBritish Columbia.[13]Over the next four years, his mother was hospitalized on several occasions and underwent therapy related to a bad experience onLSDthat she had near the beginning of her marriage (in San Francisco), according to Schreiber's father.[8]After Schreiber's father threatened to have Schreiber's mother admitted to amental institution, Schreiber was kidnapped by his mother, eventually leading to his mother gaining full custody of him.[14]Theysquattedon theLower East Sidein New York City.[15]
Schreiber has described his mother as a "far-outSocialist Labor Partyhippiebohemianfreakwho hung out withWilliam Burroughs".[8][16][17]She was "a highly cultured eccentric" who earned a living by splitting her time between driving a cab and creatingpapier-mâchépuppets." In 1983, his mother bought him amotorcycleon his 16th birthday to "promote fearlessness."[8]The criticJohn Lahrwrote in a 1999New Yorkerprofile that, "To a large extent, Schreiber's professional shape-shifting and his uncanny instinct for isolating the frightened, frail, goofy parts of his characters are a result of being forced to adapt to his mother's eccentricities. It's both his grief and his gift."[8]
Her bohemian proclivities led to actions such as making Schreiber take the Hindu name Shiva Das, wear yoga shirts, consume a vegetarian diet, and briefly attendSatchidanandaAshraminPomfret, Connecticut, when he was 12.[18]Schreiber's mother also forbade her son from seeing color films. As a result, his favorite actors wereCharlie Chaplin, Andrew Cartwright, andBasil Rathbone. In retrospect, Schreiber said in a 2008 interview that he appreciates his mother's influences, saying: "Since I've had Sasha, I've completely identified with everything my mother went through raising me ... and I think her choices were inspired."[19]
Subsequently, Schreiber attendedFriends Seminary, a Quaker school.[20]In high school, Liev played thebass clarinet.[21][22]
Schreiber went on to attendHampshire CollegeinAmherst, Massachusetts, where he began his acting training at theUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst, through theFive Collegesconsortium.

The following year he made hisBroadwaydebut as Eliot in theJane BowlesplayIn the Summer House(1994) acting oppositeFrances Conroy.[25]That same year he made his feature film debut as Chris, a depressedtrans womanin theNora Ephrondirected dark comedy filmMixed Nuts(1994) starringSteve Martin. In 1995 he had supporting roles in the independent filmsMad LoveandParty Girl. His first leading film roles in theGreg Mottolacomedy-dramaThe DaytrippersandNicole Holofcener'sWalking and Talkingwere both released in 1996. Following Schreiber's string of supporting roles in various independent films, his big break came when he played the accused murdererCotton Wearyin theScreamtrilogy of horror films. Though the success of theScreamtrilogy led Schreiber to roles in several big-budget studio pictures,Entertainment Weeklywrote in 2007 that "Schreiber is [still] best known for such indie gems asWalking and Talking,The Daytrippers, andBig Night."[26]
AfterScream,Schreiber was cast asOrson Wellesin theHBOfilmRKO 281(1999). Laura Fries ofVarietywrote of his performance, "Schreiber, as Welles, manages to capture the essence of a man of many passions, and creates a nice balance of hubris and self-loathing to give the part real depth".[27]He earned nominations for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or MovieandGolden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film. He then played supporting roles in several studio films, includingRon Howard's 1996 remake ofRansom, the 1999 filmThe Hurricane,A Walk on the Moon(1999), the 2000 film adaptation ofHamletstarringEthan Hawke, and as a spy inThe Sum of All Fears(2002) acting oppositeBen AffleckandMorgan Freeman.

In 2000, he went on to playLaertesin the filmHamlet, a modern adaptation of the play.[36]His performance in the title role ofHenry Vin a 2003 Central Park production of that play causedThe New Yorkermagazine critic John Lahr to expound upon his aptitude for playing Shakespeare characters. "He has a swiftness of mind," Lahr wrote, "which convinces the audience that language is being coined in the moment. His speech, unlike that of the merely adequate supporting cast, feels lived rather than learned."[37]
Schreiber toldThe New Yorkerin 1999, "I don't know that I want to be an actor for the rest of my life."

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
