The Last Thing He Wantedis a 2020political thrillerfilm directed byDee Rees, based on the 1996novel of the same namebyJoan Didion, from a screenplay by Rees and Marco Villalobos. The film starsAnne Hathaway,Ben Affleck,Rosie Perez,Edi Gathegi,Mel Rodriguez,Toby Jones, andWillem Dafoe.
The Last Thing He Wantedhad its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 27, 2020, and was released on February 21, 2020, byNetflix. The film was panned by critics, who criticized the writing.
Elena McMahon is a journalist reporting out of theAtlantic Post's Central American bureau in El Salvador who is forced to flee during thecivil war. A few years later she is pushing to reopen the bureau, but her editor reveals that Congress is secretly pressuring the paper to dial back their coverage of Central and South American affairs, so reopening the bureau is not an option. Instead, he reassigns Elena to coverRonald Reagan'sre-election campaign.
Elena reluctantly agrees to meet with her absentee father, Dick. She realises he is still involved in trafficking illegal contraband, but also that he is suffering from dementia.
Elena embarks on Reagan's campaign trail. In Cincinnati, she uses her acquaintance with Helena Shultz to get a seat at her husband, Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz's table during Helena's birthday party. Elena attempts to question him but he stonewalls her until a staffer intervenes.
In Houston, Elena meets with General Gus Sharp who had previously identified American shell casings in El Salvador as coming from a stockpile in Missouri. She shows him surveillance photos of shipping containers, which Sharp identifies as surplus arms from various National Guard units, including the20th Special Forces.
Elena receives a call that Dick has been hospitalized. She hands off her assignment to her friend Alma and goes to Florida to take care of him. He begs her to meet his business associate, Barry Sedlow, for an important deal that he has set up. Elena reluctantly agrees to meet Sedlow, allowing her to investigate the story from the inside.
Sedlow gives Elena specific instructions for how to deliver a large arms shipment to Costa Rica. She is to be paid intraveler's checks, but upon arriving the buyer, Jones, shorts her, also paying in cocaine. When the cargo pilot she flew in with leaves without her, Jones drives her toSan José. She seizes the opportunity to take his gun and vehicle, driving herself the rest of the way.
When leaving Costa Rica, Elena discovers the passport she was given has the name Elise Meyer. She manages to depart, narrowly avoiding trouble when her cab driver is stopped by security with her bag containing the cocaine and gun; it has her father's name on it, so the cab driver is arrested.
Secretary Shultz meets withAmbassador-at-LargeTreat Morrison, who has been looking into Elena's background since her original encounter with Shultz.
Elena ends up inAntigua, where she learns that her father has passed away. She attempts to enter the American embassy to get a valid passport, but it is the 4th of July, and nobody is available. Dejected, she returns to her hotel, where Morrison arrives, who hides his true agenda. After some mild verbal sparring, Elena sleeps with him. Confessing who her father is, she explains what she has been doing for him in Central America. Elena believes that her focus on this story was motivated by her fear of losing her connection to her daughter Cat. The teen is enrolled in a boarding school, and fears her work will be all she has left.
The next day, Elena is by the hotel pool when Jones arrives and rescues her from an attack by gunmen. He escorts her to safety and explains to her that the deal her father was offered was fake, meant to lure Dick out of hiding. Morrison puts her in touch with Paul Schuster, who gives her a place to stay while things get sorted out. After several days at Paul's, Morrison reaches out and lays out a plan to get her home, where she can break the story on the arms deals. The next day, a shooter arrives at Paul's, killing him and his staff before calling out to Elena. She turns around to see Morrison, who fatally shoots her.
Morrison gives official testimony claiming he shot Elena in self-defense. Meanwhile, Jones issues an official report to his superiors in French Intelligence revealing he had been trying to protect her. Finally, Alma uses all of the notes and information gathered by Elena to posthumously publish the story of theIran–Contra affair.
Joan Didion's 1996 novelThe Last Thing He Wantedwas optioned by the producerCassian Elwesin 2016. In September 2017, it was announcedDee Rees, who had previously worked with Elwes on the 2017 filmMudbound, would direct. Elwes produced the film, under his Elevated Films banner, with financing by Fyzz Facility.[1]The film was executive produced by Jamin O'Brien, Wayne Godfrey, and Robert Jones.[2]
The first draft of the script forThe Last Thing He Wantedwas written by Marco Villalobos, with Rees writing the second draft. She described the script as a difficult adaptation, as the novel is internally focused and told by an anonymous narrator. Rees was drawn to the character of Elena and her contradictory actions throughout the novel; she wanted to retain Didion's prose but with "more connectivity, because in the book there’s no reason why Elena goes or why she stays".[3]The storyline differs from Didion's novel, with the addition of the character of Alma and the increased role of Jones; in the latter case, Rees intended this theme of Elena refusing to trust Jones despite him repeatedly saving her to serve as a commentary on race that was absent from Didion's novel. This allowed Rees to explore Elena's false confidence and for the audience to "question the idea of heroism, in the big scale we're looking at American imperialism and then Treat in micro is kind of a personification of that idea, in that he is the system".[4]
Many of the changes from the original plot have been criticized by reviewers, including the addition of the scene where Schultz and Morrison discuss the assassination plot.[5]Villalobos and Rees' choice to retain direct quotes from the novel – which come from the unnamed narrator who was cut in the film adaptation – was criticized in a review by theAssociated Pressas retaining the sense of detachment employed in the novel by Didion without explanation. The same review commented on the choice to portray the fiction story with no explanation of theSandinistasandContras, but to introduce the character of the real Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz.[6]
In February 2018,Anne Hathawayjoined the cast of the film.[7]In June 2018,Willem Dafoejoined the cast of the film.[8]In July 2018,Ben Affleck,Toby Jones,Rosie Perez,Edi Gathegi,Mel RodriguezandCarlos Lealjoined the cast of the film.[9][10]Rees later described the casting of Affleck as important to her focus on Elena trusting the white Morrison over the black Jones; she said in an interview with theLos Angeles Timesthat Affleck and "all the baggage he brings" brought an important racial awareness to the film.[4]
The film, with a budget of $100 million,[11]beganprincipal photographyin June 2018 inPuerto Rico.[12]Background extras were scouted for filming in Miami, Florida.[13]
The Last Thing He Wantedwas filmed by cinematographer Bobby Bukowski. Rees worked with Bukowski to use the camera to capture the pace of Didion's prose, with a stream-of-consciousness speed. She was particularly focused on the opening of the film, which maintains a momentum of blocking under a narration of the novel's opening passage.[3][4]Rees was inspired by the filmsThe Parallax View,SalvadorandNetwork, with a focus on pacing and realism.[3]In one early scene, Hathaway and Perez run for an airplane as the camera moves away from them, through the airport and out to the tarmac as they make it aboard the flight. This approach creates "isolation and uncertainty in nearly every frame of the movie".[4]
In May 2018,Netflixacquired the distribution rights forThe Last Thing He Wantedafter the film was offered to potential buyers byBloom Mediaat the 2018Berlin International Film Festival.[14][2]It had its world premiere at theSundance Film Festivalon January 27, 2020.[15][16]The film received a limited theatrical release on February 14, 2020, and was released on Netflix on February 21.[3]
On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 5% of 56 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.2/10. The website's consensus reads: "It'll be the last thing most viewers want, too."[17]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 35 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.[18]Rees, in an interview withEntertainment Weekly, commented simply that "Everybody hated it".[19]
Nick Allen, a critic forRogerEbert.com, called the film "incomprehensible to an almost impressive degree [...] A true Netflix Original Film paradox – not even a pause and rewind button at the ready will help it make much sense." The film was described as suffering from an overload of information, too much backstory paired with choppy editing. Hathaway's acting was praised by Allen, with Affleck and Dafoe described as "professionals on autopilot" and Perez and Gathegi not given a role beyond story devices.[20]A review inTimesimilarly praised Hathaway for "playing stressed-out and obsessive".[21]
Benjamin Lee ofThe Guardianwrote, "a two-hour film packed with too much and somehow not enough,The Last Thing He Wantedis a thing that no one wanted."[22]A similar review in theAssociated Pressargued that the film is "both too small and too large, unable to tell the whole story of the U.S. meddling in Central America and yet unable to really tell the story of one woman, either."[6]

She has also receivedPrimetime Emmy Awardnominations forOutstanding WritingandOutstanding Directing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie, and won theDirectors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Miniseries or TV FilmforBessie.
Reeds received aUnited States ArtistsFellowship in 2011.[5]
Rees was born in 1977 inNashville, Tennessee. Her father was a police officer[6]and her mother was a scientist atVanderbilt University.[7]Rees attended local schools and college atFlorida A&M University. After graduating from business school, Rees held an array of jobs, including working as a salesperson for panty-liners, a vendor for wart-remover and bunion pads,[8]and also worked in marketing and brand management.[9]While working forDr. Scholl's, Rees worked on set for a commercial and she realized she enjoyed the creation of film content. This led her to pursue film school.[8]For graduate school, she attendedNew York University'sTisch School of the Arts. While atNew York Universityfor film,Spike Leewas her professor and mentor.[8]Dee Rees went on to work underSpike Leeon his filmsInside Man(2006) andWhen the Levees Broke(2006). During this time, she worked on a script for what would later be the feature filmPariah. For her graduate thesis, she adapted the first act of the script and directed it as a short film of the same name. In 2007, the short played at 40 film festivals around the world, winning numerous accolades, including the Audience Award at theLos Angeles Film Festival.[10]
Rees' first full-length film was a documentary,Eventual Salvation(2009), which aired on the Sundance Channel. The film follows her American-born, 80-year-old grandmother, Amma, as she returns toMonrovia, Liberiato rebuild her home and community. She had barely escaped the devastating Liberian Civil War only a decade earlier.
Rees completed development and filming of her debut feature film,Pariah, which she has described as semi-autobiographical. In graduate school Rees interned for Spike Lee, whom she got to executive produce the film.[11]It premiered at the2011 Sundance Film Festival.[12]Lisa Schwartzman ofEntertainment Weeklywrote, "In her fearless, world-here-I-am! debutPariah, writer-director Dee Rees demonstrates, with simplicity and verve, that there's no substitute for authenticity".[13]Pariahexplores the complexities of religion, politics and socioeconomic class within and surrounding a Black family.[14]The short film version ofPariahwas initially a thesis project done by Dee Rees in film school.[15]It was difficult to receive funding for the feature film, and the process took about five years to reach completion.[15]The format and content changed significantly from the short film to the feature film.[16]The transition from short film to feature film meant it needed to be more accessible for a wider audience in order to make money.[16]This accessibility reached new audiences and sparked new conversations that were focused on blackness and sexuality in a new way.[16]
At the timePariah(2011) was released, the film was one of the very few films that follow the journey of a young person of color as they come to terms with their sexuality and come out to their friends and families.[14]In 2011, she won many awards forPariah,including the John Cassavetes Award at the Independent Spirit Awards, theGotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Director, the Outstanding Independent Motion Picture Award at the NAACP Image Awards, and the Outstanding Film –Limited Release Award at the GLAAD Media Award in 2012.[17]
Pariahhas been compared to the written work ofAudre Lorde, specificallyZami: a New Spelling of My Name.[14]Both forms provide a different take on the lived experiences of young Black lesbian women in a way that gives the characters depth and power. Both stories of identity, they are not only diversifying the characters audiences enjoy in media, but also providing an authentic expression of these lives.[14]
In 2015, Rees' filmBessiepremiered onHBO, starringQueen Latifahas the iconic singerBessie Smith.[18]The film was well received by critics.[19]
It also won fourPrimetime Emmy Awards, including thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie. Rees was nominated forOutstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic SpecialandOutstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special.
Together with Virgil Williams, Rees wroteMudbound, a period drama adapted from the 2008 novel of the same name by Hillary Jordan. Rees also directed the film, starringCarey Mulligan,Garrett Hedlund,Jason Clarke,Jason Mitchell, andMary J. Blige. After being shown atSundancein 2017,Mudboundbecame the highest purchase of the festival, being bought for $12.5 million byNetflix.[8]Mudboundwas shot in New Orleans over 28 days in the summer of 2016.[20]The film tells the story of two families in the Mississippi Delta in the 1940s. The McAllan family is white and their neighbors, the Jacksons, are black.[20]The Jacksons are sharecroppers who have a connection to the land, while the McAllans are a middle-class family that own a large plot of land in Mississippi.[21]Mudboundtells a story of racism and race relations that continue to be played out today. The movie explores whiteness and the privilege associated with it, while comparing and contrasting the experiences of white and Black people of the period.[8]This work contains many personal connections for Rees, such as her grandfather's experiences in the army and her grandmother's aspiration to be a stenographer.[8]Rees used her grandmother's journal to help guide her process. It contained family photographs of their slave ancestors, with the names of who fought in wars. Rees says that by using this it was a way of interrogating her own personal history. She used written text from the journal, a war ration book, and a photograph of her great grandmother, and each one was an inspiration for something inMudbound.[21]
Rees and Williams were nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Adapted ScreenplayforMudbound, which made Rees the first African-American woman ever to be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as the first African-American woman to be nominated for a writing Oscar sinceSuzanne de Passewas nominated forBest Original Screenplayfor the 1972 filmLady Sings the Blues.[22][23]The nomination ofMary J. Bligefor theAcademy Award for Best Supporting ActressforMudboundmade Rees the first African-American woman to direct a film for which an actor or actress was nominated for an Academy Award.[24][25]
A lesser-known project of Rees' is the showPhilip K. Dick's Electric Dreams,where Rees was given the chance to engage with the many emotions looming around the election of Donald Trump, and manipulate them within a sci-fi context, which is now streaming onAmazon Prime.[26]
Rees is also attached to write and directAn Uncivil WarforFilmNation.[27]In 2018, Rees was nominated for NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Writing.[28]

Rees is currently set to write and directMGM's feature film adaptation ofGeorge Gershwin'sPorgy and Bess.[33]She will be working alongside the film's producers,Irwin Winkler[33]andCharles Winkler.[33]
In 2019, Rees began work as writer and director for her upcoming film,The Kyd's Exquisite Follies.[34]An original script, the film is a musical fantasy about a young musician in search of stardom.[34]Rees is working alongside producerCassian Elwes,[34]with singer-songwriterSantigold[34]set to compose.
In June 2021, Dee Rees was announced as the first African-American woman to direct aCriterionfilm.[35]With the addition of her breakout film, Pariah (2011),Criterionhas acknowledged its need for the addition of more female directors and director of color, and has vowed to bring more diversity to light.[35]
Rees has said that she was inspired by the realistic directorial style ofCassavetes,[36]and the cinematographerBradford Young's organic style on the television showFriday Night Lights.[36]
As with Rees's first breakout feature,Pariah(2011), Dee Rees pulls much of her directorial influence from her own life.[7]Rees also cites her own life experiences in the protagonist of her newest project,The Kyd's Exquisite Follies.[7]As a Black lesbian filmmaker, Rees's intersectional identity is a huge part of her and is also unique in Hollywood. Rees has said that her dissimilarity from much of Hollywood has only amplified the importance of translating her experience into her films.[7]
Rees's sexuality makes an appearance in her films, such as her 2011 filmPariah(2011), which tells the story of a teenage Black girl navigating the exploration of her sexuality.[10]HBO'sBessie(2015), also written and directed by Rees, explores the sexual identity of blues singerBessie Smith.[1]Rees also described the protagonist of her latest project,The Kyd's Exquisite Folliesas androgynous,[7]again connecting her own experience of sexuality to her filmmaking.
Rees's identity as a Black woman is also very prevalent in her films, as Black women are extremely central in her films, such asPariah(2011),Mudbound(2017),Bessie(2015), and a few of her upcoming projects.
Still early in her career, Rees has shown a large array of stylistic choices in her films in her exploration for her identity as a filmmaker. However, Rees has been said to spend hours on shots that end up only being a few seconds, focusing intently on visual details.[7]
Spike Leewas Rees's mentor throughout her time atNYU Tisch, and the two worked on films together such asInside Man(2006) andWhen The Levees Broke(2006).Leealso worked as a producer on Rees's breakout film,Pariah(2011).
Cassian Elwes, producer ofMudbound(2017), has worked with Rees on multiple projects, such asThe Last Thing He Wanted(2020) and Rees's upcoming project,The Kyd's Exquisite Follies.
Lisa Cortésdirected and produced the 2023 documentary filmLittle Richard: I am Everything, with Rees serving as an executive producer.[37]
Rees is alesbian, and she describedPariahas semi-autobiographical.[38]On National Coming Out Day in 2011, in an interview with BlackEnterprise.com, Rees discussed her coming out experience. When she came out her parents weren't accepting. They sent her emails, cards, letters and Bible verses. Rees seesPariahas semi-autobiographical because she can relate to the main concepts of the film.[39]
Since at least 2017, Rees has been in a relationship with poet and writerSarah M. Broom.[40]They are now married and currently reside inHarlem.[7]
Rees, who is of African American descent, incorporates her family's history, specifically her own grandmother's, in her 2017 filmMudboundwhere American violence and racism are more relevant to the lives of all citizens and a marker of each individual's identity.[41]

He always wants to know a character's needs, and what's beneath those needs. Then he takes all that material and somehow embeds it into the character and physically inhabits the character, so that you never think he's playing the character. It's fascinating to watch him close up. He carries the emotional complexities in every tiny gesture that his character makes so that you immediately can see what his character is like. A character like Roger is full of contradictions, a city banker with an air of entitlement but also a little insecurity picking away at him. Toby can portray that in his walk alone. That's what's great about him, he can portray cold he can portray warm and he can portray both of those things at once."[14]

You just frame them, give them circumstances, and that character will happen."[24]Principal photography for the film took place in thePhilippinesand required Dafoe to undergoboot camp training.[25]Los Angeles TimeswriterSheila Bensonpraised his performance and found it to be "particularly fine" to see Dafoe play "something other than a psychopath".[26]At the59th Academy Awards, Dafoe was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[27]Dafoe provided his voice to the documentaryDear America: Letters Home from Vietnam(1987) and, in 1988, Dafoe starred in another film set during the Vietnam War, this time as Buck McGriff in the action thrillerOff Limits.[28][29]His second release of 1988 wasMartin Scorsese's epic dramaThe Last Temptation of Christ, in which Dafoe portrayed Jesus.

Dafoe next starred in the erotic thrillerBody of Evidence(1993) withMadonna. The story concerns a lawyer, played by Dafoe, who engages in a sexual relationship with the woman he is representing in a murder case.

The film was met with a mixed reception from critics, althoughCaryn JamesofThe New York Timesfelt that Dafoe's "stunningly sharp, sympathetic portrait raises the film above a script that is full of serious holes and stilted dialogue".[49]In 1995, he played an 18th-century writer in the period dramaThe Night and the Moment.[50]
In his first of three film appearances in 1996, Dafoe made a cameo appearance as an electrician in the biographical dramaBasquiat.[51]Next, he played an operative in the romantic war dramaThe English Patient.The English Patientwas filmed inTuscany, where Dafoe said he particularly enjoyed the "quiet moments in the monastery between shoots".[52]In the period dramaVictory—which was filmed in 1994 and premiered in Europe in 1996, but was not released until 1998—Dafoe played a European living on an island in the Southeast Asia who becomes the target of redemption after preventing a woman, played byIrène Jacob, from being raped.[53]
"I really made a conscious effort to mix it up, not because in itself it's not the job of an actor to do all different things, but for me that's what I'm interested in. You've got to be careful because you've got to work with what you have, not just for vanity's sake, but I think the best part of being an actor sometimes is the opportunity to transform yourself superficially, and deeply."
In 1997, Dafoe returned to playing a villainous role in the action thrillerSpeed 2: Cruise Control, expressing the necessity of appearing in both independent andblockbusterfilms.[55]The film starredSandra BullockandJason Patricas a couple vacationing on a luxury cruise that has been hijacked by Dafoe's character, Geiger, a hacker that has programmed the ship to crash into an oil tanker.Speed 2was met with negative reviews from critics,[56]with Dafoe himself receiving aRazzie Awardnomination forWorst Supporting Actor.[57]For his next film,Affliction(1997), Dafoe worked with Paul Schrader for a second time, playing the brother ofNick Nolte's character and served as the film's narrator.[58]Also in 1997, Dafoe took on a voice acting role in an episode of the animated sitcomThe Simpsonstitled "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", voicing the commandant of a military academy thatBartandLisa Simpsonare attending.[59]Following a villainous supporting role in the romantic mystery dramaLulu on the Bridge,[60]Dafoe starred alongsideChristopher WalkenandAsia ArgentoinAbel Ferrara'scyberpunkdramaNew Rose Hotelin 1998. It follows X (Dafoe) and Fox (Walken), a pair of corporate raiders attempting to lure a Japanese scientist from one megacorporation to another.

In 1999, Dafoe gave a supporting performance inDavid Cronenberg'sExistenz, a science fiction thriller in which he played a gas station owner named Gas.[63]Later in the year, Dafoe starred in the action filmThe Boondock Saints. He played an eccentric, gay FBI agent assigned with investigating a series of murders committed by the MacManus twins (played bySean Patrick FlaneryandNorman Reedus) who are acting as vigilantes after an act of self-defense.The Boondock Saintswas negatively received by film critics, largely for its extreme violence and lack of emotional depth, though some critics praised Dafoe's role in the film.[64][65]The film performed poorly at the box office, but has since been branded as being acult film.[66]
In his first film of the 2000s, Dafoe was featured in a supporting role inAmerican Psycho(2000) as a private investigator investigating the disappearance of a co-worker ofPatrick Bateman(played byChristian Bale), an investment banker who leads a double life as a serial killer.[67]He then acted inSteve Buscemi's crime dramaAnimal Factory, starring as an incarcerated veteran con-man who takes a young inmate (played byEdward Furlong) under his wing and introduces to him to his gang.

The film delves into fiction when, over the course ofNosferatu's production, the cast and crew come to discover that Schreck is actually a vampire himself. Much of the film's critical praise went to Dafoe; Roger Ebert wrote that Dafoe "embodies the Schreck ofNosferatuso uncannily that when real scenes from the silent classic are slipped into the frame, we don't notice a difference".[69]TheChicago ReadercriticJonathan Rosenbaumfelt the film's "only redeeming quality" was Dafoe's "enjoyably over-the-top, eye-rolling performance".[70]Dafoe received numerous awards and nominations for his performance, including his secondAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actornomination.[71]Dafoe took on two leading roles in 2001, both of which were as priests. In the dramaPavilion of Women, he played an American priest living in China who falls in love with a local married woman (played by the film's screenwriterLuo Yan) while giving her son a Western education.[72]He starred oppositeHaley Joel OsmentinEdges of the Lord, playing a compassionate priest helping a young Jewish boy pose as aCatholicto protect him during Nazi Germany's occupation of Poland.[73]

Osborn is a family friend of Spider-Man's secret identityPeter Parkeras Osborn's son,Harry Osborn(played byJames Franco), is a close friend of Parker. The role required Dafoe to wear an uncomfortable costume and mask that made it impossible to emote using his face, confining Dafoe to convey emotion through his voice and head movements. Dafoe also had to wear a prosthetic teeth for his part as Norman whereas the hallucinations of the character had Dafoe in his natural teeth.[74]Dafoe's role in the film was generally well-received, including aNew York Daily Newsreviewer who felt he put "the scare in archvillain" andPeter BradshawofThe Guardianwho deemed him "strong support".[75][76]Conversely, criticA. O. Scottwrote that his performance was "uninspired and secondhand".[77]IGN'sRichard George commented that Green Goblin's armor, particularly the helmet, was "almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression".[78]Steven Scaife atVicewrote that Dafoe's Goblin "represents everything that's fun about superhero villains, as well as everything that's great about Raimi's campy films", also commending Dafoe's voice and body language, which helped overcome the bulky Green Goblin costume that he compared to that of aPower Rangersvillain.[79]
Later in 2002, Dafoe starred withGreg Kinnearin Paul Schrader's biographical filmAuto Focus, Dafoe's third collaboration with Schrader.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
