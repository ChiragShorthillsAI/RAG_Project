A Greyhound bus filled with variations ofGloria Steinemof all ages drives along the road. The Glorias begin to reminisce about the past. As a young child, Gloria is charmed by her father, an antique salesman whose 'make do' attitude aggravates her mother. A few years later, her parents are separated and a young Gloria is forced to be her mother's caretaker as she falls into a deep depression. To her surprise she finds various articles written with a male byline that her mother reveals were written by her before she was married.
As a young woman, Gloria travels to India on a fellowship. Returning to America she seeks out jobs as a journalist and, despite casual sexism and harassment, manages to succeed writing articles on fashion and dating. After writing an exposé on the poor working conditions of the waitresses working at thePlayboy Club, Steinem's name is made. However she feels ashamed by the continued degradation of her work and turns down an offer to turn her article into a book.
Shortly after, Gloria's father is injured in a car accident. Arriving to see him a week after the accident she learns he has died and feels immense guilt that she delayed her visitation out of fear she would have to become his caretaker as she once was for her mother.
While attending theMarch on Washingtonto write a profile of James Baldwin, her discussions with a black woman open her mind to the prejudice faced by black women in America and to her own complicity as a white woman. She later attends a speak out on illegal abortion event that causes her to reflect on her own abortion which she had shortly before her fellowship. Moved by the stories of other women and knowing that magazines will not allow her to write the stories she wants, Gloria moves towards activism and befriendsDorothy Pitman HughesandFlorynce Kennedy, two black women who teach her about public speaking and activism.
In the early 1970s, Gloria and her friends publish their magazineMs.in order to finally be able to talk about subjects they want. In the first issue, Gloria, along with 52 other famous women, publicly admits to having had an illegal abortion.
Gloria begins to move further into politics by campaigning forBella Abzug. At theNational Women's Political Caucus, Gloria and other women in various movements fight to establish theEqual Rights Amendment. The amendment ultimately fails.
Gloria continues to advocate, speak, and campaign despite being continually plagued by opposition to her pro-choice stance and questions about her marital status and lack of children. At the age of 66, she marries for the first time only to become widowed shortly after.
In 2016, she writes an article about the devastating effect ofHillary Clinton's loss during the2016 United States presidential election. It is then revealed that the Greyhound bus is filled with protestors headed to the2017 Women's Marchwith the real-life Gloria Steinem on board.

Ruhl gained widespread recognition for her playThe Clean House(2004). "The play takes place in a 'metaphysical Connecticut' where married doctors employ a Brazilian housekeeper who is more interested in coming up with the perfect joke than in cleaning.  Trouble erupts when the husband falls in love with one of his cancer patients".[36]It won theSusan Smith Blackburn Prizein 2004 and was aPulitzer Prizefinalist in 2005.[37]

The play explores the use and understanding of language, an interest which she shared with her father:[8]
Each Saturday, from the time Ruhl was five, Patrick took his daughters to the Walker Brothers Original Pancake House for breakfast and taught them a new word, along with its etymology.  (The language lesson and some of Patrick's words—"ostracize," "peripatetic," "defunct"—are memorialized in the 2003Eurydice, a retelling of the Orpheus myth from his inamorata's point of view, in which the dead Father, reunited with his daughter, tries to re-teach her lost vocabulary.)[8]
Eurydiceis Ruhl's version of the classic Eurydice and Orpheus tale.[38]It portrays anAlice in Wonderland-esque underworld, complete with talking stones and a Lord of the Underworld, who can be seen riding a red tricycle.[40]In keeping with the play's Greek origins, the Stones serve as a new take on a Greek chorus. The Stones comment on the action and warn the characters, but cannot intervene in any of the events.  The play explores relationships, love, communication, and the permeability between the world of the living and the world of the dead, in a quest to discover where true meaning lies in life and thereafter.[38]
In 2020, Ruhl adapted the play as a libretto for anew operacomposed byMatthew Aucoin. It premiered at theLos Angeles Operaon February 1, 2020.[41]and at theMetropolitan Operaon November 23, 2021.

Goldbergand Arena's Molly Smith commissioned the third act.[43]Passion Playmade its New York City premiere in Spring 2010 in a production by the Epic Theatre Ensemble at the Irondale Center inBrooklyn.[44]Each part of the trilogy depicts the staging of a Passion Play at a different place and during a different historical period: Elizabethan England, Nazi Germany, and the United States from the time of the Vietnam War until the present.[7]

The play received a UK premiere atThe Arches (Glasgow)in June 2011.  The play explores technology and the disconnect people are experiencing in the digital age:
"Cell phones, iPods, wireless computers will change people in ways we don't even understand," Ruhl stated. "We're less connected to the present. No one is where they are. There's absolutely no reason to talk to a stranger anymore—you connect to people you already know. But how well do you know them? Because you never see them—you just talk to them. I find that terrifying."[8]
In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play)premiered atBerkeley Repin February 2009.[47][48]The play opened onBroadwayat theLyceum Theatrewith previews starting on October 22, 2009 and an official opening in November 2009. This marked Ruhl's Broadway debut.[49]The play explores the history of the vibrator, developed for use as a treatment for women diagnosed with hysteria.In the Next Roomwas a finalist for the 2010Pulitzer Prize for Drama[37]and was nominated for the 2010 Tony Award for Best Play, Best Featured Actress, and Best Costume.[50]
Ruhl explains,
One physician quoted in the book [The Technology of the Orgasm] argued that at least three-fourths of women had ailments that could be cured by the vibrator. Which is kind of stunning. The economy for vibrators, even then, was vast; I mean, it was a million-dollar enterprise.[43]
The play then moved toSydney, Australia and premiered for theSydney Theatre CompanywithJacqueline McKenziein the title role. The production was directed byPamela Rabe.[51]
In September 2006, she received aMacArthur Fellowship. The announcement of that award stated: "Sarah Ruhl, 32, playwright, New York City. Playwright creating vivid and adventurous theatrical works that poignantly juxtapose the mundane aspects of daily life with mythic themes of love and war."[52][53]
John Lahr, inThe New Yorker, wrote of Ruhl:
But if Ruhl's demeanor is unassuming, her plays are bold. Her nonlinear form of realism—full of astonishments, surprises, and mysteries—is low on exposition and psychology. "I try to interpret how people subjectively experience life," she has said. "Everyone has a great, horrible opera inside him. I feel that my plays, in a way, are very old-fashioned. They're pre-Freudian in the sense that the Greeks and Shakespeare worked with similar assumptions. Catharsis isn't a wound being excavated from childhood."[8]
In a discussion with Paula Vogel forBOMB Magazine, Ruhl described the psychology of her plays as "putting things up againstFreud... it's a moremedievalsensibility of the humors,melancholia, blackbile, and transformation." Rather than "connect the dots psychologically in a linear way," Ruhl prefers to create emotional psychological states through transformation of the performance space.[43]
In 2005, Ruhl married child psychiatrist Tony Charuvastra. He taught a course at NYU on marriage and divorce and sometimes includedIn the Next Roomon his syllabus.[8]Ruhl and Charuvastra have three children: Anna and twins William and Hope.[54]
Because ofBell's palsy, contracted after she gave birth to the twins, one side of her face is paralyzed.  She wrote about her experience in her bookSmile: The Story of a Face, a nonfiction memoir.[55]
Ruhl was awarded the Residency 1 program by theSignature Theatre Companyin 2019. This involves "a year-long intensive, exploration of a writer's body of work."[56]
In 2006, Ruhl received aMacArthur Foundation Fellowshipwith a cash award of $500,000. Ruhl commented: "...the money is truly astounding. The whole thing really does leave one speechless."[57]
Ruhl has been awarded the Steinberg Distinguished  Playwright Award for 2016; the awardee is given a cash award of $200,000. The Steinberg committee said, in part: "Her work sparks conversation in audiences of all ages with its emotionally vivid language [...] Sarah Ruhl is unique. She fills her intelligent and highly theatrical plays with striking oddities and playful humor. Sarah is a prolific playwright of great distinction.[58]

"A lot of people think that because my father was an actor, I come from this big show-business background," Hutton toldBruce CookofAmerican Filmmagazine in 1981.
But that's not how I grew up at all. My mother took us toCambridgebecause she wanted to get her M.A. She wound up teaching in Connecticut, but the way she saw it, after a while, if we all stayed there, my sister and I would just wind up as the proprietors of the local drugstore or something, so that was why she took us toBerkeley, California—to get us into the world, I guess. Now she's given up teaching and she's into printing miniature books.[3]

I grew up under the British system, which I think is horrific for children — very, very strict — a system that did not recognize children as being individuals. You were small animals earning the right to be human. Childhood for me then felt extraordinarily powerless, and as an artistic child who learned in alternative ways, it was hell. I was beaten regularly... A good child was a fearful child, and I was a very, very, good little girl, which meant I lived in a world of silent, dark terror most of the time.[4]

There was a lot of confusion and nonsense where I grew up, so I reacted by creating my own little world.[...] I began to see how music could change lives, and I began to dream about a world where every day was like anime and Broadway, where music fell from the sky and anything could happen.
Janelle Monáe Robinson was born on December 1, 1985, inKansas City, Kansas, and was raised inQuindaro, a working-class community of Kansas City.[23]Her mother, Janet, worked as a janitor and a hotel maid.[23][24]Her father, Michael Robinson Summers, was a truck driver.[25]Monáe's parents separated when Monáe was a toddler and her mother later married a postal worker. Monáe has a younger sister, Kimmy, from her mother's remarriage.[23]
Monáe was raisedBaptistand learned to sing at a local church. Her family members were musicians and performers at the localAfrican Methodist Episcopalchurch, theBaptist church, and theChurch of God in Christ.[23][25]Monáe dreamed of being a singer and a performer from a very young age,[22]and has cited the fictional character ofDorothy GalefromThe Wizard of Ozas a musical influence.[26]The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which Monáe bought two copies of with her first check, was another source of inspiration.[27]She performed songs from the album onJuneteenthtalent shows, winning three years in a row.[23]
As a teenager, Monáe was enrolled in the Coterie Theater's Young Playwrights' Round Table,[28][29]which began writing musicals. One musical, completed when she was around the age of 12, was inspired by the 1979Stevie WonderalbumJourney Through "The Secret Life of Plants".[29]
Monáe attendedF. L. Schlagle High School,[25]and after high school, moved toNew York Cityto study musical theater at theAmerican Musical and Dramatic Academy, where she was the only black woman in her class.[28][29]Monáe enjoyed the experience, but feared that she might lose her edge and "sound, or look or feel like anybody else".[28]In a 2010 interview Monáe explained, "I felt like that was a home but I wanted to write my own musicals. I didn't want to have to live vicariously through a character that had been played thousands of times – in a line with everybody wanting to play the same person."[29]
After a year and a half, Monáe dropped out of the academy and relocated toAtlanta, enrolling atGeorgia Perimeter College. She began writing her own music and performing around the campus.[28]In 2003, Monáe self-released ademo albumtitledThe Audition,[30]which she sold out of the trunk of aMitsubishi Galant.[28]During this period she worked at anOffice Depotbut was fired for answering a fan's e-mail using a company computer, an incident that inspired the song "Lettin' Go", which in turn attracted the attention ofBig Boi.[29]
Monáe appeared on thePurple Ribbon All-StarsalbumGot Purp? Vol. 2as well as on OutKast's 2006 albumIdlewild, where she was featured on the songs "Call the Law" and "In Your Dreams".[31]Big Boi told his friendSean Combsabout Monáe, of whom at the time Combs had not yet heard. Combs soon visited Monáe'sMySpacepage and according to aHitQuartersinterview withBad Boy RecordsA&R person Daniel 'Skid' Mitchell, Combs loved it right away: "[He] loved her look, loved that you couldn't see her body, loved the way she was dancing, and just loved the vibe. He felt like she has something that was different – something new and fresh."[32]
Monáe signed to the label, Bad Boy, in 2006. The label's chief role was to facilitate her exposure on a much broader scale rather than develop the artist and her music, as Mitchell noted: "She was already moving, she already had her records – she had a self-contained movement." Combs and Big Boi wanted to take their time and build her profile organically and allow the music to grow rather than put out "a hot single which everyone jumps on, and then they fade because it's just something of the moment."[32]
In 2007, Monáe released her first solo work,Metropolis.It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or "suites", which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series,Metropolis: Suite I (The Chase)in mid-2007, these plans were altered following signing with Sean Combs's label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitledMetropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition)and included two new tracks. The EP was critically acclaimed, garnering Monáe a 51st Annual Grammy AwardsGrammynomination forBest Urban/Alternative Performancefor the single "Many Moons",[33]festival appearances and opening slots forindie popbandof Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for bandNo Doubton their summer 2009 tour.[34]Her single "Open Happiness" was featured in the 2009 season finale ofAmerican Idol.[35]Monáe told MTV about the concept for her new album and also discussed analter egonamed Cindi Mayweather. She said:
Cindy is an android and I love speaking about the android because they are the new "other". People are afraid of the other and I believe we're going to live in a world with androids because of technology and the way it advances. The first album she was running because she had fallen in love with a human and she was being disassembled for that.[36]
In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album,The ArchAndroid. The album was released on May 18, 2010. The second and third suites ofMetropolisare combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter ego, Cindi Mayweather – also the protagonist ofMetropolis: The Chase Suite– becomes amessianicfigure to theandroidcommunity of Metropolis.[37]Monáe announced plans to shoot a video for each song onThe ArchAndroidand create a film,graphic noveland a touring Broadway musical based on the album.[38]TheMetropolisconcept series draws inspiration from a wide range of musical, cinematic and other sources, ranging fromAlfred HitchcocktoDebussytoPhilip K. Dick. The series puts Fritz Lang's 1927 silent filmMetropolis, which Monáe referred to as "the godfather of science-fiction movies", in special regard.[39][40]Aside from sharing a name, they also share visual styles (the cover forThe ArchAndroidis inspired by the iconic poster forMetropolis), conceptual themes and political goals, using expressionistic future scenarios to examine and explore contemporary ideas of prejudice and class. Both also include a performing female android, though to very different effect. WhereMetropolisandroid Maria is the evil, havoc-sowing double of the messianic figure to the city's strictly segregated working class, Monáe's messianic android muse Cindi Mayweather represents an interpretation of androids as that segregated minority, which Monáe describes as "...theOther. And I feel like all of us, whether in the majority or the minority, felt like the Other at some point."[39][41]
Monáe received the Vanguard Award from theAmerican Society of Composers, Authors and Publishersat the Rhythm & Soul Music Awards in 2010.[42]Monáe coveredCharlie Chaplin'sSmileon Billboard.com in June 2010.

In a July 2023 interview withThe Current, Monáe described their new album as "a movement" and "a soundtrack to a lifestyle" emphasizing the unapologetic pursuit of radical joy.[128]The sensual and summery beats of the songs and accompanying music videos for tracks like "Water Slide" and "Lipstick Lover" continue to build upon depictions of queer love and acceptance common in Monáe's work.[129]
The album was nominated forAlbum of the YearandBest Progressive R&B Albumat the66th Annual Grammy Awards.[130]
Monáe has amezzo-sopranovoice.[131]The Telegraphpublished an interview with Monáe, talking about her first studio album, in which the journalist Bernadette McNulty said, "I begin to worry for a moment that Monáe may not just be a humourless science-fictionnerd, but actually an android herself, created in a laboratory as a super-musical cross betweenJames Brown,Judy Garland,André 3000andSteve Jobs, invented to test the desperate incredulity of music journalists." She also compared Monáe to artists such asAnnie Lennox,Lauryn Hill, andCorinne Bailey Rae.[132]Monáe's musical styles have been described as "a soaring orchestral trip enlivened with blockbuster vocals, mysterious imagery and notes of Sixties pop and jazz".[133]The Guardianhas noted some of Monáe's influences asMichael Jackson,Janet Jackson,Prince,Outkast,Erykah Badu,James Brown,Grace Jones,Stevie Wonder,David Bowie,Jimi Hendrix,Bernard Herrmann,Funkadelicand theIncredible String Band.[29]Matthew Valnes likens Monáe's dancing style in the music video for "Tightrope" to that of James Brown.[134]In an opinion piece forThe Quietus,[135]John Calvert places Janelle Monáe within theAfrofuturismmovement, pointing out her similarities toSun RaandGeorge Clinton. He asserts that Janelle Monáe is innovating the genre. Monáe has said she has an alter ego from the year 2719, named Cindi Mayweather.[136]
Inher first EP, Monáe gave this alter ego a back story: she was on the run after breaking the law in her home town of Metropolis by falling in love with a human, Anthony Greendown. Monáe has expanded on Cindi's mythos, saying, "The Archandroid, Cindi, is the mediator, between the mind and the hand. She's the mediator between the haves and the have-nots, the oppressed and the oppressor. She's like theArchangelin theBible, and whatNeorepresents toThe Matrix."[137]In hersecond album, Cindi Mayweather returned to Earth to liberate Metropolitans from the Great Divide, an oppressive oligarchy that used time travel to "suppress freedom and love".[138]Chris Champion ofThe ObserverdescribedMetropolisandThe ArchAndroidas "psychedelic soulwith a sci-fi twist".[139]Matthew Valnes describes Monáe as innovating a more contemporary Neo-Afrofuturism, where the android role is used as a tool to critique the representation of Black female musicians in the funk genre. Funk music of 1960s through 1980s is a prevalent music style influencing Monáe. The website for Monáe's Wondaland Arts Society Collective asserts, "We believe there are only three forms of music; good music, bad music, and funk."[134]Monáe has also referred to herself as a "funkstress".[140]
Monáe's roots in Kansas City, Kansas, where she was born and raised, are evident in her lyrics and style. According to Carrie Battan'sPitchforkfeature on Monáe, the song "Ghetto Woman" directly addresses Monáe's working-class K.C., Kansas mother – as well as the portrayal of working-class black women in U.S. culture – with the line "Carry on, ghetto woman, even when the news portrays you less than you could be."[1]Monáe also told theLondon Evening Standardshe has internalized her KCK (K.C., KS) roots by wearing the working-class uniform of her parents and expressing concern that she cannot let "her community down".[141]On the albumThe ArchAndroid, especially in songs like "Cold War" or "BabopbyeYa", Monáe relates "the dystopian cityscapes depicted in Metropolis to the boarded-up projects of poverty-wracked Kansas".[142]Kansas City, therefore, not only represents Monáe's physical roots within her hometown, but also serves as an important influence on the lyrics and science-fictional setting.
I feel like I have a responsibility to my community and other young girls to help redefine what it looks like to be a woman. I don't believe in men's wear or women's wear, I just like what I like. And I think we should just be respected for being an individual... I've been inVogue, now, and different publications, which is cool, because I think that it just shows a different perspective of how women can dress.
Monáe's signature style is hertuxedowardrobe. She said "I bathe in it, I swim in it, and I could be buried in it. A tux is such a standard uniform, it's so classy and it's a lifestyle I enjoy. The tux keeps me balanced. I look at myself as a canvas. I don't want to cloud myself with too many colors or I'll go crazy. It's an experiment I'm doing. I think I want to be in the Guinness Book of World Records."[143]Monáe's signature look harkens back todandyism.[144]CitingGrace JonesandJosephine Bakeras role models, Monáe takes the classical 18th-century look in the classical white and black pattern.[145]Monáe's signature look can also be attributed to the early days in her career, when she was employed as a maid. She mentioned this in her acceptance speech for the "Young, Gifted, and Black" award at the 2012Black Girls Rock!ceremony.[146]Monáe has been known to distribute theTen Droid Commandments, which encourages her fans to be individuals.[137]The Telegraphalso commented on her image as an artist, saying, "Sitting in a grey, airless record company office, this slight, stiff young woman delivers her speech in slow, deliberate tones, utterly expressionless. Dressed in her trademark starched shirt and tuxedo, hair immaculately coiffed, Monáe's face is an opaque mask of perfection: all silken smooth skin, button nose and glassy brown eyes."[132]Monáe describes tuxedos as a uniform for her career, speaks of wanting to redefine how women dress,[137]and has been featured in the "Style 100" ofInStylemagazine.[147]TheCouncil of Fashion Designers of America Awardshonored Monáe with the Board of Directors' Tribute and the American Ingenuity Award for her "straoridanra ability to experiment in fashion".[148][149]
When it comes to her acting career, Monáe expressed desire to shape it around that ofJohnny Depp, stating that he has a very vast career: "The amount of roles:Willy WonkatoSweeney Toddto all of the dramatic roles. Whatever the Janelle Monáe version of that is. Maybe something even better..."[150]
During a 2011 interview withLondon Evening Standard, Monáe said she "only dates androids", a reference to her musical alter ego found in many of her songs. She also said, "I speak about androids because I think the android represents the new 'other'. You can compare it to being a lesbian or being a gay man or being a Black woman... what I want is for people who feel oppressed or feel like the 'other' to connect with the music and to feel like, 'She represents who I am.'" She added that she would talk about her sexual orientation "in due time".[141]In 2013, Monáe said she wants both men and women to "still be attracted to [her]" and expressed support for theLGBTQ community.[151]
Monáe has said she identifies with bothbisexualityandpansexuality.[23]On January 10, 2020, shetweetedthehashtag#IAmNonbinary, along with a quoted tweet, which trended on Twitter that day.[152][153]Monáe said in an interview withThe Cuta month after the tweet that "I tweeted the #IAmNonbinary hashtag in support of Nonbinary Day and to bring more awareness to the community. I retweeted theSteven Universememe 'Are you a boy or a girl? I'm an experience' because it resonated with me, especially as someone who has pushed boundaries of gender since the beginning of my career. I feel my feminine energy, my masculine energy, and energy I can't even explain."[154]
In April 2022, shecame outpublicly asnon-binaryon theRed Table Talksaying, "I'm nonbinary, so I just don't see myself as a woman, solely... I feel like god is so much bigger than the 'he' or the 'she.' And if I am from God, I am everything."[155]In the interview, she also acknowledged having been in bothmonogamousandpolyamorousrelationships.[155]Following the interview, a representative of Monáe said that she "continues to use she/her pronouns."[156]In an interview with theLos Angeles Times, however, Monáe identified herself as non-binary and added that her "pronouns are free-ass motherfucker—and they/them, her/she."[157][158]

In the late 1990s, during the release of her albumBathhouse Betty(1998), Midler commented on her time performing there, "Despite the way things turned out [with the AIDS crisis], I'm still proud of those days.

Midler told Carson in an interview that she always wanted to move like the sisters, and Patty Andrews remembered: "When I first heard the introduction on the radio, I thought it was our old record. When Bette opened at the Amphitheater in Los Angeles, Maxene and I went backstage to see her. Her first words were, 'What else did you record?'"[25]During another Midler concert, Maxene went on stage and presented her with an honorary bugle. Bette recorded other Andrews Sisters hits, including "In the Mood" and "Lullaby of Broadway".[25]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
