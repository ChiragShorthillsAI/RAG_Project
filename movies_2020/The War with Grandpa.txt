After accidentally stealing from a grocery store due to having trouble with the self-checkouts and causing a scene with the store manager, recently widowed Ed Marino is visited by his daughter Sally Marino-Decker who wants him to move in with her family. Ed does not want to leave his house because he built it himself, but Sally, concerned about her father's well-being, convinces Ed to move in with her and gives him her son Peter's bedroom. Peter is not happy about giving his room to his grandfather and being moved to the attic. Ed is welcomed by Sally's husband Arthur and two daughters, Mia and Jenny. During his first day, Ed spends most of his time in his new room, sitting in his chair and looking at the sky while still thinking about his late wife.
Peter then tells his friends Billy, Steve, and Emma about his grandfather moving in with his family and living in his room. After a miserable first night in his new room, Peter decides to declare war. Ed agrees, as long as they follow therules of engagement: they cannot damage other people's belongings and cannot tell the family about their arrangement. Peter pulls a series of pranks, including replacing Ed's shaving cream with quick-drying foam and damaging his record player. Ed gets back at Peter with pranks including removing all of the screws from Peter's furniture and rewriting his school report. Ed turns to his friends Danny and Jerry for some advice. Over time, Ed begins to spend time with his granddaughters and son-in-law and learns how to use modern technology, such as self-checkouts and apps.
Sally learns that Mia is dating a boy named Russell, whom she does not approve of. Ed invites Jerry, Danny, and a store worker named Diane, who Ed has befriended to playdodgeballagainst Peter and his friends. Peter and his friends win the first round, but Ed and his team manage to beat them during the second round. However, during the third round, Danny's jaw is injured, and the game is declared a tie. Later, Peter pushes the button on Ed's emergency call necklace and Ed picks Peter up from school to take him fishing. The two discover that it is illegal to fish there. Ed then takes Peter to his old house and explains that he left some secrets in the walls.
Ed learns that Peter is being bullied, so he, Danny, and Jerry throw the bully in a dumpster. At Jenny's Christmas-themed birthday party, Peter keeps his promise about not pulling any pranks. Peter rigs up an ejector seat for Ed, who is supposed to be playing the part of Santa that night. Unfortunately, a last-minute change results in Jerry being dressed up as Santa. Throughout the party, Peter and Ed are asked to help out. Instead, they continue to prank each other, including spraying bottles at each other and Peter plugging the cord to the lights as Ed checks them, shocking Ed. As a result of their hijinks, they inadvertently reveal their war with each other to everyone. Jerry gets ejected from his chair, resulting in further property damage and injuries to multiple guests. During this, Jenny's Christmas tree prop falls onto the house, leaving a hole in Mia's room and revealing Mia's secret tryst with Russell. Afterwards, Ed is injured and taken to the hospital.
As punishment, Arthur and Sally place Peter and Mia under "work arrest" for six months. Russell shows up; Sally initially seems angry at him, but instead welcomes him. Sally goes to pick up Ed from the hospital, but learns that he has already checked out and hisLyftdriver Chuck has taken him to his old house. Peter decides to make amends and begs Ed to move back in with the family. The two finally reconcile, as Sally listens.
As time passes, Ed and Peter seem to finally be getting along until Ed leaves one day to be with Diane, with whom he is now in a relationship. Peter looks on angrily, declaring a war on both of them as they leave.

His Oscar-winning performance inThe Deer Hunterwas ranked as the 88th greatest film performance of all time byPremieremagazine[51]and his performance inPennies from Heavenmade it intoEntertainment Weekly's list of the "100 Greatest Performances that should have won Oscars but didn't."[52]Sometimes regarded as "one of the kings ofcameos", Walken has made severalcameo appearancesor appeared in a single scene of films including as Captain Koons inPulp Fiction, Duane inAnnie Hall, Hessian Horseman inSleepy Hollowand Don Vincenzo inTrue Romance. Writer and directorQuentin Tarantinodeclared that Walken's involvement inTrue Romance's "Sicilian scene" was one of the proudest moments in his career.[53]
Benicio del Torocited Walken as an influence and stated that the best advice he had ever been given regarding acting came from him: "When you're in a scene and you don't know what you're gonna do, don't do anything."[54]Kat Denningscalled him her favorite actor and said that he was the reason that she wanted to be an actress.[55]Johnny Depponce said one of the main reasons he starred inNick of Timewas wanting to work with Walken.[56]Jeffrey Wright,[57]Mickey Rourke,[58]Sam Rockwell,[59]Colin Farrell,[60]Bradley Cooper,[61]Leonardo DiCaprio[62]andMads Mikkelsen[63]are among actors who spoke about their admiration for Walken.

Walken is noted for refusing film roles only rarely, having stated in interviews that he will decline a role only if he is too busy to accept. He regards each role as a learning experience.[66]A rare example of a role Walken turned down was that of Ray Ruby in the filmGo Go Tales(2007). According to film directorAbel Ferrara, the character was originally written for Walken, who "didn't want to do it". The role was then given to Walken'sNew Rose Hotel(1998) co-starWillem Dafoe.[67]
Walken's voice and speaking style have been compared to other entertainment figures with voices that create "a pleasing (or at least entertaining) aural experience," such asWilliam ShatnerandGarrison Keillor.[68]Walken believes that the source of his speech stems from growing up with immigrant neighbors who came from everywhere, stating, "The neighborhood itself, you didn't hear a lot of English. Lots of Greek, Italian, Polish, German, Yiddish. I think I grew up listening to people who spoke English in a kind of broken way. I think maybe I talked that way."[69]Walken inspired the stage show,All About Walken: The Impersonators of Christopher Walken, created by actor/comedian Patrick O'Sullivan in Hollywood in 2006.
In 2003, he was voted Number 34 inChannel 4's countdown of the 100 greatest movie stars of all time.[70]
Walken has hosted the comedy sketch and satire TV seriesSaturday Night Live(SNL) seven times.[71]
One of Walken'sSNLperformances was a spoof ofBehind the Music, featuring a recording session ofBlue Öyster Cult's "(Don't Fear) the Reaper". In the guise of record producer Bruce Dickinson (not to be confused with the realBruce Dickinson, lead singer forIron Maiden), Walken makes passionate and slightly unhinged speeches to the band and is obsessed with getting "More Cowbell" into the song. The phrase "I gotta have more cowbell" has since been adapted to merchandise. The producer who suggested the cowbell on the original BÖC recording isDavid Lucas.
Walken appeared in one ofWill FerrellandRachel Dratch's "The Luvahs" skits.[72]His character brought a lady friend to meet The Luvahs and she is subjected to learning the history that Walken's character shares with The Luvahs. He also divulges private information about his sex life with his girlfriend, much to her horror ("She was willing to accept her lover's body in places no one had ever trespassed... specifically, the ear canal").
Walken spoofed his starring role fromThe Dead Zone(1983) in a sketch titled "Ed Glosser: TrivialPsychic" (1992).[73]In the film, Walken's character can predict deaths and catastrophes, while Glosser can accurately predict meaningless, trivial future events but with the same emotional intensity as in the film: "You're going to get anice cream headache. It's going to hurt real bad, right here, [touches forehead] for eight, nine seconds.").
His character inA View to a Killwas parodied in a sketch titled "Lease with an Option to Kill", in which he reprised his role asMax Zorin. Zorin, who had taken on some qualities of other Bond villains (Blofeld's cat and suit,Emilio Largo's eye patch), was upset that everything was going wrong for him. His lair was still under construction; his henchmen had jump suits that didn't fit; and his shark tank lacked sharks, having a giantsea spongeinstead. A captiveJames Bond, portrayed byPhil Hartman, offered to get Zorin "a good deal" on the abandoned Blofeld volcanic lair if Zorin let him go, to which he reluctantly agreed.
He performed a song and dance rendition of theIrving Berlinstandard, "Let's Face the Music and Dance". Finally, there was the "Colonel Angus" sketch,[74]laden with ribalddouble entendres, in which Walken played a dishonoredConfederateofficer.
Until 2003, Walken had a recurringSNLsketch called "The Continental",[75]in which Walken played a "suave ladies' man" who in reality cannot do anything to keep a woman (a neighbor in his apartment building) from giving him the cold shoulder. Though he is outwardly chivalrous, his more perverted tendencies inevitably drive away his date over his pleading objections. For instance, he invites the woman to wash up in his bathroom; once she is inside, it becomes obvious that the bathroom mirror is atwo-way mirrorwhen he is seen lighting up a cigarette. In "The Continental", only the hand of his neighbor is ever seen; the camera always shows her point of view.
The April 5, 2008Saturday Night Liveshow was the first time an episode hosted by Walken did not have a "Continental" sketch or a monologue in which he sang and danced. This episode, however, did include one sketch titled "Walken Family Reunion",[76]which spoofs many of Walken'sidiosyncrasies. The sketch depicts a fictional Walkenfamily reunion, where all of Christopher's relatives have his mannerisms and speech patterns and sport his trademarkpompadour hairstyle. In order of appearance, the other Walkens are Christopher's cousin Stanley (Bill Hader); Stanley's brother John (Jason Sudeikis); John's son Scott (Andy Samberg) and daughter Maxine (Amy Poehler) (who carries adollthat also has a pompadour); Nathan (Fred Armisen), a gay relative for whom "flamboyance" means dressing all in black and running his finger around the rim of acosmoglass; Uncle Richard (Darrell Hammond) and Aunt Martha (Kristen Wiig), who think thatThe Deer Hunterwas hilarious and who are hosts of aNigerianforeign exchange studentnamed Oleki (Kenan Thompson). When he came to live with them, Oleki—who has absorbed all of the Walken Family traits—could not speak any English. But now (he says) he "talks like a normal teenaged American boy". The biggest laugh of the sketch occurs when Christopher expresses his sympathies for Scott's teenaged attitude: "I appreciate your situation. For a Walken, adolescence is a difficult time. You feel like you're the only normal person in a school full of nutjobs." Scott's response: "Wow! It's like you're lookin' right into my noggin!" (Will Fortealso appears as a waiter at the beginning of the sketch, but does not do a Walken impression.)
In September 2004,SNLreleased a DVD titledThe Best of Christopher WalkenthroughLionsgate.[77]
Walken returned to the show for the first time in 15 years on October 28, 2023, in a cameo role as the "Spirit of Halloween" in which he gave advice toPresident Joe Biden(Mikey Day). Walken also introduced the musical guestFoo Fightersinstead of hostNate Bargatze. Foo Fighters were the musical guest during his 2003 episode, during whichDave Grohlpranked Walken into speaking with the emphasis on "Fighters" instead of "Foo". Clips of the introduction later became aninternet memeand Walken pronounced the band's name correctly in 2023.
Walken became the subject of a hoax controversy in 2006, when a fake website started in August of that year by members of Internet forum Genmay.com announced that he was running for President of the United States. Some believed it was authentic, until Walken's publicist dismissed the claims.[78]When asked about the hoax in a September 2006 interview withConan O'Brien, Walken said he was amused and when asked to come up with a campaign slogan, he replied, "What the Heck" and "No More Zoos!"[78]
In 1963, Walken metGeorgianne Thonduring a tour ofWest Side Story.[79]They married in January 1969. The couple have no children, and Walken has stated in interviews that not having children is one of the reasons that he has had such a prolific career.[80]
Walken discussed his feelings on sexuality in a 1973 interview withAfter Darkwhile promoting his appearance asBassanioinThe Merchant of Venice. "I suppose I think of the man I'm playing as bisexual, and I suppose that's how I think of myself too. I'd hate to think that I was harnessed to heterosexuality. I mean, my life is heterosexual, but I like to think that my head is bisexual, and I think it's a good idea for everybody to start getting used to that notion, because that way one becomes aware of a lot more things."[81]
On November 29, 1981, Walken was withNatalie WoodandRobert Wagneron Wagner's yacht the night Wood went missing and ultimately was found dead by drowning. Walken was not considered a suspect by authorities.[82]The case was re-opened in November 2011; Walken was once again not considered a suspect and he fully co-operated with authorities conducting the investigation.[83]
In an interview withThe Wall Street Journal, Walken said, "I don't have technology. I only have a satellite dish on my house. So I've seenSeveranceon DVDs that they're good enough to send me. I don't have a cell phone. I've never emailed or, what do you call it, Twittered."[84][85]

Thefive-pound British gold coinhas been struck intermittently since 1820, but was issued as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse,Benedetto Pistrucci's portrayal ofSaint George and the Dragon, traditionally used on thesovereign. The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage ofEdward VIIIsold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
