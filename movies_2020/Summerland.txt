Summerlandis a 2020 Britishdrama filmwritten and directed byJessica Swale, starringGemma Arterton,Gugu Mbatha-Raw,Lucas Bond,Dixie Egerickx,Si√¢n Phillips,Penelope WiltonandTom Courtenay.
Arterton plays a reclusive writer forced to take in a young boy entrusted to her care during the Battle of Britain in 1940, and, later, during the early days of theLondon Blitz. It was released in the United Kingdom on 31 July 2020 byLionsgate.
In 1940 Alice Lamb, who is working on her typewriter, lives in a cottage by the seaside in Kent. She has lived in the village since before the start of WWII, during which time she tolerated the harassment by local children who thought she was a witch because she was a loner.
As part of the war effort, the brusque and reclusive writer is entrusted with the care of a young boy, Frank, who has beenevacuatedfrom London where it is unsafe. Alice had not volunteered to be a host and does not want to care for him as she fears it will interfere with her work researching mythology and folklore, but reluctantly agrees to let him stay believing that he has nowhere else to go and she will be able to be rid of him in a week.
As she begins to accept Frank's presence, she recalls herrelationshipwith Vera, a fellow student at university who wanted to be a novelist and with whom she fell in love. Vera breaks Alice's heart when she decides to end their relationship not because theirlesbianismwas considered taboo, but because she has a strong desire to be a mother and it would not be possible with Alice.
Alice and Frank start to bond after he takes an interest in her scholarly work and she explainsFata Morganamirages to him. She tells him aboutThe Summerland, the pagan idea of the afterlife that existed all around them. However, at the end of their week together she is still willing to let him be transferred to another home. Alice changes her mind and decides to keep Frank with her after learning that moving him to a new family will require his moving to another village and school.
The day before Frank's birthday Alice is informed that his father has been killed in battle and she must break the news to him. As she was devastated by the similar loss of her own father, Alice decides to delay telling Frank. While preparing a permanent room for him to stay in, she finds photographs of Frank and his parents in his scrapbook and is shocked to discover that his mother is Vera. At the same time, during an argument with a school friend, Frank finds out that his father had died. Hurt and angry because Alice had not told him, Frank runs away to be with his mother in London. Alice goes after him, and the two arrive in time to find his home destroyed and in flames after abombing. Alice and Frank spend the night in an air raid shelter and head back to Kent the following morning.
While driving back to Kent, Frank yells at Alice to stop, jumps out and runs to the sea. Alice follows him onto the rocks, pleading with him that it is not safe and to come back. Frank shouts at her that she knew about his father's death and did not tell him. Distraught, Alice tells him that she wanted to but did not know how to and apologises. Frank says that he saw his father in Summerland. When he turns round, he slips and falls backwards into the water. He flails under the water until Alice swims out to where he is and manages to rescue him. After helping him get out, both of them gasp and cough up water profusely.
The next morning, Alice brings Frank breakfast which he initially refuses. Alice reveals how she lost her own father years earlier, that she struggled to come to terms with it. She then shows him the room she prepared for him, comforting him when he becomes upset looking through some family photos.
When they return home a few days later, they find Vera waiting for them. She had not been home at the time of the bomb attacks. Vera confesses to having engineered the selection of Alice as the host for Frank because she knew that if anything were to happen to her, Alice would take care of him.
Back in the present time, Alice is in the process of completing her manuscript when Vera suddenly interrupts her. Having reunited some time ago, the two now live together. As they stroll along the beach, an adult Frank, who has come for a visit, joins them. Frank discovers the dedication in Alice's manuscript, and to his surprise, it is dedicated to him.

He attendedKingston High Schooland went on to study English atUniversity College London, where he failed his degree.[2]After this he studied drama at theRoyal Academy of Dramatic Art(RADA) in London.
Courtenay made his stage debut in 1960 with theOld Victheatre company at the Lyceum, Edinburgh, before taking over fromAlbert Finneyin the title role ofBilly Liarat theCambridge Theatrein 1961. In 1963, he played that same title role in the film version, directed byJohn Schlesinger.[3]He said of Albert Finney, "We both have the same problem, overcoming the flat harsh speech ofthe North."[4]
Courtenay's film debut was in 1962 withPrivate Potter, directed by Finnish-born directorCaspar Wrede, who had first spotted Courtenay while he was still at RADA. This was followed byThe Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, directed byTony Richardson, andBilly Liar, two highly acclaimed films and performances which helped usher in theBritish New Waveof the early-to-mid-1960s. For these performances Courtenay was awarded the 1962BAFTA Awardfor most promising newcomer and the 1963BAFTA Awardfor best actor respectively. He also was the first to record the songMrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter, doing so for the TV playThe Lads. The song was released byDeccaon a 45 rpm record.

He played the father ofDerek Bentley(Christopher Eccleston) in the 1991 filmLet Him Have It.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full¬†list...)
Am√©lie of Leuchtenberg(1812‚Äì1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro¬†I. She was the fourth child ofEug√®ne de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Am√©lie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Am√©liawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Am√©lie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Am√©lie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich D√ºrck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
