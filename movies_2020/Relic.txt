When Edna, an elderly widow who is suffering fromdementia, goes missing, her daughter Kay and granddaughter Sam travel to their remote family home to find her. They discover the house locked from the inside, and a strange blackmould-likesubstance on an upstairs wall. Much of the furniture has been adorned withPost-it notesof reminders for Edna.
That night, Sam is visited by their young neighbour Jamie, who states that he had not been to visit Edna for a while after his father had told him not to go back to the house. Sam and Kay grow increasingly disturbed by a loud creaking from inside the walls and the appearance of more black mould throughout the house. Kay experiences nightmares of a withered rotting corpse in an old shack in the woodlands.
The next morning, Kay finds Edna has returned, barefoot and muddied, and unaware of her own disappearance. Following a visit from a doctor, Edna is found to be mostly of sound mind and without injury with the exception of a large black bruise on her chest (resembling the mould). Kay tells Sam that she plans to move Edna into a retirement home, given her self-neglect. That night, Kay awakes to find Edna sleepwalking toward the front door, whispering, "It's nothing." After being brought back to bed, Edna is convinced there is something hiding in the room and urges Kay to check under the bed; Kay sees something breathing but is distracted before she can investigate further.
The next day, Sam and her grandmother share a tender moment until Edna suddenly grows cold and accuses Sam of stealing from her. She snatches the ring off Sam's finger, not remembering that she had gifted Sam this ring. Following another violent event involving Edna, Sam visits Jamie's father Alex to ask why he stopped letting Jamie visit. Alex reveals that the last time Jamie visited, the pair playedhide-and-seek, however, Edna mistakenly locked Jamie in his hiding space and left him there for hours, forgetting she had even seen him that day. Back at the house, Kay follows Edna into the garden, where she finds her tearing pages from the family photo album and frantically eating them. When Kay tries to intervene, Edna bites her and storms off, attempting to bury the album in the soil, claiming it will "be safer there". Fearing that something may come to get her, Edna softens and agrees to let Kay take care of her.
Sam discovers a hidden passageway to another part of the house. She enters but becomes lost as the corridor begins to loop. Disorientated and afraid, she resorts to screaming and banging on the walls. Edna's condition seems to have worsened again; she now glares at Kay mistrustfully, refusing to eat and wetting herself. Kay notices that her mother's urine is stained black. As Edna bathes, she scratches what was once her bruise but is now rotting black flesh. The bathwater overflows and shorts out an electric heater, causing the house's power to go out. Sam travels deeper into the corridors. The ceilings slope lower, forcing her to crawl. She eventually escapes by knocking holes through the mould-covered walls.
Kay finds Edna, much to her horror, picking at her rotting face with a knife. Kay and Sam flee into the passageway when they hear Edna approach. Edna, now disfigured and physically contorted, crawls towards them. Sam and Kay break through the wall and fall into the lounge room, followed by Edna. She attempts to pin down Sam before being beaten down by Kay. Wheezing, the decaying Edna gestures toward a post-it note on the floor, labelled "I AM LOVED?", and smiles. As they escape the house, Kay realises that the walls are no longer rotting and returns to her corpse-like mother to carry her to bed. She helps Edna peel away the last remnants of her hair and flesh to reveal her final form, a withered rotting corpse (like the one in her nightmare). Kay and Sam then lie on the bed with Edna until she peacefully falls asleep.
The film ends with Sam noticing a very small black bruise on the nape of Kay's neck.

JacksonandRobert Carlyle.[12]Upon release, the film was a critical and commercial failure.[17][18]

Based on the novel of thesame title, Mortimer's role inYoung Adamgarnered her acclaim;Evening Standard's critic wrote, "In a performance of naked courage, Emily Mortimer shows that she is prepared to go to extreme lengths of masochism in her depiction of a woman undone by love".[20]Sight & Soundmagazine thought the cast performances were "edgy", and Mortimer made the most out of an underwritten role.[21]She also had a supporting part in the romantic dramaThe Sleeping Dictionary(2003).[22]

It's a relief after the film is over. [...] But when I'm acting, it's good to have something to play against, boundaries to break."[15]
Mortimer also voiced young Sophie in the English-dubbedversion of 2004'sHowl's Moving Castle.[25]In 2005, she played Chloe Wilton, the oblivious spouse ofJonathan Rhys Meyers's adulterer inWoody Allen'sMatch Point.The film premiered at theCannes Film Festival, and co-starredScarlett JohanssonandMatthew Goode.

She co-stars withWoody Harrelson, and they portray a couple who befriend a pair of mysterious travellers. The film premiered at the2008 Sundance Film Festivalto a positive response;[34]Varietymagazine's critic thought Mortimer's character was well-developed, and it was "a very flavorful performance as a reformed bad girl".[35]
A year later, she was cast inDavid Mamet's martial arts dramaRedbelt, playing attorney Laura Black. The film gained fair reviews,[36]andThe Telegraphcritic wrote, "Emily Mortimer is impressive as a jittery, unlikable attorney".[37]In 2009, Mortimer reprised her role as Nicole Durant inThe Pink Panther 2; the film was panned by critics.[38]In the last three episodes of the first season of30 Rock, she playedPhoebe, the mysterious love interest ofAlec Baldwin's character,Jack Donaghy.
Mortimer appeared inDaniel Barber's first film,Harry Brown(2009), as police detective Alice Frampton. The plot follows widowed veteran (Michael Caine), who takes the law into his own hands when teenage violence ruins his community. Mortimer chose the role because "It felt like unfamiliar territory for me which is always a challenge and interesting [...] the script is very gripping and brilliantly written [...] getting to work with Michael, and then just the character being in some ways both the opposite and the same as Michael's character."[39]To prepare for the role, she spent time with a real female detective, and learnt aboutpolice interrogationtechniques. Upon release, the critic fromUSA Todaythought her performance was "caring and savvy", despite the film's "senseless violence".[40]Betsy Sharkey ofLos Angeles Timeswrote of Mortimer's performance: "Her clinical coolness plays well off of Caine's controlled heat."[41]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
