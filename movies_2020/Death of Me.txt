An American couple, Christine and Neil, wake up in their hotel room that is messy and in disarray, and they also find themselves covered in dirt and grass with no recollection of any past events while vacationing on a remote island inThailand. Christine realizes that their flight is about to leave, so they take the ferry back to the mainland, but their passports are missing, and they cannot leave the island, so they must return to the tourist hotel owned by Samantha, where they've been staying.
They wondered what they'd been doing last night, so they checked the recordings of their past events, including visiting a bar, and a bar waitress, Madee, gave Christine a necklace. On that night, they witnessed themselves drugged before Neil attempted to sexually assault Christine and accidentally choked her to death. Scared, Neil buries Christine in the grass. Neil claims that they were drugged from one of the drinks they had and denies everything that happened. Christine then notices that she has bruises on her neck and vomits grass and dirt from her mouth, indicating that everything that night did happen.
Christine and Neil went to check into a local doctor to examine themselves and told him that the bartender put drugs into their drinks and showed him the footage of the incident, but the doctor dismissed their evidence. While recuperating, they are disturbed by the local residents' upcoming festival that depicts pictures of Christine. Neil wants to know about the festival, so he leaves to investigate. Christine suddenly gets sick and goes to the restroom, pulling a snake from her mouth. Meanwhile, Neil records the festival when one of the locals snatches his phone and deletes the footage of Christine and Neil before he recovers it.
Christine hallucinates herself being surrounded by women with their eyes and mouths shut as they inject blood into her. Neil finds her, and Christine sees Mandee and follows her to a tattoo shop. The artist, Kanda, sees the necklace and tells her it was a special gift for Christine since it was said that the artifact contained spiritual magic. Neil bribes Kanda to know about the waitress, and Kanda tells them she is at a different bar. The couple arrives at the bar, and Madee returns Neil's passport, but Christine's is missing. They return to the hotel and Samantha offers them a drink while waiting for a fisherman to take them back to the mainland.
Neil enters a hypnotic trance and is told by the fisherman to kill himself, so he takes a knife and disembowels himself in front of Christine before falling into the sea and passing out. She wakes up back in the room and reports Neil's death to a policeman, but he doesn't believe her. She starts to hallucinate again and finds Neil's body, along with a dozen others, before regaining her senses. She and Samantha rush back to the bar, where she has hallucinations of women with their eyes and mouths sewn shut before waking up back in the tourist room. She experiences stomach pain and is taken to the local doctor, who reveals that she is pregnant. Christine becomes frightened with aultrasoundimage looking monstrous and flees.
She confronts Kanda, who reveals that the reason she's alive despite being killed is that she's stuck in a spiritual plane where she was supposed to be buried by her husband as a sacrifice, and they've been burying pregnant women so that the island can remain safe. Christine hides from the local doctor, who forces Kanda to drink the drug to make her kill herself in a hypnotic trance. Christine tries to flee but learns that Samantha is also involved after she was healed of her cancer, so Christine grabs a gun and shoots Samantha, killing her. She tries to flee but is captured by the locals. They tie her up, and Mandee begins to sewn one of her eyes when Christine breaks free from the restraint.
As the storm approaches, Christine escapes in the boat. The storm ravages the island, killing all the inhabitants and Christine. Rescuers recover the bodies, and one of them places the necklace next to Christine's dead body, allowing its magic to resurrect her.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
