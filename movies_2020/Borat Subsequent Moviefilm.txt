It is a sequel to 2006'sBorat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.
Although BaronCohen had said in 2007 that he had retired the Borat character, he was spotted in 2019 in the disguise, and was seen filming in mid-2020, leading to speculation of a secondBoratfilm. The project was officially announced in September 2020, withAmazon Studiosacquiring the distribution rights.Borat Subsequent Moviefilmwas released on October23, 2020, onAmazon Prime Video. It received praise from critics for BaronCohen's and Bakalova's performances, as well as for its commentary on American culture; formerNew York City mayorRudy Giuliani's appearance, however, was polarizing.
The film received three nominations at the78th Golden Globe Awards, winning forGolden Globe Award for Best Actor—Motion Picture Musical or Comedyfor Baron Cohen andBest Motion Picture—Musical or Comedy. At the93rd Academy Awards, it was nominated forBest Adapted ScreenplayandBest Supporting Actressfor Bakalova.

The movie holds theGuinness World Recordfor the longest title of anOscarnominated film.[2][3]
After 14 years of forced labor in agulagfor the dishonor inflicted onhis countryin hisprevious adventure, Kazakh journalistBorat Sagdiyevis released by his country's president,Nursultan Nazarbayev, with a mission to deliver Kazakh Minister of Culture (and Kazakhstan's most famousporn actor) Johnny the Monkey to PresidentDonald Trumpin an attempt to redeem the nation. Unable to get close to Trump after defecating in the landscaping ofTrump International Hotel and Towerin the previous film, Borat opts to give the monkey to Vice PresidentMike Pence. Before leaving, he discovers that his arch-nemesis neighbor, Nursultan Tulyakbay, has stolen his family and home and that he has a 15-year-old daughter, Tutar, who lives in his barn.
Borat is transported across the world in a circuitous route by cargo ship and arrives inGalveston, Texas, where he finds he is a celebrity. Wanting to maintain a low profile, Borat purchases multiple disguises. He buys a cell phone and welcomes Johnny but finds that Tutar is in Johnny's shipping crate and has eaten him. Horrified, Borat faxes Nazarbayev, who tells him to find a way to satisfy Pence or he will be executed. Borat decides to give Tutar to Pence.
Tutar receives a makeover, and Borat introduces her at adebutante ball. Her menstrual blood is prominently displayed at the ball during a father and daughter dance. Discovering that Pence is nearby atCPAC, Borat disguises himself as Trump and attempts to give Tutar there, but security ejects him. Nazarbayev is enraged and tells him to return to Kazakhstan for execution. Realizing that he can still give Tutar to someone close to Trump, Tutar suggests giving her toRudy Giuliani.
Because Giuliani had bragged about having an affair with a large-breasted woman, Borat brings Tutar to a cosmetic surgeon who advises breast implants. While Borat works in a barbershop to raise enough money to pay for breast surgery, he briefly leaves Tutar with a babysitter who is confused by Borat's sexist teachings. She informs Tutar that the things her culture has taught her are lies. After Tutar sees a woman driving a car and successfully masturbates for the first time, she decides not to get the surgery and lashes out at Borat for keeping her oppressed her whole life. Before leaving, she tells him thatthe Holocaust, their country’s "greatest accomplishment," is a lie by citing aHolocaust denialFacebookpage.
Shaken, Borat decides to commit suicide by going to the nearest synagogue dressed as his version of a stereotypical Jew and waiting for the nextmass shootingbut is shocked to find Holocaust survivors there who treat him with kindness and to hisanti-Semiticdelight, reassure him that the Holocaust happened. Overjoyed, Borat looks for Tutar but finds the streets deserted due to theCOVID-19 pandemic. He quarantines with twoQAnonconspiracy theoristswho offer to help him reunite with Tutar. They find Tutar online, who has become a reporter and will be covering aMarch for Our Rightsrally inOlympia, Washington.
At the rally, the men appeal to Tutar, telling her that her dad will be killed unless she helps. She accepts and arranges an interview to seduce Giuliani without her father's participation. Borat talks with her babysitter and has a change of heart, realizing that he loves Tutar. After the interview, Giuliani and Tutar proceed to a bedroom before Borat intervenes and tries to offer sexual favors to Giuliani personally. Borat decides to face execution in Kazakhstan, and Tutar promises to go with him.
Borat is shocked to find he will not be executed as he had instead been used as retaliation by Nazarbayev for making Kazakhstan a laughingstock. Before departing for the United States, Kazakhstan officials infected Borat withSARS-CoV-2via an injection of "gypsytears," making himpatient zeroof the COVID-19 pandemic. As he was sent around the world, he continued to spread the virus. Borat uses a recording made near the beginning of his trip to convince Nazarbayev that his admission has been recorded and sent to Brian, the man who sold Borat his phone and whom Borat claims is America's Minister of Technology.
Borat and Tutar blackmail Nazarbayev into giving him his job back and changing Kazakhstan's misogynistic laws. Three months later, Tutar and Borat are a reporting team, and Kazakhstan has a new tradition to replace the nation's antisemitic ones: the Running of the American. It features exaggerated caricatures of Trump supporters and "Karens" pretending to spread COVID-19 and killing an effigy ofAnthony Fauci. The film ends with a message encouraging viewers to vote in thethen-upcoming presidential election.
Mike PenceandRudy Giulianiappear as themselves. Bystanders included in the film include salesman Brian Patrick Snyder,Instagraminfluencerand entertainer Macy Chanel,[11]crisis pregnancy centerownerPastorJonathan Bright,debutantecoachDr. Jean Sheffield, Dallas-basedplastic surgeonand naval reservist Charles Wallace,[12][10]professionalbabysitterJeanise Jones, Wooten's Barbershop (Eatonton, Georgia) patron Alan "Randy" Knight, the Hillsborough Republican Women's Club,QAnonconspiracy theorists Jerry Holleman and Jim Russell, andHolocaust survivorJudith Dim Evans.[7]The character of Johnny the Monkey—a porn star and Kazakhstani government minister—was given a fictionalized backstory as a famous monkey actor.[10]
Sid Miller,Donald Trump, andDonald Trump Jr.were originally in the film, but their scenes were cut.[13][14]ComedianLuenellwas filmed as the character Luenell, the prostitute who marries Borat at the end of the first film, but her scenes were also cut.[15]
Rupert Murdochannounced in early February 2007 that BaronCohen had signed on to do another Borat film with20th Century Fox, distributor of the first film.[16]BaronCohen later claimed that Borat was to be discontinued, as he was now too well known to avoid detection as he did in the film and onDa Ali G Show.[17]A spokesman for Fox later stated that it was too early to begin planning such a film, although they were open to the idea.[18]In 2014, he brought back Borat for theFXXseriesAliG: Rezurection, a compilation of the sketches fromDa AliG Showwith new footage.[19]He also briefly appeared as Borat in December2015 on an episode ofJimmy Kimmel Live!to promote the filmGrimsby[20]and again in November2018 to encourage Americans to vote in that year'smidterm elections.[21]In the two years leading up to the release, the film's star became more concerned about being politically active, giving speeches and interviews in-person to combat racism; he insisted on releasing the film immediately before the2020 presidential electionto provoke alarm among Americans about a slide intoilliberal democracy.[22]
Like several of Sacha BaronCohen's films, the score is composed by his brotherErran Baron Cohen, in addition to other original recordings by Romanian Balkan bandFanfare Ciocărliaand their version of "Just the Two of Us"; Canadian roots musician Adrian Raso performing "Urn St.Tavern".[23]
Filming did not begin until Tutar was cast; Bakalova was chosen for the role among 600 actresses who auditioned.[24]She initially sent in a tape of her acting for an unnamed Hollywood movie she suspected may have been ahuman traffickingscam, but she ended up going to London to rehearse with BaronCohen, convincing her that this was a real opportunity.[25]Ken Davitian, who portrayedAzamat Bagatovin the firstBorat, was offered the opportunity to reprise his role, but did not sign on because the producers would not tell him that the film was aBoratsequel.[26]An early prank filmed in late 2019 involved a farcical interview withTexas Agriculture CommissionerSid Miller,[13]followed by a trip to anArlington, Texasdriving range;[27]the scenes were cut from the film but appear in the trailer.[28]In February2020, BaronCohen was spotted dressed up asDonald Trump, interrupting theConservative Political Action Conference(CPAC), although his true identity was not revealed at the time.[29][30][31]
That same month, BaronCohen traveled toMacon, Georgia, to trick attendees of a fakedebutante ball,[32]telling the organizers at theJohnston–Felton–Hay Housethat he was filming acoming-of-agestory.[33]He was briefly pulled over by a police officer for having Bakalova riding on the roof of his vehicle; body cam footage clearly shows he was identified as himself the comedian, as opposed to his character.[34]The crew also attendedMarietta-based Temple Kol Emeth to film the scenes with Evans.[10]The production made at least two visits to upstate South Carolina to film at a bakery, crisis pregnancy center, and Halloween supply store.[35]On June 27, 2020, Cohen performedpranksat a gun rally inOlympia, Washington,[36]leading attendees to sing along with racist lyrics to an original song,[37]and interviewed members of the crowd.[38]When demonstrators picketing the rally recognized BaronCohen and began laughing, the crowd and organizers realized they were being pranked and quickly turned violent, but were slowed from storming the stage as security had been hired by theBoratteam. Eventually, BaronCohen and his crew were forced to flee in a private ambulance, with BaronCohen having to physically hold the door shut as members of the crowd tried to break in.[39]News media quickly learned about the prank but speculated it was for a new season ofWho Is America?[37]
The following month, he was spotted in Los Angeles dressed as Borat and filming, leading to speculation from the public that BaronCohen's next project was aBoratsequel.[40]During two days of filming, BaronCohen was required to wear a bulletproof vest due to the possible threats of the scene.[41]
In early September2020, rumors began to circulate claiming that the film was completely shot, assembled, and screened forfilm industryexecutives;[42]the title was originally leaked asBorat2: Great Successand thenBorat: Gift of Pornographic Monkey to Vice Premiere Mikhael Pence to Make Benefit Recently Diminished Nation of Kazakhstan, where the latter was used as one of the title cards. On September20, a prank involving Bakalova infiltrating theWhite Houseand being interviewed byChanel RionofOne America News Networkwas filmed but cut from the final release.[43]The village sequences set in Kazakhstan were shot inRomania(specifically the commune of Valea Albeștiului inAlbești,Mureș County), but not the same village as the previous film after negative feedback from the villagers. Romanian actors were hired for a few parts.[44]
The film was shot on 72 different cameras, including both high-endcinema camerasandsmartphones. The production utilized simplecodecsto mimic the look of the original movie. TheArriAmira andAlexa Miniwere theA,B, andCcameras, accompanied by lesser cameras forhidden,robotic, and low profile applications, includingiPhones.[45]Titmouse, Inc.produced animation services.[46]
In September2020,Amazon Studiosacquired distribution rights to the film for $80 million, and scheduled it for an October23 release.[41][47][48]The film was originally going to be released theatrically byUniversal Picturesafter anegative pickup dealbetween Universal and Baron Cohen. Since Baron Cohen wanted the film to be seen by the widest audience possible before the elections and Universal was at odds with theater chains over its release ofTrolls World TourinPVOD, while theatrical box office was showing weak numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a PVOD release would required a separate transaction between Universal and Baron Cohen, Baron Cohen and Universal agreed to look for potential buyers for the film in streaming services.[48]BaronCohen presented the movie to several streamers who were not willing to release it due to its political content.[22]With the deal with Amazon Studios, Universal was repaid by its outlay and Baron Cohen was compensated in a manner he would have had Universal released the film theatrically.[48]The first trailer was released on October 1, 2020, confirming that several of BaronCohen's pranks were shot for this film.[49]
In the two weeks leading up to the film release, Amazon spent $20.4million on marketing.[50]
BaronCohen joined social media outletsInstagram,TikTok, andTwitterin-character as Borat to comment on American politics in the run-up to the election and promote the film release,[51]including congratulatingDonald Trumpfor winning the first of the2020 United States presidential debatesbefore the event began[52]and starting a "feud" withAriana Grande[53]for stealing a cut-out of Borat installed at adrive-in theater.[54]The social media push also involved aTwitch streamplaying video games withDrLupo[55]and meetingYouTubeinfluencers.[56]He also made a return toJimmy Kimmel Live!in character a few days before the film's release.[57]
Amazon Prime UK promoted the film by projecting an image of Borat in an extremely smallmankiniresembling a face mask on the side of several historic sites inScotland.[58]In Australia'sBondi Beach, 40Borat look-alikes descended onto the sands to do a yoga class in the "maskini" gear, accompanied by a large statue.[59]During the second presidential debate, Baron Cohen hosted a watch party to debut the film in-character, followed by an afterparty made up of dance music and questions from fans via a live chat.[60]A further stunt involved a large inflatable Borat floating in a barge along theTorontowaterfront[61]and in front of London'sPalace of Westminster.[62]TheCerne Abbas Giantwas also defaced with a mask and the slogan "WEAR MASK. SAVE LIVE".[63]
Amazon additionally collaborated with YouTube pranksters to trickStephen Bear,Jimmy Carr,Perrie Edwards,David Spade,David Walliams, andAnn Widdecombeinto a false audition for a thirdBoratfilm, convincing them to act as a Kazakhstani ambassador.[64]The company also modified theirAlexaservice to give potato news from Borat.[65]
Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[66]OnRotten Tomatoes, 85% of 306 critics positively reviewed the film, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "Borat Subsequent Moviefilmproves Sacha BaronCohen's comedic creation remains a sharp tool for exposing the most misguided—or outright repugnant—corners of American culture."[67]Most publications said the film received generally positive reviews,[68][69][70][71]though theBBCandReuterssummed up the critical consensus as "mixed".[72][73]
Eric Kohn ofIndieWiregave the film an A− and wrote: "Fourteen years after his last romp, Borat isn't exactly woke, but his time has come: This searing brand of humor has never felt more essential. Blending activism with entertainment, BaronCohen's best movie to date gives us new reasons to be afraid of the world, but also permission to laugh at it."[74]Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film three out of four stars and wrote: "Fourteen years after Kazakhstan journalist Borat came to America to make a documentary about our great nation, he's back in the USA—older, dumber, far more famous and arguably even more politically incorrect and offensively funny than he was in 2006."[75]
InThe Guardian, Peter Bradshaw gave the film three out of five stars, saying "there are still some real laughs and pointed political moments" but that it "overstays its welcome".[76]Jesse Hassenger ofThe A.V. Clubgave the film a B− and called it "frequently funny and occasionally pointed" but "also another instance where doing things as they've always been done no longer feels like quite enough".[77]Similarly, Devika Girish ofThe New York Timesnotes how the sequel is not as shocking or insightful as the first film, summing up, "[the] elaborate ruses ofBorat Subsequent Moviefilmleft me neither entertained nor enraged, but simply resigned".[78]
In a review forThe Daily Telegraph,Robbie Collinawarded the film two of five stars, calling the film "despairingly threadbare" and "a string of half-formed, recycled and disjointed pranks you suspect wouldn't have survived the quality-control process on the original, effortfully connected post hoc by largely uninspired scripted scenes."[79]LongtimeChicago Tribunefilm columnistMichael Philipsgave the film two stars, calling the sequel "ruder" and "more sentimental" than its predecessor. Phillips summarized his reaction as having "laughed at a good deal of the movie, but a good deal more of it left [him] with (Cohen's  [sic] intention, probably) the taste of ashes in the mouth".[80]Alonso DuraldeofThe Wrapnegatively reviewed the movie, believing it "valiantly fails to resuscitate the satire corpse". Duralde, a self-avowed "superfan" of the first film, writes that "the sequel might (in, one hopes, a happier future) be hilarious in retrospect, but at the moment, it's a mostly cringe-worthy experience".[81]
Unlike the reception of the first Borat movie, which was denounced by the Kazakh state as a libellous smear against the people of Kazakhstan,[93]and resulted in threatened legal action against Cohen and his distributors, the release of the sequel received a more mixed reception. The Kazakh American Association denounced the film for promoting racism, cultural appropriation and xenophobia.[94]On the other hand, the tourism board of Kazakhstan has appropriated a key catchphrase, "very nice", to promote the advantages of visiting Kazakhstan, capitalizing on the increased public interest in Kazakhstan as a result of the first film.[94]
Rudy Giulianiwas criticized for his actions in a scene in which he slides his hand into the top of his trousers in front of actress Maria Bakalova, who is impersonating a journalist. Following an interview in a hotel room, the pair retreat to the bedroom, where Giuliani's voice is heard (facing away from the camera) asking for an address and phone number. After Bakalova removes his microphone, thus untucking his shirt, Giuliani lies back on the bed and tucks his shirt back in. BaronCohen then bursts into the room exclaiming "She 15! She too old for you!"[76][95]Giuliani denied allegations of impropriety, claiming that the allegations were a smear for Giuliani'sHunter Biden laptop controversydespite the scene having been filmed months before the controversy occurred.[96]
Controversy over what happened in the scene led BaronCohen to record a brief clip as Borat regarding Giuliani.[97]In an out of character interview, BaronCohen remarked, "Heaven knows what he's done with other female journalists in hotel rooms," and stood by the accuracy of the scene: "It is what it is. He did what he did."[98]While on the campaign trail,Donald Trumpcalled BaronCohen unfunny and "a creep".[99]BaronCohen thanked him for the remarks.[100]The debate followed Giuliani in subsequent media appearances, such as whenFox NewsanchorKennedyconfronted him about the scene as well as the veracity of the Biden emails.[101]BaronCohen continued the feud by mocking Giuliani'sFour Seasons Total Landscaping press conference[102]and rescinding an earlier job offer to Trump for being a loser in the2020 United States presidential election.[103]
The film's creators were sued forfraudafter including an interview withHolocaust survivorJudith Dim Evans. Evans died before the film's release, but her heirs brought the lawsuit alleging that she did not consent to the commercial use of her likeness in the film.[104][105]BaronCohen—who dedicated the film to her memory—claimed that hebroke characterto address Evans's concerns about Borat's anti-Semitic comments, revealing the satirical nature of the piece.[106]The lawsuit was dismissed on October26.[107]
TheNew York Postreported that babysitter Jeanise Jones felt "betrayed" by the filmmakers who told her that she was going to be in a documentary about a young woman being groomed to marry an older man;[108]she did not find out the true nature of the film until the day before it was released.[109]She later disputed that statement, saying that she was not angry at the filmmakers,[110]and that it was her fault for not reading the release papers.[111]When asked if her $3600 payment for her appearance seemed fair, Jones replied that "I can't say it was fair because they knew it was going to be a movie, and I didn't." Acclaiming her as the "moral compass" of the film and mentioning that she was unemployed as a result of COVID layoffs, aGoFundMecampaign started by Jones's pastor raised over $50,000 for her in three days[112]and more than $150,000 by the end of the week.[113][114]BaronCohen donated $100,000 to her community ofOklahoma City, with funds disbursed by her church.[115]Jones was cast as an angel in a comedy film as a result of her appearance inBorat Subsequent Moviefilm.[116]Maria Bakalova revealed in January 2021 that she has kept in touch with Jones.[117]
"The humor of Borat is incomprehensible to the majority of people in Kazakhstan, although the film is somewhat funny... At least people look on the map to find out if this is a real country but there are also negative consequences. A friend of mine who lives in the United States told me that Americans of Kazakh origin began to experience bullying."
The character of Borat has been controversial in Kazakhstan,[119]with the original film being censored for a period and BaronCohen's website blocked in the country. In the lead-up to the sequel,Kazakhstook to Twitter with thehashtag#CancelBorat.[120]An online petition urging the film to be canceled garnered over 100,000 signatures and small protests gathered in front of the American embassy inAlmatythe day of the premiere.[121]Kazakhs and Westerners alike renewed criticism that the character uses comedy to "punch down" by picking on the more marginalized Kazakhs by arbitrarily mocking their accents and stereotyping them,[122]and the Kazakh American Association issued a letter alleging that the film promotes "racism, cultural appropriation, and xenophobia";[123]in the lead up to thefilm awards seasons, they issued a second letter asking organizations to not consider the film.[124]The character has created misperceptions of Kazakhstan.[125]Nevertheless, the national tourism agency Kazakh Tourism capitalized on the renewed international attention the film brought by adopting Borat's catchphrase as its slogan—Kazakhstan. Very Nice!—and produced a number of videos featuring it.[126]
Marketing for the film drew ire from the BritishNational Trustfor defacing theCerne Abbas Giant[127]and from Parisian Muslims who objected to posters of the near-nude Borat evidently wearing a ring with "Allah" inscribed on it;[128]the posters were removed.[129]
Following the film's first weekend,Amazon, Inc.declined to give precise numbers for the number of viewers but stated that it was "tens of millions" globally. Estimates bySamba TVput the number of U.S. households who watched during that first weekend at 1.6 million;[130]Amazon claims these numbers are inaccurate.[1]Based onsocial mediamentions, MarketCast tracked 1.1million hits across the week leading up to and just following the film's release; that left it second only toHamiltonin mentions in 2020.[131]Nielsen ratingsfor streaming in the week of October19 placedBorat Subsequent Moviefilmat the eighth most-watched program, with 570million minutes, the equivalent to 5.9million viewings.[132]In November,Varietyreported the film was the second-most watched straight-to-streaming title of 2020 up to that point.[133]
In April 2021, the follow-up miniseries,Borat 2: Supplemental Reportingsfeaturing deleted scenes fromSubsequent Moviefilmwas announced.[134]On May 24, 2021, Amazon Prime released the video shortBorat: VHS Cassette of Material Deemed 'Sub-acceptable' by Kazakhstan Ministry of Censorship and Circumcision, and seven-episode miniseries,Borat's American Lockdown & Debunking Borat,[135]featuring additional unrelated footage shot during production ofBorat Subsequent Moviefilm, including more of his quarantine lockdown with Jim and Jerry. It also features a rare clip of BaronCohen breaking character while still in costume, from when theBoratcrew was chased away from the gun rally in Washington: BaronCohen is clearly shown giving warnings to his crew as they evacuate in their hired ambulance.
In January 2021, Baron Cohen toldVarietythat there are no plans for a third movie, saying, "There was a purpose to this movie, and I don't really see the purpose to doing it again. So yeah, he's locked away in the cupboard."[136]
In February 2021, Baron Cohen revealed he intended to retire the character of Borat because of risks to his personal safety, feeling anxious over the March for Our Rights scene fromBorat 2.[137]

His writing work includes collaborations with comedy figures such asArmando Iannucci,Steve Coogan,Chris Morris,Sacha Baron Cohen, andSarah Smith. Born inCardiff, Baynham served in theMerchant Navyafter leaving school and later pursued a career in comedy — first in stand-up, and then as a writer and performer for various news and sketch comedies in radio and television while enjoying personal fame starring in Pot Noodle adverts. He then became a writer in feature film.
In television, with Iannucci he is writer forI'm Alan Partridge, developing the characterAlan Partridgeas performed by Coogan, and as writer and host of theArmisticereview shows. With Morris, he is writer forThe Day Today,Brass Eye, andJam. Baynham himself created the animated seriesI Am Not an Animal. In feature film, with Baron Cohen he is writer forBorat!

Other features as writer includeArthur(2011) andHotel Transylvania(2012).
Baynham was born and raised inCardiffas the second of four children. He attended St Mary's primary school inCanton, thenLady Mary RC High SchoolinCyncoed. Baynham said he found school difficult, finding himself shy, "weedy", and unpopular. He found himself too unathletic to enjoyrugby, despite expectations from his father.[1]He left school with eightO-Levels, four with an "A" grade, and joined theMerchant Navyat age 16 with a desire to travel the world.[1][2][3]Baynham described his experience in the Merchant Navy as unsuited to his character, he said "I was with men who drank beer for breakfast. A lot of them were fascist, and I mean really fascist. They say travel should broaden the mind but these blokes would have been kicked out of theKu Klux Klanfor being too extreme".[1]Duties included performing operations on a chemical tanker while wearing ahazmat suit. He reflected, "I'm small and would basically float around inside the suit like a confusedfoetus, trying to pick up spanners and operate awalkie-talkie".[4]Baynham is qualified to navigate asupertanker.[5]After five years, he was made redundant due to government cuts in defence. He went on to serve assecond mateon a private yacht inMonte Carloas a summer job.[1]
In 1987 he moved to London with his brother and worked selling advertising space inThe Guardiannewspaper. He began attending a comedy workshop,The Comedy Store.[1][2]He became a stand-up comedian, and created the character Mr Buckstead, a psychotic teacher and poet.[5]Baynham said the act consisted of "[talking] about the terrible things he did to his pupils". During this period he financially supported himself with self-employment income under theEnterprise Allowance Scheme, his redundancy cheque from Merchant Navy, and a bank loan that was nominally meant for buying a car. He earned around £20 (GBP) per gig, and made £4,500 in his first year. To additionally support himself, he wrote sketches for the topical radio comedyWeek Ending. He earned £18 for each minute of material, and contributed around two minutes of material each week. After four years he felt his stand-up career was not progressing, and decided to commit to radio.[1]He became cast for the comedy sketch radio seriesFist of Fun.[6][7]
Aiming to break into television, Baynham wrote one-liner jokes for a Friday night show presented byTerry Wogan. He was unimpressed by Wogan's delivery of the jokes.[1]Baynham, working at theBBCoffices, encounteredArmando Iannucciwhile looking for photocopier paper. Iannucci would introduce him toChris Morris, who was creating the news satireThe Day Today. Although Morris was not interested in accepting more writers for the project, he was made a writer after Morris was impressed by a sketch he wrote that involved horses infesting theLondon Underground.[2]He also appears in a sketch as a reporter named Colin Poppshed who presented "Gay News", where he farcically announces the gayness of various "roads, periodic table elements, cars, and walls".[8]He also became a guest and contributor for the radio seriesThe Chris Morris Music Show; he was suspended by the BBC for two weeks for conceiving a joke where Morris falsely implies on air thatMichael Heseltinehad died. Baynham stated that Morris technically did not announce his death, and had only said "if there is any news of Michael Heseltine's death in the next hour, we'll let you know".[2]Other radio work included being cast forLee and Herring.[5]
Baynham became a writer for the sitcomI'm Alan Partridge, a spin-off of the comedy characterAlan Partridgeas performed bySteve CooganinThe Day Today, an incompetent sports reporter progressed as a tactless and self-satisfied television personality. He thought that Alan Partridge was underdeveloped because the format ofThe Day Todaymade him "bracketed and contained within presenting to [the] camera". Here he would realise Alan Partridge as a "three-dimensional" character. He, with the writing team, appliedworldbuilding, such as establishing the geography of Alan Partridge's residence of "Linton Travel Tavern".[9]Coogan credited Baynham for making Alan Partridge more human and sympathetic.[2]Baynham described his work onI'm Alan Partridgeas a highly productive and enjoyable period of his career, saying "It's my happiest, most fun writing experience ever really, it was just so exciting".[9]
In the same period,Fist of Funtransferred to television where Baynham makes an on-screen appearance of his character "Peter", a "stinking 32-year-old Welsh virgin".[3][10]He also served as writer and host of theArmisticenews review shows.[1][3][11]Baynham created and performed the character "Terry fromPontypridd" in a popular television advertising campaign forPot Noodle, promoted with the catchphrase "they're too gorgeous". The campaign propelled him to unexpected fame; he reported that strangers would shout "gorgeous" at him in public, and that a university student threw a Pot Noodle at him on stage while touring withLee and Herring.[1][12][13][14]Other television work includeBrass Eyewith Morris, notably as writer for the controversial special "Paedogeddon!" that attracted widespread media attention for its comedic portrayal ofpaedophilia.[2][15]Other credits include writer for episodes ofBob and Margaret,[16]and writing additional material for the sketch showBig Train.[17]He served as writer for the radio seriesBlue Jam, which transferred to television asJam.[5]He also became a guest for the radio comedy game showThe 99p Challenge.[5]
He became writer for the animated sketch comedyMonkey Dust.[5][16]He created the animated black comedyI am Not an Animal, which follows a group of intelligent talking animals who escape avivisectionlaboratory.[5][16]
Baynham felt uncertain about his future in television afterI Am Not an Animalwas poorly received by BBC executives, one of whom told him, "I won't be paying a return visit to this". Meanwhile, he received a phone call fromSacha Baron Cohenwho asked him if he could help continue his faltering feature film project he had been working on based on the comedy characterBorat. Baynham replied that he was not interested because he was working on creating his own sitcom, but then changed his mind and phoned Baron Cohen later that day expressing interest, and became writer for the 2006 filmBorat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.[2]After the success ofBorat, he continued his collaboration with Baron Cohen and became writer for the 2009 filmBrüno.[18]
Under directorJason Winerhe became writer for the 2011 filmArthur, a recreation ofthe 1981 filmstarringRussell Brand.[19]
Earlier, in 2005, Baynham conceived of a Christmas story whereSanta Claushas an "impractical and useless" son, and collaborated withSarah SmithatAardman Animationsto write a screenplay for the 2011 filmArthur Christmas.[20]The story deals with Santa's global operation to deliver presents to every child, which Baynham said he considered with "pedantic" detail, such as what would be mathematically possible in 12 hours with one million elves and a mile wide spaceship.[21]
Under directorGenndy Tartakovskyhe became writer for the 2012 animated filmHotel Transylvania.[22]
Baynham collaborated with Iannucci and Coogan again to create a feature film based on Alan Partridge, and became writer for the 2013 filmAlan Partridge: Alpha Papa.[13]
With Baron Cohen again he became writer for the 2016 filmGrimsby,[23]and continued this collaboration as writer for the 2020 filmBorat Subsequent Moviefilm, a sequel to the previousBoratfilm.[2]
In 2021, Baynham - along with close friend and long-time collaborator Jeremy Simmonds - launched the surreal comedy podcastBrain Cigar. This has so far run to six episodes and a 'Christmas special'.[24]
James Rampton writing forThe Independentdescribed him as "an anonymous foot-soldier in Armando Iannucci's all-conquering comedy army".[3]Brendon Connelley writing for/Filmsaid, "Baynham isn't exactly comedy royalty in the UK — more like a secret power behind the thrones".[19]Baynham himself reflected, "It feels quite cool, in a mad way, to be someone who skulks about in the shadows".[15]Kathryn Williams forWalesOnlineargued that he "revolutionised both topical satire and character comedy in the 1990s", along with Iannucci, Coogan, and Morris.[11]
Baynham settled inLos Angelesafter completingBorat.[2]He is a citizen of the United States.[25]

Baron Cohen was first educated at the independent CatholicSt Columba's CollegeinSt Albans, before moving on to attend the independentHaberdashers' Aske's Boys' SchoolinElstree.[21]He then studied history with a focus onantisemitismatChrist's College, Cambridge, graduating in 1993 withupper-second-class honours.[22][23][14]As an undergraduate, he wrote his thesis on the role of Jewish activists in theAmerican civil rights movement.[24]He was a member of theCambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club, where he performed in shows such asFiddler on the RoofandCyrano de Bergerac, as well as acted in shows with theLabouryouth movementHabonim Dror.[25]He played the cello while growing up, and made his television debut as a cellist onFanfare for Young Musicians.[14]
Baron Cohen grew up as a fan ofMonty PythonandPeter Cook, but his greatest comedic influence wasPeter Sellers, whom he saw as "this incredibly realistic actor, who was also hilarious and who managed to bridge the gap between comedy and satire".[26][27]Known for portraying a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, Sellers was referred to by Baron Cohen as "the most seminal force in shaping [his] early ideas on comedy".[28]After leaving university, Baron Cohen worked for a time as a fashion model.[25]By the early 1990s, he was hosting a weekly programme on Windsor cable television's local broadcasts withCarol Kirkwood, who later became aBBCweather forecaster. In 1995,Channel 4was planning a replacement for its seriesThe Word, and disseminated an open call for new television presenters. Baron Cohen sent in a tape of himself, which caught the attention of a producer. Baron Cohen hostedPump TVfrom 1995 to 1996.
In 1996, Baron Cohen began presenting the youth chat programmeF2FforGranada Talk TVand had a small role in an advertisement for McCain Microchips, as a chef in a commercial entitled "Ping Pong".[29]He took clown training in Paris, at theÉcole Philippe Gaulier, studying under master-clownPhilippe Gaulier. Of his former pupil, Gaulier says: "He was a good clown, full of spirit"[30]while Baron Cohen remarks of Gaulier, "Without him, I really do doubt whether I would have had any success in my field".[31]He left TV journalistRob Burleya note reading "Dear Rob, good luck baby, have fun and things, see you soon, Sacha.", when Burley left the programme.[32]Baron Cohen made his first feature film appearance in the British comedyThe Jolly Boys' Last Stand(2000). Also in 2000, he played the part ofSuper Gregfor a series of TV advertisements forLee Jeans; the advertisements never aired, but the website for Super Greg created an internet sensation.[33]
Baron Cohen appeared during two-minute sketches as his fashion reporterBrünoon theParamount Comedy Channelduring 1998. He shot to fame with his comic character Ali G, a fictional stereotype of a British suburban male "chav" who imitates urbanblackBritish hip hopculture andBritish Jamaicanculture, as well as speaking inrude boy-styleEnglish with borrowed expressionsfromJamaican Patois. Hailing fromStaines(a suburban town in Surrey, to the west of London), Ali G started appearing on the British television showThe 11 O'Clock ShowonChannel 4, which first aired on 8 September 1998. A year after the première of the show,GQnamed Baron Cohen comedian of the year.[34]He won Best Newcomer at the 1999British Comedy Awards, and at theBritish Academy Television Awardshe was nominated for Best British Entertainment Performance.[34]
Da Ali G Showbegan in 2000, and won theBAFTAforBest Comedyin the following year.[35]Also in 2000, Baron Cohen as Ali G appeared as the limousine driver inMadonna's 2000 video "Music", directed byJonas Åkerlund, who was also responsible for directing the titles forDa Ali G Show. Baron Cohen is a supporter of the UK charity telethonComic Relief, which is broadcast on the BBC, and as Ali G interviewedDavid Beckhamand wifeVictoriain 2001.[36]
In a 2001 Channel 4 poll Ali G was ranked eighth on their list of the100 Greatest TV Characters.[37][38]In 2002, Ali G was the central character in the feature filmAli G Indahouse, in which he is elected to theBritish Parliamentand foils a plot to bulldoze a community centre in his home town, Staines.[39]His television show was exported to the United States in 2003, with new episodes set there, forHBO.
At the 2012 British Comedy Awards, 13 years after winning Best Newcomer at the 1999 Comedy Awards, Baron Cohen accepted the Outstanding Achievement Award from SirBen Kingsleyin the guise of Ali G, and stated: "I is grown up now. I ain't living in my nan's house any more. I is living in her garage."[40]In 2013, he received the BAFTACharlie ChaplinBritannia Awardfor Excellence in Comedy.[41]
Ali G's interviews with notable figures (especially politicians) gained notoriety partly because the subjects were not aware that Ali G, rather than being a real interviewer, was a comedic character. According toRolling Stonemagazine, Baron Cohen would always enter the interview area dressed as Ali G, carrying equipment while acting like an inconspicuous crew member. The crew would be accompanied by a man in a suit and tie, leading the subject to believe that this was the person who would interview them. Baron Cohen, as Ali G, would sit down to ask the interviewee some preliminary questions to give them the impression that this was a test run before the well-dressed man conducted the real interview; this continued until a few moments before the cameras started filming, revealing the suited man as the director and Ali G as the interviewer, granting Baron Cohen the element of surprise as the interviewee would be less likely to opt out of the interview so close to its start.[42]
The Kazakh journalist Borat Sagdiyev was first developed for short skits onF2FonGranada Televisionin the UK that Baron Cohen presented in 1996–1997, with the character at this time being known as Alexi Krickler.[43]The character remained dormant while Baron Cohen concentrated on his Ali G persona, but with the subsequent success of Ali G, Baron Cohen revisited his Borat character. The character was featured in segments ofDa Ali G Show.[44]Borat's sense of humour derives from his mocking of society through outrageous sociocultural viewpoints, hisdeadpanviolation of social taboos and use of vulgar language and behaviour.[45][46]
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, a feature film with Borat Sagdiyev at the centre, was screened at the2006 Toronto International Film Festivaland released in the United Kingdom on 2 November 2006, in the United States on 3 November 2006 and Australia 23 November 2006. The film follows Sagdiyev as he and his colleagueAzamat Bagatovtravel the US to produce a documentary about life in the country, as all the while Sagdiyev attempts to enter into marriage with celebrityPamela Anderson. The film is amockumentarywhich includes interviews with various Americans that poke fun atAmerican culture, as well assexism,racism,homophobia,antisemitismandjingoism. It debuted at the No. 1 spot in the US, taking in an estimated $26.4 million in just 837 theatres averaging $31,600 per theatre.[47]
Baron Cohen won the 2007Golden GlobeforBest Actor – Musical or Comedy, his sixth such award. Although Borat was up for "Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy", the film lost toDreamgirls. On 23 January 2007, he was nominated for anAcademy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He shared his nomination with the film's co-writers, Ant Hines,Peter Baynham,Dan MazerandTodd Phillips.
Aside from the comic elements of his characters, Baron Cohen's performances are interpreted by some as reflecting uncomfortable truths about his audience. He juxtaposes his own Jewish heritage with the anti-Semitism of his character Borat.[48]
In 2007, Baron Cohen published a travel guide as Borat, with dual titles:Borat: Touristic Guidings To Minor Nation of U.S. and A.andBorat: Touristic Guidings To Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.[49]On 21 December 2007, Baron Cohen announced he was retiring the character of Borat.[50]After the release ofBorat, Baron Cohen said he would retire Borat and Ali G because the public had become too familiar with the characters.[51]After the release ofBrüno, he said he would retire that character.[52]
The character was brought back on a 2018 appearance onJimmy Kimmel Liveand appears in the 2020 sequelBorat Subsequent Moviefilm, for which he won another Golden Globe Award, as well as the 2022Kennedy Center Honorswhere he did a standup routine as Borat for the induction ofU2.[53]
Another alter ego Sacha Baron Cohen performed as is "Brüno", a flamboyantly gay Austrian fashion show presenter who often lures his unwitting subjects into making provocative statements and engaging in embarrassing behaviour, as well as leading them to contradict themselves, often in the same interview. Brüno's main comedic satire pertains to the vacuity and inanity of the fashion andclubbingworld. Brüno asks the subjects to answer "yes or no" questions with either "Vassup" (What's up) or "Ich don't think so" (I don't think so); these are occasionally substituted with "Ach, ja!" (Ah yes!) or "Nicht, nicht" ("Nicht" means "no" or "not" in German). In one segment onDa Ali G Show, he encouraged his guest to answer questions with either "Keep them in the ghetto" or "Train toAuschwitz".
In May 2009, at theMTV Movie Awards, Baron Cohen appeared as Brüno wearing a white angel costume, a whitejockstrap, whitego-go boots, and white wings; and did an aerial stunt where he dropped from a height (using wires) ontoEminem. Baron Cohen landed with his face on Eminem's crotch and with his crotch in Eminem's face, prompting Eminem to exit the venue with fellow rappersD12. Eminem later admitted to staging the stunt with Baron Cohen.[54]
After an intense bidding war that included such Hollywood powerhouses asDreamWorks,Sony, and20th Century Fox,Universal Pictureswon and paid a reported $42.5 million for thefilm rightsto a collection of interviews Baron Cohen performed as the character Brüno.[55]To create these interviews a number ofshillcompanies and websites were created to draw potential interviewees by creating an illusion of legitimacy.[56]The filmwas released in July 2009.
Baron Cohen's 2012 film,The Dictator, was described by its press as "the heroic story of a dictator who risked his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed".[57]Baron Cohen played Admiral General Aladeen, a dictator from a fictional country called the Republic of Wadiya.[58][59]BoratandBrünofilm directorLarry Charlesdirected the film.[60]The main target of the film's satire was Libyan dictatorMuammar Gaddafi, who was still alive when the film was written.[61]The producers of the film were concerned it would anger Gaddafi, possibly even resulting in a terrorist attack, so they released deliberate misinformation saying that the film was loosely based on a romance novel written by former Iraqi dictatorSaddam Hussein.[61]
On 26 February 2012, Baron Cohen claimed he was banned from attending the84th Academy Awardsin his role as Admiral General Aladeen but the rumour was denied by the Academy, saying "we haven't banned him, he is lying" but made it clear that "Cohen is not welcome to use the red carpet as a platform for a promotional stunt".[62]Baron Cohen eventually appeared at the awards' red carpet with a pair ofuniformed female bodyguards, holding anurnwhich he claimed was filled with the ashes ofKim Jong-il. The "ashes", which Baron Cohen admitted to Howard Stern on the Tuesday, 8 May 2012 episode ofThe Howard Stern Showwas flour, were "accidentally" spilt ontoRyan Seacrest.
Baron Cohen portrays various characters inWho Is America?, including Erran Morad, an Israeli anti-terrorism expert. The character is referred to as a colonel (and later captain, general, major, sergeant, brigadier, sergeant corporal and lieutenant) in theIsraeli militaryand a former agent ofMossad(or "not in the Mossad", as he often interjects). BeforeWho Is America?aired on Showtime, some conservative public figures made statements saying that Baron Cohen had deceived them while in character.[63][64][65]Hours before the premiere, Showtime uploaded the "Kinderguardians" segment on their YouTube channel, in which Morad explains toPhilip Van Cleave, the president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, of the proposal of a new program where children ages 3 to 16 are armed with guns. He also interviews other conservatives, such asDana Rohrabacher,Joe Wilson, andJoe Walsh, who are openly supportive. OnlyMatt Gaetzexpresses skepticism of Morad's proposal and declines to be in his video.
In the second episode, Morad teachesJason Spencer, a Republican state representative from Georgia, how to detect and repel terrorists by taking pictures up a woman's burqa with a selfie stick, walking backwards while baring his buttocks, and yelling racial epithets. After the airing of the episode, Spencer initially refused to step down, stating that he was exploited by the producers.

BoratdirectorLarry Charlesexplains that Baron Cohen generally appears in character partly to "protect his weakness", by focusing public interest on his characters rather than himself.[108]His other reason,Newsweekclaims, is that Baron Cohen is fiercely private: "...according to the UK press, his publicists denied that he attended a party for the London premiere ofBoratand that a party even occurred".[108]
Baron Cohen was featured in theTime 100list for 2007.[109]
Sports Illustrated's6 November 2006 issue contains a column called "Skater vs. Instigator", which illustrates various amusing "parallels" between Baron Cohen and figure skaterSasha Cohen, ranging from their mutually held personal significance of the number 4[110]to their shared romantic interests in redheads.
In 2018,The Timesnamed him among the 30 best living comedians.[111]
Baron Cohen has been criticized for the racist orprejudicedcomments his characters have made. HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer replied to the criticism and said, "Through his alter-egos, [Baron Cohen] delivers an obvious satire that exposes people's ignorance and prejudice in much the same wayAll in the Familydid years ago."[112]Regarding his portrayal as the anti-Semitic Borat, Baron Cohen says the segments are a "dramatic demonstration of how racism feeds on dumb conformity, as much as rabid bigotry" rather than a display of racism by Baron Cohen himself.[113]He said, "Borat essentially works as a tool. By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice."[17]Addressing the same topic in anNPRinterview with Robert Siegel, he said, "People really let down their guard with [Borat] because they're in a room with somebody who seems to have these outrageous opinions. They sometimes feel much more relaxed about letting their own outrageous, politically incorrect, prejudiced opinions come out."[106]Baron Cohen said he also wishes in particular to expose the role of indifference inthe Holocaust: "When I was in university, there was this major historian of theThird Reich,Ian Kershaw, who said, 'The path toAuschwitzwas paved with indifference.' I know it's not very funny being a comedian talking about the Holocaust, but it's an interesting idea that not everyone in Germany had to be a raving anti-Semite. They just had to beapathetic."[17]Regarding the enthusiastic response to his song "In My Country There Is Problem" (also known as "Throw the Jew Down the Well"), he said, "Did it reveal that [the cheering audience] were anti-Semitic? Perhaps. But maybe it just revealed that they were indifferent to anti-Semitism."[17]
In an interview with former Tory MP politicianNeil Hamiltonin 2000, Ali G offered Hamilton what was allegedlycannabis, which Hamilton accepted and smoked, creating some minor controversy in the British media.[114]
The government ofKazakhstanthreatened Baron Cohen with legal action following the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony inLisbon, and the authority in charge of the country's country-codetop-level domainname removed the website that he had created for his character Borat (previously: http://www.borat.kz) for alleged violation of the law—specifically, registering for the domain under a false name.The New York Times, among others, has reported that Baron Cohen (in character as Borat) replied: "I'd like to state that I have no connection with Mr. Cohen and fully support my government decision to sue this Jew".[115]He was, however, defended byDariga Nazarbayeva, a politician and the daughter of Kazakhstan's then-PresidentNursultan Nazarbayev, who stated, "We should not be afraid of humour and we shouldn't try to control everything...".[116]The deputy foreign minister of Kazakhstan later invited Baron Cohen to visit the country, stating that he could learn that "women drive cars, wine is made of grapes, and Jews are free to go to synagogues".[117]After the success of theBoratfilm, the Kazakh government, including the president, altered their stance on Baron Cohen's parody, tacitly recognising the valuable press coverage the controversy created for their country.[118]
At the 2006MTV Movie Awards, Borat introducedGnarls Barkley's performance of "Crazy",[119]where he made a comment aboutJessica Simpson, saying that he liked her mouth and that he couldsee it clearly through her denim pants.[120]
At the 2006 UK premiere ofBorat, he arrived inLeicester Squarein a cart pulled by a mule and a number of "Kazakh women," announcing: "Good evening, gentleman and prostitutes. After this, I stay in a hotel inKings Cross. We will all drink, wrestle with no clothes on and shoot dogs from the window".[121]
Two of the threeUniversity of South Carolinastudents who appear inBoratsued the filmmakers, alleging that they were duped into signing release forms while drunk, and that false promises were made that the footage was for a documentary that would never be screened in the US. On 11 December 2006, a Los Angeles judge denied the pair a restraining order to remove them from the film. The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2007.[122][123]
On 26 September 2008, Baron Cohen walked onto the runway during theÁgatha Ruiz de la Pradafashion show inMilan. In-character as Brüno, he was wearing a costume made ofvelcro. He appeared on the stage with a blanket and items of clothing stuck to his velcro suit. Lights were turned off while security intervened and escorted him off the stage, and the fashion show resumed normally shortly thereafter. Baron Cohen and his team had allegedly accessed the fashion show using fake IDs.[124]
On 22 May 2009, a charity worker at a seniors' bingo game sued Baron Cohen, claiming an incident shot forBrünoat a charity bingo tournament left her disabled.[125]However, the worker later retracted her statement, saying the "actor never struck her", but that he "beat her down emotionally to the point she's now confined to a wheelchair".[126]The scene did not make the final cut for the film. The case was dismissed in late November 2009 onAnti-SLAPPgrounds, with all lawyer's fees to be paid by the charity worker. The dismissal was appealed and upheld on 12 September 2011.[127][128]
On 30 April 2010,Palestinian Christiangrocer Ayman Abu Aita, of theWest Bankand former member ofFatah,filed a lawsuitagainst Baron Cohen, alleging that he had beendefamedby false accusations that he was a terrorist in the movieBruno. Aita includedDavid Lettermanin the suit based on comments made during a 7 July 2009 appearance by Baron Cohen on theLate Show with David Letterman.[129]Unlike the other lawsuits, Aita did not sign a release form, and his case centred around whether Baron Cohen's portrayal of Aita was false, not whether he was defrauded.[130]In September 2012, the defamation claim was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, and the court case was dismissed.[131][132][133]
In 2018, former Senate candidateRoy MooreofAlabamasued Baron Cohen for $95 million relating to a mock interview inWho is America?andallegations of paedophilia.[134][135]On 13 July 2021, theU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Yorkdismissed the lawsuit after finding that Moore had signed a consent agreement barring his claims.[136]Moore has filed notice of his intent to appeal the decision.[137]On 8 July 2022, Baron Cohen defeated the lawsuit.[138]
In June 2020, Baron Cohen crashed theright-wing"March for Our Rights 3" protest inOlympia, Washington, a counter-protest to theMarch for Our Livesdemonstration as a result of theStoneman Douglas High School shooting. Disguised under heavy make-up, Baron Cohen sang a song telling listeners to attackliberals,CNN, theWorld Health Organization,Barack Obama,Hillary Clinton,Anthony Fauci,Bill Gatesand "mask-wearers". The crowd, which initially sang along, realized they were being pranked when counter-protestors recognized Baron Cohen and began laughing. Baron Cohen's security stopped the organizers from taking him off stage and turning off the power, and Baron Cohen was forced to flee in a private ambulance from the crowd.[139][140]The incident was later revealed to have been organized as part of filming forBorat Subsequent Moviefilm, with Baron Cohen in-character as Borat in disguise.[141]
Baron Cohen first met Australian actressIsla Fisherat a party inSydneyin 2001, and they became engaged in 2004.[142]She laterconverted to Judaism,[143]and they were married in aJewish ceremonyon 15 March 2010 inMilanandParis.[144][145][146]They have two daughters (born 2007[147]and 2010)[148]and a son (born 2015).[149][150]They previously divided their time between theMarylebonedistrict of London and theLaurel Canyonneighbourhood of Los Angeles,[151][152]before settling in Sydney.[153][154]On 5 April 2024, they jointly revealed that they had filed for divorce at the end of 2023.[155]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
