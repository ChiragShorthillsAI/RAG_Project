Stuart Heritage ofThe Guardiancalled the film "the sort of thing you'd watch drunk in your house at midnight. But then again, that's how you're going to watch all films for the foreseeable future, so it has to be worth a go."[1]The National's Katy Gillett, in her review of the film, wrote: "If zombie movies are your thing, and you can acknowledge them as pure escapism that isn't to be taken seriously, then you're probably fine. If not, I'd skip it."[7]Alan Ng ofFilm ThreatcalledCorona Zombies"a hilarious satire of this whole pandemic", comparing it favorably to the 1966 filmWhat's Up, Tiger Lily?and the television seriesMystery Science Theater 3000.[8]

Full Moon Featuresis an American independentmotion pictureproduction and distribution company headed byB-movieveteranCharles Band. It is known for thedirect-to-videoseriesPuppet Master,Trancers, andSubspecies, as well as the filmCastle Freakand the VideoZone featurette through 1989 to 2013.[citation needed]
After the collapse of Band's previous film studioEmpire Pictures, he moved back to the United States from Rome and opened Full Moon Productions. Band's goal with Full Moon was to create low-budgethorror,sci-fi, andfantasyfilms while retaining a somewhat "big-budget" look. In the United States, Canada, and several foreign territories, from the company's very humble beginnings, Full Moon teamed withParamount PicturesandPioneer Home Entertainmentfordirect-to-videoreleasing onVHSandLaserDiscand the first release was the feature film directed byDavid Schmoeller,Puppet Masterin 1989, and designed to create the company under the umbrella of Bandcompany, Inc.[1]
Puppet Masterturned out to be a huge hit for Full Moon. Following the film on VHS and LaserDisc was a featurette entitledNo Strings Attached, which documents the making ofPuppet Master. It then featured interviews with cast and crew members, including actorPaul Le Matand Charles Band himself. The next three releases—Shadowzone,Meridian: Kiss of the Beast, andCrash and Burn(changing to Full Moon Entertainment with the release of the latter)—all featured a making-of presentation after the film. Paramount, however, didn't believe in the making-of concept and forced Band to pay for all of the additional tape needed. At the same time, Band also reissued two catalog titles,Tourist TrapandParasitethrough Paramount.
Some controversy arose, however, many years after the release ofPuppet Master. In an interview on the website The Terror Trap,Puppet Masterdirector, David Schmoeller, says that Charles Band owes him residuals, as well as stating that Charles Band doesn't give credit to directors. Schmoeller continues, saying that Band didn't want him on the director's commentary on theDVDrelease ofPuppet Master, because "it would reveal that someone else shared in the creation of Full Moon's biggest and most successful franchise."[2]
With the fifth Full Moon releasePuppet Master IIin 1991, Full Moon introduced VideoZone, a behind-the-scenes video magazine. The average VideoZone featured an introduction by Charles Band, the making-of the "movie you just watched," an interview with someone involved in a future Full Moon release, merchandise (such as Full Moon T-shirts, posters and other assorted goods), trailers, and contact information. VideoZone tied together the "comic bookfeel" that Band insisted with the Full Moon product. In 1992, Full Moon decided to expand into theatrical film production, with a distribution agreement atParamount Pictures, to release two films, but it was never materialized.[3]
Full Moon continued producing its releases throughout the early '90s (sometimes as many as twelve releases a year) and in 1993 founded two more labels:Torchlight Entertainment, specializing insoftcore pornographicsci-ficomediesandMoonbeam Entertainment, specializing in family orientated sci-fi and fantasy films. Torchlight's first release wasBeach Babes From Beyond; Moonbeam's wasPrehysteria!, which actually became a high seller for distributor Paramount and was one of the first Full Moon films to be sold as an inexpensivesell-throughproduct (as most Full Moon features were sold on VHS as rental items with prices upwards of $100 for each tape). Full Moon has also set up the Moonstone Records, and film and trading cards based on the company's own properties.[3]
In 1995, due to the direct-to-video market losing interest and financial ground with therental marketin addition to internal issues, Full Moon Entertainment separated from distributor Paramount. Full Moon'sHalloween1995 productionCastle Freakwas released on video unrated.[4]Castle Freakwas eventually released in November 1995 in both R-rated and unrated versions.[5][6]
After the releases ofCastle FreakandOblivion 2: Backlash, Band renamed Full Moon Entertainment, Full Moon Studios for the featureVampire Journalsand used the name Full Moon Pictures for the following filmHideous!. Band continued to distribute all films on his own under then name ofAmazing Fantasy Entertainmentuntil around 1999 when some of the films were distributed byThe Kushner-Locke Company. In 1997, Bobby Young, who had joined Full Moon two years earlier, has left to start Dominion Entertainment.[7]
With the release ofShriekerin 1998, Band enlisted the help ofOhio-basedfilmmakerandTempe Entertainmentfounder,J. R. Bookwalter, who had recently relocated toCalifornia. Bookwalter was commissioned by Band to begin editing features, includingCurse of the Puppet Master.Curse of the Puppet Masterwas created primarily out of market demand and isn't held in high regard with fans of the genre. To conserve costs (as most Full Moon features were being made for much less than the Paramount-distributed films), the film was put together using footage from the first fivePuppet Masterfiles, as well as some new footage. However, Bookwalter's work got Full Moon noticed onApple.comwhere a story was published about Bookwalter's editing ofCurse of the Puppet Masteron hisiBookin a hotel room in Ohio.
Over the next several years, Full Moon continued its releases and even introduced more labels:
Bookwalter would eventually get the chance to direct a Full Moon film with the sequel toWitchouse,Witchouse 2: Blood Coven. It was Bookwalter's first film on35 mmand with it opened a new door for Bookwalter'sTempe Entertainment.
Starting withHorror Vision,Tempe Entertainmentwas hired to produce several Full Moon films for Band. All of these films were shot onDV, a first for Full Moon and were primarily made for under $60,000 (withWitchouse 3: Demon Firecompleted for $26,000). The films were produced under very tight schedules, some being shot in as little as nine days. While the production drawbacks were high in each situation, this opportunity gave new exposure to Bookwalter and Tempe who was accustomed to producing films on shoestring budgets. On January 16, 2001, Full Moon decided to launch a TV show withWilliam Shatnerattached as host, presenting various Full Moon pictures.[8]
Once again, the industry changed and Band decided to end the Full Moon label with the 2002 release ofJigsaw. In 2001, Full Moon decided to bow out of theatrical distribution, and decided to focus back to straight-to-video films.[9]
During this era of Full Moon, Band secured a weeklytelevision serieson theSci Fi ChannelcalledWilliam Shatner's Full Moon Fright Night. Veteran actor,William Shatner, hosted Full Moon films with wraparounds, as well as interviews with many of sci-fi's most notable personalities, includingStan LeeandJeffrey Combs. Tempe also received exposure here asHorrorVisionwas included in this short-lived series.
With the release of 2000'sThe Dead Hate the Living!, Band dropped the VideoZone name and produced behind-the-scenes featurettes without a masthead.
Blockbuster Entertainment, a longtime supporter of the Full Moon brand requested the company produce aslasher film, due to the late '90s resurgence of this subgenre, thanks toScreamandI Know What You Did Last Summer. With the help of an uncredited Tempe Entertainment, Band producedBleedand acquiredKeith Walley'sScared, renaming itCut Throat.
Band produced only two more films "officially" under the Shadow name: (Birthrite,Delta Delta Die!). Another Keith Walley filmSpeckwas acquired.William Shatner's DV science-fiction movieGroom Lake, produced by J. R. Bookwalter became notorious as one of the most-expensive films of the modern era of Full Moon.
Band also decided around this time to bring back an old label used in the Empire era namedWizard Video, which distributedcult-like films. This modern rendition saw the release of Tempe'sSkinned AliveandOzone(renamedStreet Zombiesfor the Wizard release). However, due to low sales, another Tempe filmBloodletting(which was also renamed:I've Killed Before) was dropped from the release schedule.
In 2003, Charles Band entered into a deal with20th Century Foxto produce a low budget horror movie. Fox would distribute the movie and Band would retain copyrights. The film was directed by J. R. Bookwalter and namedDeadly Stingers.In the tradition of the giant killer bug movies,Deadly Stingerswas about giant scorpions taking over a town. However, after the film was completed, it was shelved due to a decline in the industry and low sales of another similar project at Fox (excluding Full Moon) entitledDark Wolf. The film was shown at the Frightvision Horror Festival in 2003, but while it has surfaced on Full Moon Streaming as of December 2013 under the name ofMega Scorpions, it has yet to see a release on DVD orBlu-ray.[1]A teaser trailer for the film does exist on J. R. Bookwalter'sTempe Entertainmentwebsite.
In late 2003, Band began work on his first 35 mm film in years,Dr. Moreau's House of Pain. The film released in January 2004 also marked the official return of the nameFull Moon Pictures. However, while the film's video releases all contain the name of Shadow Entertainment, the film's trailer contains theFull Moon Pictureslogo.
Quickly before the release ofDr. Moreau's House of Pain, Full Moon releasedPuppet Master: The Legacy, a "greatest hits" film that contained the best scenes from all (hitherto) sevenPuppet Masterfilms with about 20 minutes of a wrap-around story and very bad puppet effects (string rods can be seen in almost every scene featuring the puppets). Once again, all video releases said Shadow Entertainment, but the trailer featured the Full Moon Pictures logo.
On the heels ofPuppet Master: The Legacy, Band quickly cut togetherTomb of Terror,Horrific, andUrban Evil. These three films edited byHorrorVisiondirector, Danny Draven, wereclip showsthat showed off the best in Full Moon's library.
After the release of those films, Band re-christened the Full Moon name to Full Moon Features. Full Moon Features intends to take more time making films with considerably higher budgets and on35 mm filmand as of July 2006 has focused on that with the exceptions ofWhen Puppets and Dolls Attack!,Monsters Gone Wild!, andAliens Gone Wild!(all clip shows).
In 2005, Charles Band embarked on the Full Moon Horror Roadshow, a traveling, live Full Moon-inspired show featuring Band and actors/actresses from past Full Moon films. Some shows also featured his son,Alex Band. At all shows, Band offered a contest for a chance for a member of the audience to have a part in a future Full Moon feature. As of 2009, none of these winners had received their roles. However, on August 27, 2009, Band blogged that those who were chosen would have the opportunity to be cast in his next project.[10]Band continued the roadshow in 2006, this time putting it in smaller venues. A similar contest offering a part in a movie was held at these events. In 2011, contest winners were contacted for the chance to be extras in the movieGingerdead Man 3: Saturday Night Cleaver. Available winners who could make it to the set were featured as extras in the movie during a mass electrocution scene at a roller rink. Full Moon uploaded pictures of the contest winners onset on its official Facebook page.[11]
In 2009, Band hopes to expand Full Moon to a similar release schedule more like the mid-1990s with a new release every month. Additionally, the company plans to add sequels to many franchises, includingPuppet Master,Demonic Toys, andHead of the Family.
In 2012, the Videozone was brought back, making its return on the DVD release ofPuppet Master X: Axis Rising. In addition, the Moonbeam Entertainment brand label was revived under the nameMoonbeam Films.
The studio's nearly thirty-year history is covered in the bookIt Came From the Video Aislewritten by Dave Jay, William S. Wilson, and Torsten Dewi and published bySchiffer Publishingin October 2017.

The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as apattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction ofUna and the Lion(pictured)byWilliam Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at theSydney Mint.

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
