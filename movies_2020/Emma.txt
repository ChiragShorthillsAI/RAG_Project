InRegencyEngland, the wealthy and beautiful twenty-year-oldEmma Woodhouselives with her widowed father at his Hartfield estate in the Surrey village of Highbury. A frequent visitor to Hartfield isGeorge Knightly, a close friend of the family and owner of nearby Donwell Abbey. George is the brother of John Knightly, the husband of Emma's sister Isabella who lives in London.
Emma prides herself on her matchmaking skills, and successfully arranges the marriage of her old governess, Miss Taylor, to Mr Weston. She befriends Harriet Smith, a naive young woman of uncertain parentage who boards at a local girls' school, and persuades her to decline a marriage proposal from a respectable farmer, Robert Martin, instead   recommending the local vicar, Mr Elton. George Knightly privately expresses his disapproval, telling Emma that she is encouraging Harriet to aspire to a man who can never accept her.
On the way home from a dinner party, Emma finds herself alone in a carriage with Mr Elton. To her shock, he proposes marriage, leading to an awkward rejection. Only then does she learn that what she had mistaken for affection towards Harriet was merely Mr Elton's attempt to woo Emma herself. Mr Elton subsequently leaves the area, returning six weeks later with a new wife, the pretentious Augusta.
Two long-anticipated visitors arrive: Jane Fairfax, the highly accomplished niece ofMiss Bates, a genteel but poor family friend who is notable for her incessant chatter; and the charming Frank Churchill who, always required to be at his wealthy aunt's beck and call, has had few opportunities to visit. Emma finds herself intrigued by Frank and is envious of Jane's talents.
Frank's arrival prompts the Westons to hold aball, at which Mr Elton rudely snubs Harriet. She is rescued by George Knightley, who asks her to dance. Emma and Knightley also share a dance, awakening romantic feelings between them.
During a picnic atBox Hill, Frank urges the company to play a lighthearted game, and Emma, in a moment of thoughtless humour, insults Miss Bates, causing her great distress. Knightley privately reprimands Emma for her unkindness, prompting her to reflect on her behaviour. She apologises to Miss Bates, who forgives her. Harriet confides to Emma that she has again found love; she does not name the man, but Emma assumes she is referring to Frank Churchill.
The sudden death of Frank’s aunt leads to the revelation that Frank and Jane Fairfax have been secretly engaged, a match they had been concealing from her. Emma attempts to break the news gently to Harriet, only to be told that it is George Knightly not Frank whom Harriet loves. According to Harriet, her love is reciprocated.
Knightley happens upon Emma while she is out walking. He is determined now to declare his love for her, but Emma stops him, believing that he has come to confess his love for Harriet. So overcome is Emma when she realises what Knightly is saying that she develops a nosebleed. She joyfully accepts his hand.
Emma visits Mr Martin to make amends, offering him a portrait of Harriet she drew herself. Mr Martin renews his offer of marriage, and this time Harriet accepts. Harriet and Robert Martin marry, followed by Emma and George Knightley.
In October 2018,Anya Taylor-Joywas cast in the lead role, andAutumn de Wildewas signed for her directorial debut.[5]In December 2018,Johnny Flynnjoined the cast.[6]
In March 2019,Bill Nighy,Mia Goth,Josh O'Connor,Callum Turner,Miranda Hart,Rupert Graves,Gemma Whelan,Amber AndersonandTanya Reynoldsjoined the cast,[7]andAlexandra Byrnesigned as costume designer.[8]

Firle Placein Sussex was used for the exterior of Emma's home.[12]Other locations includedLower Slaughter(exteriors) in theCotswoldsstanding in for the village of Highbury,Kingston BagpuizeHouse in Oxfordshire,Wilton HousenearSalisburyinWiltshire, andChavenage HouseatBeverston,Gloucestershire.[12]
Director de Wilde decided the film's title should include afull stop(period) to signify its being aperiod piece.[13]
In the film, Jane Fairfax (played by Amber Anderson) outshines Emma by performing the third movement fromMozart'sPiano Sonata No 12on thefortepiano. A trained pianist, Anderson had to relearn the piece to adapt her technique to the period instrument's shorter keys.[14]
The credit sequence featuresQueen Bee, an original song by Johnny Flynn. Isobel Waller-Bridge asked Flynn to write a song for the film. He wroteQueen Beeto convey Knightley's perspective on Emma, and performed it in a style appropriate for the film's period.[15]
The soundtrack features many a cappella recordings of folk songs by such artists asMaddy Priorandthe Watersons. De Wilde had an immediate conception of the film's music as rooted in folk music. She also wanted the orchestral score to emulateSergei Prokofiev'sPeter and the Wolf,where the characters had a theme personifying each one.[16]
Anya Taylor-Joy, Anderson and Flynn all sing onscreen in the film. Taylor-Joy took pains to explain that her performance ofThe Last Rose of Summerused an affected style that she imagined Emma Woodhouse would use to charm her audience.[17]
Anderson and Flynn sing a duet ofDrink to me Only With Thine Eyeswritten byBen Jonsonin the film during a ball scene.
The adagio from the final movement ofHaydn'sSymphony No. 45 in F sharp minor,Farewell, is also heard in the film.[citation needed]

Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing. This became effective in January 2014, and several titles developed under FilmDistrict would be released under Focus.[17]Under Schlessel, the company began to acquire films with a wider commercial appeal, much like his previous company.[18][19]In May 2015, Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus as a genre label, that was on action, sci-fi, and horror films.[20]
In February 2016, Focus merged withUniversal Pictures International Productionsas part of a new strategy to "align the acquisition and production of specialty films in the global market".[21][22][23]Following this, along with several disappointing box office returns, Schlessel was let go from the company and replaced withPeter Kujawski.[24]

The animated filmCoralinewas also highly profitable for the company. Although suffering its share of unsuccessful releases, Focus has been consistently profitable, and its international sales arm (unusual among studio specialty film divisions) allows it to receive the foreign as well as domestic revenues from its releases.[28]ItsDVDand movie rights revenues are boosted bycult classicsincludingWet Hot American Summer.

At 832 pages,The Luminarieswas the longest work to win the prize in its 45-year history.[14]The chair of the judges,Robert Macfarlanecommented, "It's a dazzling work. It's a luminous work. It is vast without being sprawling." Jonathan Ruppin ofFoylessaid: "I'm confident that she is destined to be one of the most important and influential writers of her generation."[14]Catton was presented with the prize by theDuchess of Cornwallon 15 October 2013 atGuildhall.[14]
In November 2013 Catton was awarded the Canadian Governor General's Literary Award for fiction forThe Luminaries.[16]In January 2014 it was announced that Catton would be awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Literature in May atVictoria University of Wellington,[17]where she has studied.

Catton made zombie movies with her friends as a teenager and participated in the48Hoursfilm challenge, but never studied screenwriting.[20]
WhenLuminarieswas adapted into atelevision miniseriesCatton was screenwriter, an "unusual if not entirely unheard-of" arrangement.[21][22]Catton wrote hundreds of drafts of the pilot episode, but in late 2015BBC Twodeclined the series; she then shifted the focus to make the protagonist Anna Wetherell, a minor character in the book, and rewrote the series, which was commissioned by the BBC in mid-2016.[21]She served asshowrunnerwith director Claire McCarthy during filming.[20]The six-episodeTVNZand BBC series debuted on 17 May 2020.[23]

Catton's third novel,Birnam Wood, was published in February 2023. The title is taken fromMacbeth, and Catton has said the novel draws inspiration from the play.[25]It is a contemporary thriller about a group of young climate activists who call themselves Birnam Wood.[26]
The novel was shortlisted for the 2023Giller Prize.[27][28]The New York Timesnamed it one of the 100 Notable Books of 2023.[29]
In an interview at theJaipur Literary Festivalin January 2015, Catton said that the governments of Australia, Canada and New Zealand were led by "neo-liberal, profit-obsessed, very shallow, very money-hungry politicians who do not care about culture... They care about short-term gains. They would destroy the planet in order to be able to have the life they want. I feel very angry with my Government".[30][31]
Prime MinisterJohn Keysaid he was disappointed at Catton's lack of respect for his Government and claimed she was aligned with theGreen Party. The next day he said her views should not be given any more credence than those of thePeter "The Mad Butcher" LeitchorRichie McCaw.[32]
In January 2015, on air RadioLive hostSean Plunketcalled Catton a traitor and an "ungrateful hua", a Māori slang word which some listeners mistook for "whore".[32][33]TheTaxpayers' Unionalso released a media statement showing Catton had received around $50,000 inCreative New Zealandsupport over her career, and argued that "if Ms Catton isn't thankful for the support by the New Zealand Government while she wroteThe Luminaries, maybe she should use some of the substantial royalties to pay the money back".[34]
In a blog post responding to the affair, Catton commented that her reported remarks were a condensed part of a larger interview, and she was puzzled why her comment at the Jaipur festival had generated such controversy: "I’ve been speaking freely to foreign journalists ever since I was first published overseas, and have criticised the Key government, neo-liberal values, and our culture of anti-intellectualism many times."[35]She continued:
In future interviews with foreign media, I will of course discuss the inflammatory, vicious, and patronising things that have been broadcast and published in New Zealand this week. I will of course discuss the frightening swiftness with which the powerful Right move to discredit and silence those who question them, and the culture of fear and hysteria that prevails. But I will hope for better, and demand it.[35]
The criticism of Catton caused a media storm, including the publication of numerous cartoons, and was termed "Cattongate" by political commentator Bryce Edwards.[36][37]Edwards quoted numerous other commentators who supported Catton's right to express her views, and said the controversy reflected the hollowness of public debate in New Zealand and of the media and politics.[37]
Catton met Chicago-born poetSteven Toussaintat the Iowa Writers' Workshop, and Toussaint moved to New Zealand in 2011 to begin a PhD in US avant-garde poetry at Victoria University of Wellington.[6][38]The couple later lived inMount Edenwhile Catton taught creative writing part-time at theManukau Institute of Technology.[6][19]Catton describes Toussaint as the first reader of her drafts, and he prevailed in an argument over whether one character inThe Luminariesshould be killed off.[38]They married on 3 January 2016.[38][39][40][41]As of 2023[update]the couple live in Cambridge, England with their daughter.[26]
In 2014 Catton used her winnings from theNew Zealand Post Book Awardsto establish the Lancewood/Horoeka Grant. The grant offers a stipend to emerging writers with the aim of providing "the means and opportunity not to write, but to read, and to share what they learn through their reading with their colleagues in the arts".[42]Recipients have included Amy Brown,Craig CliffandRichard Meros.

O'Connor experimented withmethod actingfor his role inGod's Own Country. He described his experience forInterviewmagazine:[4]
I had my own book of senses—paintings and drawings that I'd done and ideas I had. From there, I worked physically with Francis about how this guy would look. By the end of the film I was so skinny; I was gaunt. It was horrific. I was in character the whole way through. It was really lonely and hard. I don't think I'd do it again. You isolate yourself from all your friends.
The CrowncreatorPeter Morganhas compared O'Connor to formerBarcelonamidfielderAndrés Iniesta, a footballer with massive but unobtrusive skill.[2]"I was drawn to his sensitivity and the fact that he was complex but likable," Morgan said on casting O'Connor as Prince Charles.[30]Olivia Colmanpraised him for the tenderness he displayed on-screen, as well as his ability to inhabit the role: "Fragility, sparkle, strength, doubt: It’s all there in a second. Every scene we had together became my favorite scene."[22]

He said of his views onthe monarchy: "I'm arepublican, although not in any kind of fist-waving, campaigning way. I was always mostly uninterested in them."[2][39][40][41]In an interview withThe New York Timeshe said: "I thinkthe Queenis an extraordinary woman. Time after time, lots of men have failed, and this one woman in power has been consistent and remained dutiful and generally apolitical. In that sense, I have huge respect for her — and forCharles[who] is another level of someone who's literally been waiting his entire life for this moment that still hasn't come."[30]
