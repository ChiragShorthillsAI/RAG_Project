Lone Scherfig(Danish:[ˈloːnəˈɕɛɐ̯fi]) (born 2 May 1959)[1]is a Danishfilm directorandscreenwriter. She is especially known for her filmsItalian for Beginners(2000) andAn Education(2009), and is also known for herromantic comedies, such asOne Day(2011).
Lone Scherfig graduated from theNational Film School of Denmarkin 1984.[2]
She initially worked in the advertising business and won awards (including the Lion d'Argent) at the Cannes International Advertising Film Festival.[citation needed]
Scherfig began her career as a director with the television filmMargrethes elskerin 1985. Her directorial debut in film came withKaj's fodselsdag. The film was critically successful and garnered her the Grand Jury prize and the Club Espace Award at theRouen Nordic Film Festival. For a period of time following such success, Scherfig wrote and directed a few short films, and worked with both radio shows and the stage.[citation needed]
She directed the filmNår mor kommer hjem(1998), which received the Grand Prix at theMontreal Film Festivaland the Cinekid Award inAmsterdam.[citation needed]
Scherfig made her international breakthrough with the filmItalian for Beginners(2000), which was critically acclaimed and won several awards, including the Jury Grand PrixSilver Bearaward at theBerlin International Film Festival.[3]Hailed as a feel-good movie, the film is preoccupied with themes of hope, happiness, and choice. It is credited as the most profitable Scandinavian film to date.[4]
Following the creative constraints of theDogme 95movement, Scherfig set the film almost entirely on location within a small space, used sound found only at the source, and shot it on video. The film involves several characters and their various romantic or other interactions that unfold across this limited setting. As opposed to many otherDogme 95films, Scherfig's is rather upbeat and comedic. It has been noted for its rather amusing tone.[5]
FollowingItalian for Beginners, Scherfig made the deadpan comedyWilbur Wants to Kill Himself, released in 2002. This film, not considered a part of theDogme 95canon, is a touching movie centered on a suicidal man who is constantly saved and cared for by his brother. Noted by critics to be a surprisingly lighthearted affair, the movie was praised for Scherfig's ability to craft deep and interesting characters.[6]CriticA.O. Scottmused that the film's tone "ranges from stoic to diffident to quizzical, at least on the surface. But there is an undercurrent of deep and complicated feeling beneath the Scottish reserve; it is signalled by the music, and by Ms. Scherfig's exquisite sense of nuance."[7]Scherfig worked closely with the prolific writerAnders Thomas Jensenin developing a screenplay for this film. She aligned her work with the production companies Sigma Films and Zentropa. Although well received,Wilburwas not as commercially successful asItalian for Beginners. It served as a catalyst for herDogme 95related project called theAdvance Party,in which both Scherfig and Jensen helped write characters forLars Von Trier.[8]
Scherfig followed this by writing and directing another character-focused film:Just Like Home, released in 2007. In this comedic endeavour, set in a little town, several characters unite to discover who could be causing a commotion in the streets at night. The movie explores the various residents of the town and their interactions with each other. Claiming constraints related to theDogme 95, Scherfig said that the film was written piece by piece every day that it was shot.[9]She has said the story is "about trust...the fundamental belief that people you hardly know will want the best for you."[10]While receiving little commercial or critical spotlight, the film served as a bridge between Scherfig's earlier experiments and her more American successes.[citation needed]
In 2009,An Education, Scherfig's most critically lauded film, was released. With a screenplay written by esteemed British fiction authorNick Hornby, the movie was based on journalist Lynn Barber's experiences as a teenager in post-war Britain. The film's story follows 16-year-old Jenny (played byCarey Mulligan) as she is picked up one rainy night by David (played byPeter Sarsgaard), and brought into the bustling and exciting adult London society. Centered on this tender and somewhat morally ambiguous romantic relationship between David and Jenny, the movie was hailed as being subtle and deliberate in its pacing and tone.[11]Many reviewers noted the exceptional performance of Carey Mulligan as the protagonist.[12]She was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance; the film was nominated for Best Picture and Nick Hornby (for Adapted Screenplay).[citation needed]
On making the film, Scherfig has talked about her focus on the theme of being an American teenager examined throughout the story, saying,
"my guess is about America is that it's this combination of innocence and freedom that attracts you. Here in Denmark, as well, it was more liberated than it is now, and was definitely more innocent and less dangerous. I mean, when I was a teenager, the world was a lot safer than it is now for my daughter as a teenager, which meant that I could have a lot more fun. It wasn't risky the way it is now."[13]
She has also discussed the pleasures of working in a more collaborative spirit for this movie, commenting that the movie was "the same piece that we [were] all working on, and that was really important to me as a director that everyone was making the same film, that everyone contributed to the package and tried to strengthen it and get as many facets as possible but not be over-inventive, [to] just tell the story as well as we possibly could."[13]
Scherfig's next film, titledOne Dayand released in 2011, follows the lives of two romantically engaged individuals as they intersect one day each year. Based onnovel of the same name[14][15]byDavid Nichollsand adapted by him as a screenplay, the movie marks a more turning point for Scherfig's career in reaching a  larger audience than any of her previous films. The plot and story of the movie has been characterized as somewhat simple and predictable, but critics noted that Scherfig gave the dialogue and tone of the film a distinct freshness.[16]The reputations of leading actorsAnne HathawayandJim Sturgessboth helped attract a wider audience.
Scherfig had declared her interest in working with Hathaway on this project. She also commented on the difficulties of working with someone else's screenplay, saying in an interview that:
It's so much easier to work with something you've written, because you can cut things or add things on the spot. You can be much more at home and at ease with what you do. You don't feel unfaithful to the writer because there is no writer. Most of the other films I've done I've co-written, and I prefer it. But having said that, when you work with someone else's characters, you get a lot of gifts. You get an entire world, you get to portray people that you couldn't have made up, and entire worlds that are fascinating because they are not yours. It's much harder, I really think it's much harder[17]
Scherfig worked as a consultant writer for the Danish filmAlting. She has worked on other projects (such asRed RoadandDonkeys) in helping write and develop characters. Her most recent work isThe Riot Club, based on the stage playPoshbyLaura Wade, released in 2014. The film follows two first-year students amongst the privileged elite of Oxford University, determined to join the infamous Riot Club, where reputations can be made or destroyed over the course of a single evening. Universal Pictures distributed the film in the UK and Ireland.[18]
Scherfig has come to be recognised as a significant talent in the film industry for her experimentation with creative constraints and astute attention to detail.[6][8]
She has received a BAFTA nomination,[19][20]aFIPRESCI Award, a Jury Prize atBerlin International Film Festival, and numerous other awards and nominations. Movies she has directed have received BAFTA and Oscar nominations, and numerous other awards and nominations.[21][22]
Kaj's fodselsdagwon both the Club Espace Award and the Grand Jury Prize at the Rouen Nordic Film Festival in 1991.Nar mor kommer hjemwon the Cinekid Film Award in 1998.
At theBerlin International Film Festival,Italian for Beginnerswon the FIPRESCI Prize, the Prize of Ecumenical Jury, the Reader Jury of the "Berliner Morgenpost," and the Silver Berlin Bear, and was nominated for the Golden Berlin Bear. It was also nominated for a Bodil (as wasWilbur Wants to Kill HimselfandAn Education).Italian for Beginnerswas nominated at the Chicago International Film Festival, the European Film Awards, the Goya Awards, and picked up awards at Bordeaux International Festival of Women in Cinema, the Festróia-Tróia International Film Festival, the Flaiano Film Festival, the Hamptons International Film Festival, the Paris Film Festival, the Robert Festival, the Valladolid Film Festival, and the Warsaw International Film Festival.[citation needed]
Wilbur Wants to Kill Himselfgarnered nominations from the British Independent Film Awards, the Chlotudis Awards, the Robert Festival, the Valladolid Film Festival, and came in second place at the Emden International Film Festival. It took home awards at the Festróia-Tróia International Film Festival, the Hamptons International Film Festival, the Skip City International D-Cinema Festival, the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, and the Victoria Independent Film & Video Festival in Canada.[citation needed]
AlthoughJust Like Homewas shunned by critics, Scherfig's fourth film was offered the most recognition.An Educationwas nominated at the BAFTA Awards, the British Independent Film Awards, the European Film Awards, the Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards, the Satellite Awards, and the Academy Awards. It won various awards at the Chicago International Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Awards, the Mill Valley Film Festival, the Robert Festival, and the Sundance Film Festival.[citation needed]

The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron.

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
