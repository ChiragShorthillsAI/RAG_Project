The Wanting Mareis a 2020science fictionfantasyfilm written and directed by Nicholas Ashe Bateman.
In apost-apocalypticrealm called Anmaere, an annual drive ships wild horses from a rundown city called Whithren to another, far-off city, Levithen. Many denizens of Whithren hope to board the boat with the horses and travel to Levithen, which they believe holds a more promising future for them.
The Wanting Mareis Bateman's first feature-length film; he did not attend film school, had no visual effects training, and worked independently on the film's development, part of which was funded through a campaign on the crowdsourcing websiteIndiegogo.[3][4]Bateman credits the earliest inspirations of the film to be Emily Bronte'sWuthering Heights.[5][6]
The film took over five years to make, and has over 500 visual effects shots.[7][8]Cinematographer David A. Ross used a Sony A7SII with Anamorphic lenses.[9]Bateman shot much of the film in astorage unitinPaterson, New Jersey;[10][11]while other shots were filmed along the coast of the northeastern United States and inNova Scotia, Canada.[12]
The film was largely shot on green-screen[13]and composited in After Effects and Blender.[12]The film utilizes many digital matte paintings done by the director.[14]
During the five years of production, Bateman lived in the office space that was used to edit the film and create the visual effects.[13]During this time, the group of Bateman, David A. Ross, Z. Scott Schaefer, and Cassandra Louise Baker founded the visual effects companyMaere Studios.[15][14]
Shane Carruthwas involved as an executive producer for a time, but he removed his name from the project in 2020 after accusations of abuse against him were made public.[16][3][17]
In hisreview, Eric Kohn ofIndiewirecalled the film 'The Most Intriguing World-Building since 'The Matrix'.[18]
Nerdistcalled it a'dreamy, dazzling debut[19]' andVariety'sMark Keizer said in hisreview:"the film’s one unmistakable thrill is knowing its expansive world is the brainchild of one person, a first-time director who dropped out of college, never went to film school and worked for more than five years to fulfill a vision."
The film received a positive review fromWired,[20]The Los Angeles Times,[21]RogerEbert.com[22]and mixed reviews fromIndieWire,[23]RogerEbert.com,[24]andPolygon.[25]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
