The taxi driver calls an ambulance and Leo is taken to the emergency room. Molly's mother, Rita, arrives and chastises her ex-husband for his behavior. Molly argues with Rita and Leo's attending doctor while Leo fixates on his dead dog, Néstor.

She tells her father that she cannot go on pretending anymore. Later that night, Leo walks out of his apartment and roams the streets barefoot as Molly frantically searches for him. He is eventually rescued by two taxi drivers.
Leo's wife, Dolores, pleads with him to get out of bed and get ready. In the kitchen, he finds her preparing a bag filled with arranged flowers before driving off in their truck.

That night, Anni and her friends board a partycruisethat Leo secretly follows with hisrowboatinto the open sea. The cruise leaves him behind and Leo tires himself out attempting to catch up. The next morning, a group of fishermen find Leo dead in his rowboat and search his body for identification.
Leo is delivered to Molly by the police, who takes him back to his apartment. He begins to recount the stories he believes are running parallel to his own life, including his marriage in Mexico as a young man and his unexpected death in Greece. Molly tells him he was once married to a woman named Dolores before he emigrated to the United States and that he had run off to Greece when Molly was born, but returned after realizing his mistake. Molly sits by his bed and promises to stay by his side; meanwhile, a parallel version of Molly packs her things and walks out of Leo's apartment.

Focus Features LLCis an American independentfilm productionanddistribution company, owned byComcastas a unit of sister film production and distribution companyUniversal Pictures, which is itself a unit of Comcast's entertainment divisionNBCUniversal. Focus Features distributesindependentandforeign filmsin the United States and internationally.
In November 2018,The Hollywood Reporternamed Focus Features "Distributor of the Year" for its success behind the year's breakout documentary filmWon't You Be My Neighbor?andSpike Lee'sBlacKkKlansman.[2]The studio's most successful film to date isDownton Abbey, which garnered $194.3 million at the worldwide box office.[3]
Focus Features' filmshave earned numerous awards nominations, including a total of 175Academy Award nominationsand 35 wins across various categories.[4]However, they are alsothe distributor with the most Best Picture losses, out of 17 nominationsas of 2025.[a][5][6]
Focus Features was formed in 2002 by James Schamus[7]and David Linde[7]and formed from the divisional merger of USA Films, Universal Focus andGood Machine, as well as several assets of theVivendi-affiliated film studioStudioCanal.[8]USA Films was created byBarry Dillerin 1999 when he purchasedInterscope Communications, certain assets of the film division ofPropaganda Films,October FilmsandGramercy PicturesfromSeagramand merged the three labels together;[9][10][11][12]USA Films was led byScott Greenstein.[13]Universal Focus was the specialty film arm ofUniversal Picturesthat was created in 1999 as Universal Classics, which was led by Paul Hardart and Claudia Gray, to replace theOctober Filmslabel in order to get a group of titles to be distributed by USA Films, focused on the marketing of niche-based acquisitions byUniversal Pictures International,Working Title, WT2 Productions,Revolution FilmsandDNA Films, and eventually rebranded into Universal Focus by 2000.[14][15]
In March 2004, Focus Features revivedRogue Picturesas a genre label, which was once used byOctober Filmsin the late 1990s. Rogue Pictures would be led by the same team who led the standard Focus management.[16]
On October 2, 2013, James Schamus was fired from his position as CEO of Focus, with the New York offices being shut down in the process. He was succeeded by Peter Schlessel, whose companyFilmDistrictwould be merged into Focus and folded into the trade name High Top Releasing.

Charlotte Sally PotterOBE(born 19 September 1949) is an English film director and screenwriter.[1][2][3]She directedOrlando(1992),[4]which won the audience prize for Best Film at theVenice Film Festival.[5][6]
Potter was born and raised in London. Her mother was a music teacher and her father was an interior designer and a poet.[7]Her younger brotherNicbecame the bassist for the rock groupVan der Graaf Generator.[8]When asked about her background, which influenced her work as a filmmaker, she responded, "I came from anatheistbackground and an anarchist background, which meant that I grew up in an environment that was full of questions, where nothing could be taken for granted."[9]
When asked about what she learned about filmmaking from pursuing it as a seventeen-year-old woman in the UK during the 60s, Potter laughed.
You know, most kinds of securities are illusions, and we need to kind of duck and weave as filmmakers, go with the flow, go where the harvest is. [...] I knew very early on, if I waited for somebody to give me money to do something, I'd never do anything.[10]
Potter began making amateur films at age 14, using an 8mm camera given to her by an uncle.[11]She eventually dropped out of school at age 16 to pursue filmmaking. From 1968 to 1970 she worked as a kitchen worker and a picture researcher for BBC in order to support herself and her work. She had joined theLondon Film-Makers' Co-opand began making experimental short films, includingJerk(1969) andPlay(1970). She later trained as a dancer and choreographer at the London School of Contemporary Dance. She made both film and dance pieces, includingCombines(1972), before founding Limited Dance Company withJacky Lansley.
Potter became an award-winning performance artist and theatre director, with shows includingMounting,Death and the MaidenandBerlin. In addition, she was a member of several music bands (includingFeminist Improvising Groupand The Film Music Orchestra) working as a lyricist and singer. She collaborated (as a singer-songwriter) with composerLindsay Cooperon the song cycleOh Moscow,which was performed throughout Europe, Russia and North America in the late 1980s and commercially released.
Potter continued as a composer when she collaborated with David Motion on the soundtrack toOrlando.She wrote the score for the film,The Tango Lesson,for which she sang "I am You" in the final scene. Her most recent music work is as producer and co-composer withFred Frithof the original tracks forYesandRage.
Referring to her career as a choreographer, Potter said, "Choreography was the perfect 'poor theatre.' All you needed were willing bodies and some space. So it was as a choreographer that I learnt how to direct and it was as a dancer that I learnt how to work."[12]
Potter returned to filmmaking with her short filmThriller(1979), which was a hit on the international festival circuit. This was followed by her first feature film,The Gold Diggers(1983), starringJulie Christie. She directed another short film,The London Story(1986); a documentary series for Channel 4,Tears,Laughter,Fear and Rage(1986); andI am an Ox,I am a Horse,I am a Man,I am a Woman(1988), a film about women in Soviet cinema.
As director of the internationally distributedOrlando(1992), Potter received greater appreciation for her writing and direction. StarringTilda Swinton, the film was based onVirginia Woolf'snovel by the same nameand adapted for the screen by Potter. In addition to two Academy Award nominations,Orlandowon more than 25 international awards, including the Felix, awarded by the European Film Academy for the best Young European Film of 1993; and first prizes atSt Petersburg,Thessalonikiand other European festivals.
The novel had previously been considered impossible to adapt for the screen, because it took place over 400 years and followed a character whose sex changes from a man to a woman. Funding the feature proved difficult, andOrlandotook seven years to complete.[9]Filming and editing took 20 weeks. Preparation for the film, including adapting the novel, funding the film, scouting locations, etc., took four years.[13]
When asked whether she thought she would continue to work on feminist themes, Potter replied:
I have come to the conclusion that I can't use that term in my work. Not because of a disavowal of the underlying principles that gave birth to that word – the commitment to liberation, dignity, equality. But it has become a trigger word that stops people's thinking. You literally see people's eyes glaze over with exhaustion when the word flashes into the conversation.[13]
She next directed the film,The Tango Lesson(1996), in which she also performed with renowned dancerPablo Veron. First presented at theVenice Film Festival, the film was awarded theOmbú de Orofor Best Film at the Mar del Plata Film Festival, Argentina; the SADAIC Great Award from the Sociedad Argentina de Autores y Compositores de Música; as well as receiving Best Film nominations from BAFTA and the US National Board of Review.The Tango Lessonis semi-autobiographical, based on Potter's experiences learning Argentinian Tango with Veron while writing the screenplay forRage.
The Tango Lessonmarks Potter's first time performing on screen. Regarding this decision she stated, "I knew that I had to perform in this one because the impetus for the film came out of my own desire to dance."[12]Potter's professional collaborations with Pablo Veron continue inThe Man Who Criedand the stage production ofCarmen(2007).
SinceThe Tango Lesson's release, Potter continued to receive letters from viewers who felt touched by it. In a 2005 interview with FF2 Media'sJan Lisa Huttner, Potter suggests, "I think maybe I'm not the best person to analyze it, but what people pick up on is the passion behind the film: the passion to make the film itself, the passion to dance again. At the age of 46 I put myself in a movie, dancing the Tango with the best tango dancer in the world. [...] It was so terrifying, and so driven by passion at the same time, maybe that's partly what people respond to."[14]
The Man Who Cried(starringJohnny Depp,Christina Ricci,Cate BlanchettandJohn Turturro), premiered at theVenice Film Festivalin 2000. Ricci plays a Jewish girl who, separated from her father when she was young in Soviet Russia, travels to America to find him.[15]
It was followed byYes(2004), withJoan Allen, Simon Abkarian andSam Neill.Yeswas written in response to the attacks in the United States of 11 September 2001; it is considered Potter's return to more experimental methods of filmmaking. The screenplay is written in verse and the film's budget was much smaller than that forThe Man Who Cried. Regarding the film's budget and stylistic approaches, Potter said:
Originally I was trying to figure out how we could shoot this film without any lights, because there didn't seem to be enough money in the budget to have any. One solution was to shoot at six frames a second, or even three. Later you print each frame four (or eight) times to bring it into sync at twenty-four frames per second. You can shoot almost in the dark, and still see people's faces ... we did some tests and found that it was very beautiful; so I decided to make it part of the language of the film.[16][citation needed]
In 2007 Potter directedGeorges Bizet'sCarmenforEnglish National Operaat the London Coliseum, starringAlice Cooteand designed byEs Devlin.
Rage(2009) was the first feature ever to premiere on cell-phones. The cast includesJudi Dench,Steve Buscemi,Lily ColeandJude Law.Ragewas in competition at theBerlin Film Festivalin 2009 and nominated for aWEBBYfor Best Drama in 2010.
Potter's seventh feature film entitledGinger & Rosawas written and directed by Potter and produced by Christoper Sheppard and Andrew Lityin.[17]The film starredElle FanningandAlice Englertas the title characters and received its premiere at theTelluride Film Festival.[18]The film went into limited release in the UK in 2012 before enjoying a limited run in North America in early 2013.[18]
In 2017, Potter's black comedyThe Partywas released. It was selected to compete for theGolden Bearin the main competition section of the67th Berlin International Film Festivaland was awarded the Guild Film Prize.[19][20]The film features a star-studded ensemble cast withPatricia Clarkson,Bruno Ganz,Emily Mortimer,Cherry Jones,Cillian Murphy,Kristin Scott ThomasandTimothy Spall.
In 2020, Potter's dramaThe Roads Not Takenwas released after a world premiere at theBerlin International Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Golden Bear. It follows Molly (Elle Fanning) caring for her father, Leo (Javier Bardem), who suffers from early-onset dementia. In an interview at Berlinale, Potter described the research process involved in providing an accurate and sensitive portrayal of Leo's illness:
Although my brother had a variant of it and I had already done a lot of research into it, I consulted a neurologist to make sure that everything was clinically correct. Javier Bardem also did his own research and visited a clinic for people with that particular variant of dementia. And he discovered what I knew, that it can take so many different forms and pathways. Most people think dementia is Alzheimer's, but Alzheimer's is just one variation of dementia.[21]

Bardem married actressPenélope Cruzin 2010 and together they have two children. In January 2018, Bardem became the ambassador ofGreenpeacefor the protection ofAntarctica.[1]
Bardem was born on 1 March 1969 inLas Palmas de Gran Canaria, in theCanary Islands, Spain. His mother,Pilar Bardem(1939–2021), was an actress, and his father, José Carlos Encinas Doussinague (1931–1995), was the son of a cattle rancher from theprovince of Salamanca.[2]According to Pilar's memoirs, José had a "capricious and violent will," and shot up the front door. He changed jobs more than 10 times, leading to evictions and the children going hungry. The two separated shortly after Javier's birth.[3][4]His mother raised him and his elder siblings,CarlosandMónica, alone (another sibling died shortly after birth), both of whom have also pursued an acting career. His father died of leukemia in 1995.[2][5]
On his mother’s side, Bardem comes from a long line of filmmakers and actors dating back to the earliest days of Spanish cinema. He is a grandson of actorsRafael BardemandMatilde Muñoz Sampedro(sister of actressesMercedesandGuadalupe),[6]and a nephew of screenwriter and directorJuan Antonio Bardem.[7]On the latter's side, he is a cousin of filmmakerMiguel Bardem.[8]His uncle Juan Antonio was imprisoned by theFranco regimefor hisanti-fascistfilms.[5]Bardem was brought up in the Roman Catholic faith by his grandmother.[9][10]
As a child, he spent time at theatres and on film sets.[5]In 1974, he made his first television appearance, inFernando Fernán Gómez's television seriesEl pícaro[es](The Scoundrel).[11][5][12]He also playedrugbyfor the junior Spanish National Team.[13][14]Though he grew up in a family full of actors, Bardem did not see himself going into the family business, and painting was his preferred medium.[15]He went on to study painting for four years at Madrid'sEscuela de Artes y oficios.[13][16]In need of money, he took acting jobs to support his painting but felt he was a bad painter and eventually abandoned it as a career.[15]
In 1989, for the Spanish comedy showEl Día Por Delante(The Day Ahead), he had to wear aSupermancostume for a comedic sketch, a job that made him question whether he wanted to be an actor at all.[17]Bardem also worked as a stripper (for one day) during his struggling acting career.[18]
Bardem came to notice in a small role in his first major motion picture,The Ages of Lulu, when he was 21, in which he appeared along with his mother,Pilar Bardem. He also appeared in minor roles inAmo tu cama ricaandHigh Heels.[19]Bigas Luna, the director ofLulu, was sufficiently impressed to give him the leading male role in his next film,Jamón Jamónin 1992, in which Bardem played a would-beunderwear modelandbullfighter. The film, which also starred his eventual wifePenélope Cruz, was a major international success.[13]Bardem featured inSancho Gracia'sHuidos,[19]and starred in Bigas Luna's next filmGolden Balls(1993).
Bardem's talent did not go unnoticed in theEnglish-speaking world. In 1997,John Malkovichwas the first to approach him, then a 27-year-old, for a role in English, but the Spanish actor turned down the offer because his English was still poor.[14][20]His first English-speaking role came that same year, in with directorÁlex de la Iglesia'sPerdita Durango, playing asantería-practicing bank robber.
After starring in about two dozen films in his native country, he gained international recognition inJulian Schnabel'sBefore Night Fallsin 2000, portrayingCubanpoetReinaldo Arenas.[13]He received praise from his idolAl Pacino; the message Pacino left on Bardem's answering machine was something he considers one of the most beautiful gifts he has ever received.[5]For that role, he received a nomination for theAcademy Award for Best Actor, the first for a Spaniard. Immediately after, he turned down the role of Danny Witwer inMinority Reportwhich eventually went toColin Farrell.[21]Instead, in 2002, Bardem starred in Malkovich's directorial debut,The Dancer Upstairs. Malkovich originally had Bardem in mind for the role of the detective's assistant, but the movie's time trying to find financing gave Bardem time to learn English and take on the lead role of the detective. "I will always be grateful to him because he really gave me my very first chance to work in English", Bardem has said of Malkovich.[14][20]
Bardem won Best Actor at theVenice Film Festivalfor his role inMar Adentro(2004), released in the United States asThe Sea Inside, in which he portrayed thequadriplegicturnedassisted suicideactivistRamón Sampedro. He made his Hollywood debut in a brief appearance as a crime lord who summonsTom Cruise's hitman to do the dirty work of dispatching witnesses in the crime dramaCollateral. He stars inMiloš Forman's 2006 filmGoya's GhostsoppositeNatalie Portman, where he plays a twisted monk during theSpanish Inquisition.[22]
In 2007, Bardem acted in two film adaptations: theCoen brothers'No Country for Old Men, and the adaptation of theColombiannovelLove in the Time of CholerawithGiovanna MezzogiornobyGabriel García Márquez. InNo Country for Old Men, he played asociopathicassassin,Anton Chigurh. For that role, he became the first Spaniard to win anAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[23]He won aGolden Globe AwardandScreen Actors Guild (SAG) Awardfor Best Supporting Actor, theCritics' Choice Awardfor Best Supporting Actor, and the 2008British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Awardfor Best Supporting Actor.
Bardem's rendition of Chigurh's trademark word, "What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?"

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
