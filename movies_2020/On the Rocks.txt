It had its world premiere at theNew York Film Festivalon September 22, 2020. It received alimited theatrical releaseon October 2, 2020, byA24, followed by digital streaming on October 23, 2020, byApple TV+. It received positive reviews from critics, who noted it as lighter than Coppola's previous films, and praised Murray's performance.
Laura and Dean are a married couple living in Manhattan with two young daughters, Maya and Theo. Laura is a novelist who is stuck in a rut as she struggles to finish her latest book. Dean is a successful entrepreneur at a burgeoning tech start-up, surrounded by young and attractive co-workers, often leaving Laura in charge of their daughters. One night, after arriving home from one of his frequent business trips, Dean climbs into bed and begins to kiss Laura passionately. However, once he recognizes her voice, he abruptly stops and goes to sleep, much to Laura's confusion. The next day, Laura finds a woman's toiletry bag in Dean's luggage; he later explains that it belongs to his business associate, Fiona, and he offered to carry it in his suitcase because she could not fit it in hercarry-on.
Laura confides her misgivings about Dean to her father, Felix, a wealthy, semiretired art dealer. A longtime playboy, Felix flirts with most women he encounters and believes that men are biologically wired to cheat. Convinced that Dean is having an affair, Felix proposes an investigation into him and encourages Laura to check his phone for incriminating text messages. Laura reluctantly does so, but finds nothing out of the ordinary.
While away on a business trip, DeanFaceTimesLaura on her birthday and surprises her with a gift, aThermomix, about which she does not seem particularly excited. Despite previously insisting that she did not want to celebrate her birthday, Laura agrees to go out to a restaurant with Felix. He reveals that he had Dean followed and he was spotted shopping for jewelry atCartier. As Laura grows suspicious, Felix picks her up in his vintage sports car and convinces her to stake out Dean as he attends a work dinner. After Dean leaves in a cab with Fiona, Felix speeds through the streets after them, but Laura and he end up pulled over by two police officers due to reckless driving. Felix knows the father of one of the officers, using this to charm his way out of a ticket.
Felix later discovers that Dean is planning a trip to a Mexican resort, which Laura does not believe. The next day, Dean casually tells her about the trip. Upon learning that Fiona is going on the trip as well, an increasingly suspicious Laura calls Felix, who convinces her to follow Dean to Mexico to spy on him. At the resort, Laura and Felix argue over his infidelity, which he attempts to rationalize by saying he felt undervalued by her mother after their children were born, and tearfully reveals that his former mistress recently died. Laura asserts that his expectations regarding women's affections are unattainable. They eventually spot a woman in Dean's room one evening. When Laura rushes in to confront Dean, she is surprised to find Fiona in the room with her female friend. Dean then calls Laura to inform her that he left early and is on his way back home. Realizing her mistake, Laura lashes out at Felix, berating him for his selfishness and poor treatment of her mother.
Back in New York, Laura and Dean have a heart-to-heart conversation, in which they share their respective fears and insecurities; she had been feeling alienated from him due to his constant business trips, while he says he had been busy working because he wanted to be a better provider for his family. They reconcile, and Laura overcomes her writer's block. Some time later, Felix visits Laura and the two make amends. While at a restaurant, Dean surprises Laura with a second birthday gift—an engraved Cartier watch. Laura takes off the vintage watch Felix had previously given her and puts on Dean's.
On November 15, 2018, it was announced thatApplehad entered into a multi-year agreement with entertainment companyA24to produce a slate of original films in partnership with their worldwide video unit.[3]On January 15, 2019, it was announced that the first film produced under that partnership would be directed bySofia Coppolaand titledOn the Rocks.[4]
Alongside the film's initial announcement, it was confirmed that it would starBill MurrayandRashida Jones.[4]In April 2019,Marlon Wayansjoined the cast of the film.[5]In June 2019,Jessica Henwickjoined the cast of the film.[6]By July,Jenny Slatehad been announced as joining the cast.[7]
Principal photography for the film began in June 2019 in New York City.[8]
On the Rockshad its world premiere at theNew York Film Festivalon September 22, 2020.[9][10]It received alimited theatrical releasebyA24on October 2, 2020, followed by digital streaming on October 23, 2020, byApple TV+.[11][12]
On review aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 87% based on 290 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "On the Rocksisn't as potent as its top-shelf ingredients might suggest, but the end result still goes down easy – and offers high proof of Bill Murray's finely aged charm."[13]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted average scoreof 73 out of 100 based on 47 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[14]
David Ehrlich ofIndieWiregave the film a "B+" and said that "On the Rocksisn't destined to achieve the same kind of iconic status as some of Coppola's previous work. It isn't disposable, but it also doesn't offer anything to obsess about, which is a real change of pace for a filmmaker who launched a zillionTumblrsandPinterestboards and gave humanity thegifofEmma Watsonsaying 'I wanna rob.'"[15]Owen GleibermanofVarietysaid that "On the Rocksturns into a boozy humanistic hang-out caper movie, one that's light-spirited and compelling, mordantly alive to the ins and outs of marriage, and a winning showcase for Murray's aging-like-fine-whisky brand of world-weary deviltry."[16]A. A. Dowd ofThe A.V. Clubgave the film a B, praising Murray's performance as "an irresistible star turn, loose and funny and comfortable" but calling it weak among Coppola's work.[17]
Other reviews were less glowing. Socialist magazineJacobin'sEileen Jones described the film as, "another meandering depiction of life as a bored and alienated celebrity," and noted it for being, "Extraordinarily vapid ... oblivious to its own world of wealth, privilege, and access."[18]

Apple TV+is an Americansubscriptionover-the-topstreaming serviceowned byApple. The service launched on November 1, 2019, and it offers a selection of original production film and television series calledApple Originals.[9]The service was announced during theApple Special Event of March 2019,[10][11]where entertainers from Apple TV+ projects appeared onstage, includingJennifer Aniston,Oprah Winfrey, andSteven Spielberg.[12][13]The service can be accessed through Apple's website and through theApple TV app, which has gradually become available on manyApple devicesand some major competingdigital media players,[14]including somesmart TVmodels and video-game consoles.
Apple plans to expand the services' availability,[15][16][17][18]and there are workarounds for subscribers whose device is not presently supported.[14]Access is included as part of theApple Onesubscription.[19]Most of the content is available inDolby Visionprofile 5 andDolby Atmos. Upon its debut, Apple TV+ was available in about 100 countries, fewer than the reported target of 150.[20][21]Several countries were excluded from service despite other Apple products being available.[22][23][24]Commentators noted that the fairly wide initial reach of the service offered Apple an advantage over other recently launched services such asDisney+, and that because Apple distributes its own content through the service instead of distributing licensed third-party content (as, for example,Huludoes) it will not be limited by licensing issues during its expansion.[25][26][27]
By early 2020, Apple TV+ had poor growth and low subscriber numbers relative to competing services.[28][29][30][31]In the middle of that year, Apple began to license older television programs and films, attempting to stay competitive with other services, attract and retain a viewership for its original content, and convert into subscribers users who were trialing the service.[29][28]Since then, the service has become the home to critically acclaimed content: between September 2021 and March 2022, Apple TV+ netted aPrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy SerieswithTed Lassoand theAcademy Award for Best PicturewithCODA, the first Best Picture win for a film distributed by a streaming service.[32]Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston have all signed a multi year look deal with Apple TV+ to develop more television projects under their production companies after their critically acclaimed shows. Apple TV+ (along with the simultaneously announceda-la-cartepremium-videosubscription aggregation serviceApple TV app) is part of a concerted effort by Apple to expand its service revenues.[16][33][34]The service's programming arm isApple Studios.
Apple had long been rumored to have an interest in beginning astreaming televisionservice, and in 2015 entered into negotiations with varioustelevision studiosand programmers to aggregate their content for a live-television streaming bundle.[35][36]Negotiations fell apart over differing views on how to value the content, lack of transparency on details, and the personality of Apple's chief negotiator,Eddy Cue.[35]
In October 2016, Apple CEOTim Cooksaid that television is "of intense interest to me and other people here", and added that Apple has "started focusing on some original content", which he called "a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it's an area we're focused on."[37]
In June 2017, Apple began to take the first major steps to form its new television unit by hiring the co-presidents ofSony Pictures Television, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to oversee all aspects of worldwide video programming.[36][2]In August, Matt Cherniss was hired as Head of Domestic Creative Development, reporting directly to Van Amburg and Erlicht.[3]For the rest of 2017, Apple continued to fill out its executive team for Apple TV+, with Kim Rozenfeld joining as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted,Jay Huntjoining as Creative Director for Europe,Morgan Wandelljoining as Head of International Creative Development, Tara Sorensen joining as Head of Kids Programming, and Max Aronson, Ali Woodruff, Carina Walker, and Michelle Lee joining as development and creative executives.[38][39][4][6][40]
Throughout 2019, Apple continued to build out its unscripted content team, with Molly Thompson hired as Head of Documentaries in April.[5]In November, Rozenfeld stepped down as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted to focus on producing content again with a first-look content production deal with Apple under his Half Full Productions. Cherniss took over Rozenfeld's duties overseeing current scripted programming.[41]
In May 2018, it was reported that Apple was expected to start a sister project to its original content service, and begin selling subscriptions to certain video services directly via itsApple TV appapplication oniOSandtvOS, rather than asking Apple device owners to subscribe to those services through applications individually downloaded from Apple's app store.[42]
In October 2018, it was reported that Apple would distribute its future original content through a still-in-development digital video service within its TV application that is pre-installed in all iOS and tvOS devices. The service was expected to feature both original content, free to owners of Apple devices, as well as subscription "channels" from legacy media companies such asHBOandStarz, which would allow customers to sign up for online-only services.[43]Later that month, it was reported that Apple intended to roll out the service in the U.S. during the first half of 2019 and that it would expand its availability to around 100 countries in the months after its launch.[44]
On March 25, 2019, Apple held a press event to announce Apple TV+. At the event, Apple showed a teaser of its upcoming original content and formally announced some of it, with actors and producers attached to the content appearing on stage. The announced content includedHelpsters, the first series fromSesame Workshop, the producer ofSesame Street, and Oprah Winfrey's first projects for Apple TV+, including a documentary under the working titleToxic Labor[45]about workplace sexual harassment, a documentary series about mental health, and a revival ofOprah's Book Clubas a standalone television series.[46][47]
On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would launch on November 1 at $4.99 per month (with a 1-week free trial) for an account that can be shared with up to six family members. Apple also announced that it would be give away a year of Apple TV+ to anyone who bought a newApple TV,Mac,iPad,iPhone, oriPod Touchbeginning that day.[48]Student subscribers to the monthlyApple Musicservice at a discounted rate also have Apple TV+ bundled in at no additional cost for the time being.[49]
From the start of Apple TV+ on November 1, 2019, Apple offered a free one-year subscription to anyone buying certain of its hardware products (an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod Touch, or Mac).[50]Apple initially extended the free year that was due to end on November 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021,[51]but then announced in mid-January 2021 that it would extend it a second time to July 31, 2021.[52]
In mid-June 2021, Apple added a note to its website advising customers that new users subscribing after June 30, 2021, would receive only three months of free subscription instead of a year.[53]
On October 24, 2022, Apple announced it was to increase pricing of Apple TV+ (along withApple MusicandApple One) subscriptions in many regions. The monthly plan increased $2 to $6.99, and the annual plan increased $20 to $69.[54]
During the announcement of Apple TV+, Apple announced a number of prominent writers, directors, and stars who would be featured in the service. The signing of high-profile talent was intended to attract viewers to the service.[55]
As of March 2019[update], five of the upcoming series had completed production, with six more well into filming.[56]On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would have eight original series (seven scripted and one unscripted) and one original documentary available at launch, with plans to launch new original content every month thereafter. Most series were expected to launch with three episodes, with a new episode released weekly thereafter, although Apple said that not all series would follow that model and that some series might instead launch all at once.[57]
Early critical reaction to the bulk of the service's programming was mixed to poor, but commentators predicted that Apple would have time to grow into its new role as a content provider and to produce well-regarded content, especially as the free year of the service provided with many Apple product purchases enticed users to continue watching, and for some to eventually pay for a subscription, as new series are released.[58][59][15]
On March 13, 2020, Apple suspended all active filming on Apple TV+ shows due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, and all production on series was postponed for an indeterminate period.[60]
Apple's decision in mid-2020 to license large swaths of existing older content for the Apple TV+ service was viewed, in part, as buying time for its original content production during the pandemic by keeping users engaged and in a habit of visiting the service regularly, so that a viewer base would be in place by the time new Apple original content was released.[29][28]
In addition, Apple TV+ endeavored to gain new high-profile content, taking advantage of the pandemic's disruption of theatrical film releases. Among these acquisitions were the 2020 feature filmGreyhoundstarringTom Hanks, which was purchased fromSony Picturesfor $70 million.[61]In July 2020, the service won a heated bidding war forEmancipation, a slavery-based action-thriller starringWill Smithand directed byAntoine Fuqua.[62]Apple paid a record $105 million for the rights.[62]Apple also reportedly considered a $350 to $400 million offer for the rights to stream theJames BondfilmNo Time to Die, which was far short of the $650 to $800 million studioMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(owned byAmazon, which is one of theBig Techcompanies alongside Apple) was willing to accept.[63]
In October 2017, following reports ofsexual abuse allegationsagainst producerHarvey Weinstein, Apple announced that it was severing ties withThe Weinstein Company(TWC) and cancelling a plannedbiopicseries aboutElvis Presley.[64]
In April 2018, Apple signedKerry Ehrinto a multi-year deal to produce original content.[65]Ehrin and Apple renewed the deal in May 2020.[66]
In June 2018, Apple signed theWriters Guild of America's minimum basic agreement andOprah Winfreyto a multi-year content partnership.[67][68]The same month, Apple announced that it had given a multi-series order toSesame Workshopto produce variouslive-actionand animated series as well as a single puppet-based series.[69]
In September 2018, it was reported that Apple had decided to shelveVital Signs, a six-episode biopic television series centering on the life of hip-hop producer and performerDr. Dreand starringIan McShane,Sam Rockwell, andMichael K. Williams, due to concerns about the show's content being too graphic, with moments cited including characters usingcocaine, instances ofgun violence, and an explicitorgyscene. Reports further indicated that Apple CEO Tim Cook was taking a hands-on approach to the company's Worldwide Video Unit, with programming decisions reportedly being aligned to Cook's personal taste, with a preference for family-friendly shows. Various programs in different stages of production apparently had their content altered, including the toning down ofThe Morning Showand the removal of crucifixes from a scene in theM. Night Shyamalandrama series. Additionally, Apple reportedly passed on a television series from comedianWhitney Cummingsabout the #MeToo movement because it was "too sensitive a topic".[70][71][72]Cummings's series was ultimately put into development byAmazon Prime Videoin October 2018.[73]
In November 2018, Apple entered into a multi-year agreement with entertainment companyA24to produce a slate of original films in partnership with its Worldwide Video Unit.[74]The same month, Apple signed a deal with DHX Media (nowWildBrain) and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide to develop and produce original programs, including new series, specials, and shorts based on thePeanutscharacters.

Apple TV+ released its first movie in theaters,Killers of the Flower Moon.

Apple is seemingly pleased with its box-office returns, which reached $221 million and nearly made back its budget. It is apparent that Apple is attempting to compete with movie production companies.[119][120][121]
In March 2022, Apple announced that it would airFriday Night Baseball, a weekly doubleheader ofMajor League Baseball(MLB) games with live pre- and postgame shows on Apple TV+ in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom starting in the2022 Major League Baseball season.[122]

Apple TV+ subscribers can watch select games at no additional charge, and receive a discount on the MLS Season Pass.[126][127]
In mid-2020, Apple began discussions with film and television studios to license their previously released content as part of an effort to build a back catalog of non-original films and television shows for the streaming service.[30][29]The shift was designed to help the service better compete against the large content libraries competitors likeNetflixhave.[30]This represented a pivot for Apple, which had initially attempted to build the service entirely on original content, avoiding licensing fees to help keep monthly subscription fees low, and relying on its Apple TV Channels content partners to supply other content users wanted.[30][29]
Analysts believed that the addition of older, highly re-watchable content like popular sitcoms and well-liked films would help retain the slowly growing subscriber base while Apple continues to develop original content.[28]The shift was also an acknowledgement of poor growth, especially relative to competing services.[28]The back catalog development was also seen as a move to attempt to persuade free trial users to transition into paid users as the first wave of one-year trials was scheduled to expire in November 2020.[29]
On May 26, 2020, Apple announced its first acquisition of catalogue content would be theFraggle Rockseries.[128]In addition to being the exclusive home of the 1983–1987Jim Henson Companyseries, Apple would develop a new, full-length, rebootedFraggle Rockseries after the success of theFraggle Rock: Rock On!short-form series on Apple TV+.[129]On October 19, 2020, Apple announced the exclusive transmission rights of the various animated productions of thePeanutsfranchise, withdrawing them from broadcast television after 55 years; as part of that agreement, Apple TV+ must make the majorPeanutsspecials available for free in short windows.[130]After an outcry from fans of the specials, Apple sublicensedA Charlie Brown ThanksgivingandA Charlie Brown ChristmastoPBSfor commercial-free airing.[131]In 2021,It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brownalso came to the PBS rotation. The PBS sublicensing arrangement ended before October 2022.[132]
In March 2024, Apple made 51 catalog films available under a "Great Movies special collection" banner.[133]
Apple has announced a number of partnerships, bundles, and initiatives to increase subscriber growth in the service.[when?]
It has included Apple TV+ in several reduced-cost bundles designed to increase uptake and stickiness of subscriptions, including a bundle with Apple Music available for students, a bundle offeringCBS All AccessandShowtimefor an additional $9.99 monthly for TV+ subscribers, and a bundling of the service as part of theApple Onesubscription package.[134][135][136]
It has partnered with largecable television MSOsand telecommunicationsmobile network operators, such asAltice USA,[137]the UK'sEE,[138]and Ireland'sEir TV,[139][140]to offer those systems' customers Apple TV+ as part of a bundle, sometimes including anApple TV 4Kset-top box.
By February 2020, about 10 million people had signed up for Apple TV+.[30][29]This included users who received a free one-year trial with the purchase of an Apple device,[30][29]although it was estimated that less than 10% of Apple device owners eligible for the trial had activated it, perhaps because of Apple's failure to promote the service, Apple's desire to slow the uptake rate due to accounting concerns, or users' lack of interest in the service's perceived poor content options.[30]About half of those 10 million users actively used the service.[31]In late 2020, the continuing expansion of availability of the Apple TV app to a growing number of smart TV platforms and to newer lines ofPlayStationandXboxvideo game consoles (specifically, thePS4andPS5, and the XboxOne,Series S, andSeries X[141]) was seen as potentially boosting subscriber numbers for Apple TV+, including as part of Apple One subscription bundle purchases.[142]But Apple has created no native TV app for theWindowsandAndroidplatformsor official method to stream the content toChromecastor on theAndroid TVplatform (except for selectSonyBraviatelevision models[143]), leaving users of those devices to use a web browser to view Apple TV+ content, where possible, or to employ other workarounds, especially for sending Apple TV+ content to a television set.[14]On December 16, 2020,Googleannounced it would add the Apple TV app to itsChromecast with Google TVdevice in early 2021 and to its Android TV platform by June 1, 2021;[144][145]Google made Apple TV available on its Chromecast with Google TV, as well as on selectSonyandTCLsmart TVsrunning the Google TV interface, on February 18, 2021.[146]On December 18, 2020, theBritish Urban Film Festivalannounced that it was to be the first UK film festival to host all of its official selections on theApple TV app.[147]

During the2023 Hollywood labor disputes, which took place from May 2 to November 9, A24 was approved to continue filming and promotional activities since they do not have ties to theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers(AMPTP).[57]
In October 2023,TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez exclusively reported that A24 is planning to expand its "strategy fromarthouse filmsto more commercial films", including "action and big IP projects". According to one production executive from the company, A24 "took a beating ondramas, especially the ones they made," the top agent said. The production exec added that A24 would still acquire dramas, but would move away from making as many of them. "Theauteurbusiness is a lousy, high-risk business that does not attract potential buyers ... That's a big problem if you're looking to sell or seek additional investment," another top agent toldTheWrap. This decision has been met with mixed responses from some journalists.[58][59]That same month, A24 forged an exclusive output deal with "Happinet Phantom Studios" covering the distribution in Japan of A24's upcoming releases; this marks A24's first major international theatrical output deal. The companies will also build A24brand awarenessacross the region, and deepen relationships with local talent and audiences off screen beyond film releases.[60]
In association withPrime VideoandFox Entertainment'sBento Box Entertainment, A24 launched its first animated project: the adult musical comedy seriesHazbin Hotel. The eight-episode first season premiered on January 19, 2024, on Prime Video; it received a two-season order.[61][62][63]However, the first episode was made available to watch, for free, onYouTubeon January 18, with the first four episodes subsequently released on Prime Video the following day as scheduled.[64]The series, which had been long in the works, is based on series creatorVivienne Medrano's animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019.Hazbin HotelfollowsCharlie Morningstar(voiced byErika Henningsen), the princess ofHell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitatingdemonsto peacefully reduceoverpopulationin her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed byangels, she opens ahotelin the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" intoHeaven.[61][65][66]At the 2023New York Comic Con, the cast was unveiled and it was announced that fans would be able to get digital access to the first two episodes at "HazbinHotel.com" before they were released on Prime Video, plus exclusive merchandise only available during the presale; early access episodes are available to stream for a limited time on the A24 App.[67]
In January, 2024, it was announced that A24 struck a deal withUnited Talent Agency(UTA) to produce scripted and unscripted television via the latter's Civic Center Media banner. The deal will see Civic Center Media given resources for development and production via A24. UTA stressed that Civic Center Media will work with talent from all agencies and UTA will continue to work with all studios, with A24 similarly continuing to work with all agencies. "We are excited to partner with A24," said UTA CEOJeremy Zimmer. "Their brand stands for quality and originality, and we believe the Civic Center Media collaboration will provide a great experience for writers, actors, directors and IP holders."[68]
Unlike traditional film production companies, when A24 launched in 2012 they did not have the substantive budgets required for marketing their films. Instead they opted for the lower cost digital marketing and social media as they recognised the reach of social media with minimal investment as opposed to more traditional forms of media from TV to radio and billboards. The rise of images and memes across X/Twitter and Instagram served as a means to build authenticity with its audience instead of the linear promotion of its films.[69]
In an interview with Contently, Zoe Beyer, the Creative Director who delivers the digital & social strategy for A24 revealed her approach:
"...For most of the content, I think of what will be relevant to people who like A24 movies. Fans of Harmony Korine or Sofia Coppola or Jonathan Glazer aren’t going to be offended if we use the word shit or poke fun at Hollywood or take a stab at Jaden Smith’s twitter activity.
Very occasionally, I will tweet something with no regard for whether it’s relevant to anyone besides myself. This is probably bad practice, but I think the film industry in particular can be so opaque, it is nice to know there are actual human personalities behind these companies. That’s why, sometimes, I will tweet about exotic pets or the NBA. The idea is just to keep it authentic."
As part of its commitment to sustainability with its productions, A24 has set up auctions as way for fans to bid on their favourite props, wardrobe items and set pieces from its films. The proceeds go to four charities which include:FDNY Foundation,Food Bank For New York City,NYC Health + Hospitals, andQueens Community House.[71]
A24 produces and distributes about 18 to 20 films annually.[22]It has also served as producer or distributor for several dozen television shows, includingAt Home with Amy Sedaris(2017–2020),Beef(2023),The Carmichael Show(2015–2017),Euphoria(2019–present),Hazbin Hotel(2024–present),I'm Sorry(2017–2019),Irma Vep(2022),Mo(2022–present),Mr. Corman(2021),Ramy(2019–2022), andZiwe(2021–2022).[10]
The action thrillerCivil War(2024), written and directed byAlex Garland, is A24's most expensive in-house production yet, holding a budget of $50 million.[72]The film is described as "an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through a near-future fractured America balanced on the razor's edge";Kirsten Dunststars in the lead role as a reporter.[73][74][75]Civil Warwas released in the United States on April 12, 2024, having been moved up from a release date of April 26, 2024.[76][77]
Everything Everywhere All at Once(2022) is currently A24's highest-grossing film and the first film of the company to cross the $100-million mark worldwide.[78]
The company distributes and produces artistic, psychologically disturbing, and mind-bendinghorror filmsoften referred to as "Art horror".[18][93][94][95]Most of these films share a similar approach, including ambiguity, bleak atmosphere, disruptive formulas, outbursts of violence, psychological dilemmas, and realistic character drama; these includeHereditary(2018),It Comes at Night(2017),The Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017),Men(2022),Under the Skin(2013), andThe Witch(2015).[96]The term also refers togenre filmswith a seemingly more artful sensibility than most fare, plus a focus on dramatic themes such as grief and trauma.[97]
However,John CarpenterandJordan Peele, filmmakers most commonly associated with horror, have denounced and rejected this term and style of horror. In an interview withThe A.V. Club, Carpenter was perplexed by the topic, saying: "I don't know what that means ... There's metaphorical horror. But all movies have. They don't have messages. They have themes. Thematic material and some horror films have thematic material. The good ones do."[98]In a separate conversion, Peele toldThe Verge: "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to make 'elevated' films. I think that's a trap that I don't quite appreciate."[97]
In October 2023, Scorsese revealed in an interview withThe Irish Timesthat Aster's films helped to inspire the tempo of his own filmKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), adding that timing is crucial for a film that's three-and-a-half hours long, stating: "I very much like the style and pacing of good horror films like Ari Aster'sMidsommarorBeau Is Afraid. The pacing of those films goes back to theB filmsofVal Lewton,Jacques Tourneur'sCat PeopleorI Walked with a Zombie. Just going a little slower, a little quieter".[99]
As of the97th Academy Awards, A24 has received a total of 76Academy Awardnominations, winning 18 overall.[49][100][101]
Additionally, A24 has been nominated and won numerousBritish Academy Film Awards,Critics' Choice Awards,Golden Globe Awards,Independent Spirit Awards, andScreen Actors Guild Awards.[106][107][108]
"A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited," said one high-level Hollywood executive.[who?]"They're not trying to becomeFocus [Features]. They want to become a big media company."[109]
FilmmakerDavid Lowery(director of A24'sA Ghost StoryandThe Green Knight) praised A24, saying: "The great thing about A24 is that they're always up for a challenge. They remain undaunted; they'll take the most difficult, unsaleable aspect of your movie and turn it into its greatest asset." Fellow filmmakerJames Ponsoldt(director of A24'sThe End of the TourandThe Spectacular Now) also applauded the company, saying: "A24 is remarkable at championing specific cinematic voices because they genuinely adore their films — and that enthusiasm is reflected in the creativity and laser-like precision of their marketing and releases."[17]
Many of the performances in A24 films have received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics and reviewers describing these actor/actress' performances as some of the best of their career.[110]Such performances include:Mahershala Ali's inMoonlight(2016),[111]Awkwafina's inThe Farewell(2019),[112]Toni Collette's inHereditary(2018),[113]Brendan Fraser's inThe Whale(2022),[114]Mia Goth's inX(2022) andPearl(2022),[115]Tom Hardy's inLocke(2013),[116]Brie Larson's inRoom(2015),[117]Greta Lee's inPast Lives(2023),[118]Robert Pattinson's inGood Time(2017) andThe Lighthouse(2019),[119]Joaquin Phoenix's inC'mon C'mon(2021) andBeau Is Afraid(2023),[120][121]Florence Pugh's inMidsommar(2019),[122]Saoirse Ronan's inLady Bird(2017),[123]Adam Sandler's inUncut Gems(2019),[124]Anya Taylor-Joy's inThe Witch(2015),[125]Alicia Vikander's inEx Machina(2014),[126]as well asKe Huy Quan,Michelle Yeoh, andStephanie Hsu's inEverything Everywhere All at Once(2022).[127][128]
A24 has frequently worked with many artistically minded writer-directors, for most of which the films released by the company pivoted their careers, includingAri Aster,Sean Baker, theDaniels,Robert Eggers,Alex Garland,Rose Glass,Joanna Hogg,Yorgos Lanthimos,David Lowery, and theSafdie brothers.[18][129][130][13]
Auteur filmmakers Aster—director/writer ofHereditary(2018),Midsommar(2019), andBeau Is Afraid(2023)—and Eggers—director/writer ofThe Lighthouse(2019) andThe Witch(2015)—are both notable for their contribution to and influence on modern horror, and partial reinvention and redefining of the genre.[13][131][132][133][134][135]Their films have dealt with and share a lot of similarities in some way, includingfolkloreorsupernaturalforces. Even with their strong similarities, there are differences as well; all three of Eggers' films areperiod pieceswhile Aster's all take place in modern times. Aster also seems to take conventional horror and put his own modern spin on it to inspire some genuinely uncomfortable fear in viewers while Eggers takes conventional horror and throws it out the window to transport viewers to another world with his uniquedialogueandcinematography.[13][136][137]Both have been cited as two of the top horror directors of the 2010s while their films have received widespread critical acclaim and deemed as some of the best horror films of the 2010s.[138][139][140]During a Q&A forBeau Is Afraidin 2023, renowned and veteran filmmakerMartin Scorsesedubbed Aster "one of the most extraordinary new voices in world cinema".[141]
Later in 2023,Talk to Me(2022), directed by twin brothersDanny and Michael Philippou, and released theatrically in the United States on July 28, became a triumphant success at thebox officeand surpassedHereditaryas A24's highest-grossing horror film domestically with a running total of $44.5 million on September 3.[142][143][144]The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, direction, horror sequences, practical effects, sound design, and performances.[145]In a statement toNewshub, filmmakerPeter Jacksonhighly praised the film, saying: "Talk to Meisn't just good – it's very very good. The best, most intense, horror movie I've enjoyed in years." Aster,Stephen King,George Miller, andSteven Spielberghave all praised the film as well.[146]A sequel is currently in development.[147]

Her films often deal with themes ofloneliness, wealth,privilege,isolation,youth,femininity, andadolescencein America. Coppola received theAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplayfor the comedy-dramaLost in Translation(2003), and was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Director,[c]becoming the third woman to do so.

In 2015, Coppola released theNetflixChristmas musical comedy specialA Very Murray Christmas, which earned her a nomination for thePrimetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie.[7]
Coppola was born in New York City on May 14, 1971,[8]the youngest child of documentarianEleanor(néeNeil) and filmmakerFrancis Ford Coppola. She is of Italian descent (Lucanian[9]andNeapolitan[10]) on her father's side[11]and was raised on her parents' farm inRutherford, California.[12]At 15, Coppola interned withChanel.[13]Coppola graduated fromSt. Helena High Schoolin 1989.[14]She first studied atMills Collegeand transferred to theCalifornia Institute of the Artsfrom 1993 to 1994 to focus on painting.[15]Thereafter, she attendedArt Center College of Design, where she was mentored byPaul Jasmin. After dropping out of college, Coppola started a clothing line called Milkfed, which is now sold exclusively in Japan.[16]
Coppola had many varying interests growing up, including fashion, photography, music, and design, and did not initially intend to become a filmmaker. However, after making her first short filmLick the Starin 1998, she realized it "brought together all the things [she] loved", and decided to continue her directing pursuits.[17]
Coppola's acting career, marked by frequent criticisms ofnepotismand negative reviews,[18][19]began while she was an infant, as she made background appearances in eight of her father's films. The best known of these is her appearance inThe Godfatheras the infant Michael Francis Rizzi, in the baptism scene.[20][21]Coppola also acted in her father's filmsThe Outsiders(1983), in a scene whereMatt Dillon,Tommy Howell, andRalph Macchioare eating at aDairy Queen;Rumble Fish(1983);The Cotton Club(1984); andPeggy Sue Got Married(1986), in which she portrayedKathleen Turner's sister Nancy.[22]Frankenweenie(1984) was the first film Coppola performed in that was not associated with her father, however, it often goes unnoticed due to her stage name "Domino", which she adopted at the time because she thought it was glamorous.[23]A short film entitledLife Without Zoe(1989), released as part of atripartiteanthology filmNew York Stories, was co-written by a teenage Coppola and her father; her father also directed the film.[24]
Coppola returned to her father'sGodfathertrilogy in both the second and thirdGodfatherfilms, playing an immigrant child inThe Godfather Part IIand playing Michael Corleone's daughter inThe Godfather Part IIIafter the originally cast actress,Winona Ryder, dropped out of the film at the last minute due tonervous exhaustion.[25][26][27][22]It has been suggested that Coppola's performance inThe Godfather Part IIIdamaged Francis Ford Coppola's career and ruined Sofia's before it had even begun.[28]Coppola has said that she never really wanted to act and only did it to help out when her father asked her to.[29]It has also been suggested that Sofia's role in the film may have affected its box office performance, which started strongly and then went into decline. Coppola herself worried that she had only been given the role because she was the director's daughter, and the role placed a strain on her during the time of shooting that her mother observed in a series of diaries she wrote forVogueduring the filming.[28]Coppola later stated that she was not hurt by the criticism from her work in the film because she never especially wanted an acting career.[30]
After she was critically panned for her performance inThe Godfather Part III(for which she was named "Worst Supporting Actress" and "Worst New Star" at the1990 Golden Raspberry Awards), Coppola largely ended her acting career. However, she did appear in the independent filmInside Monkey Zetterland(1992), as well as in the backgrounds of films by her friends and family (for example, she appeared asSaché, one of QueenPadmé Amidala's five handmaidens, inGeorge Lucas' 1999 filmStar Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace).[27]
Coppola also appeared in several 1990s music videos:the Black Crowes' "Sometimes Salvation";Sonic Youth's "Mildred Pierce";Madonna's "Deeper and Deeper";the Chemical Brothers' "Elektrobank", which was directed by her then-husbandSpike Jonze; and laterPhoenix's "Funky Squaredance".[31]
The Virgin Suicides(1999)
Coppola's first short film wasLick the Star(1998). It played many times on theIndependent Film Channel. She made her feature film directing debut withThe Virgin Suicides(1999); the film adaptation of the novelThe Virgin SuicidesbyJeffrey Eugenides. It received critical acclaim upon its premiere in North America at the 2000Sundance Film Festivaland was released later that year. Coppola was first drawn to the story after reading the book byJeffrey Eugenidesin 1995, at the recommendation of musicianThurston Moore. Coppola said she felt the novel's author understood the teenage experience. She has also said that if not for the book, she may not have had a career in film. Specifically, Coppola has highlighted the representation of teenagers "lazing around", a situation she connected with but felt was not seen very much in films in any relatable way. The story's theme of loss was a personal connection for Coppola in light of the 1986 death of her oldest brother in a boating accident, though she stated that she did not immediately realize this connection.[17]Coppola secured the rights to the novel and adapted the screenplay herself.[29]The low-budget film drew praise from critics[17]and represented the point at which Coppola became a filmmaker independent of her family connections.[29]She credits the start of her career to theCannesfestival after the film premiered there.[17]The film stars actorsDanny DeVito,Kirsten Dunst,Scott Glenn,Josh Hartnett,Michael Paré,Jonathan Tucker,Kathleen Turner, andJames Woods.[32]
Coppola's second featureLost in Translation(2003) won her theAcademy Awardfor best original screenplay and threeGolden Globe Awardsincluding Best Picture Musical or Comedy. AfterLina WertmüllerandJane Campion, Coppola became the third female director to be nominated for an Academy Award for Directing and the second to win the Original Screenplay award, after Campion in 1994 (Wertmüller was also nominated). Her win for the best original screenplay in 2003 made her a third-generation Oscar winner. Coppola was the second woman, afterEdith Head, to be nominated for three Oscars in one night. In 2004, Coppola was invited to join theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[33]Coppola shotLost in Translationin 27 days,[34]with a small crew, working without permits. Scenes were filmed impromptu on the street, while scenes shot at thePark Hyatt Hotelallowed the crew to use its corridors between two and three in the morning without disturbing guests.[35]
The film received positive reception and acclaim, though also generated controversy due the film's usage "of Japan as an exotic and bizarre landscape for its American protagonists". The group Asian Mediawatch lobbied against the film's Academy Award nominations, stating "The film has no meaningful Japanese roles, nor is there any significant dialogue between the main characters and the Japanese. Such portrayals perpetuate negative stereotypes and attitudes that are harmful to Asian Americans in the US, where a significant minority of Americans already have negative attitudes towards Asians."[36]Coppola responded to these allegations in an interview forThe Independent, "I can see why people might think that, but I know I'm not racist. I think if everything's based on truth, you can make fun, have a little laugh, but also be respectful of a culture. I just love Tokyo, and I'm not mean-spirited...Even on our daily call sheets, they would mix up the 'rs' and the 'ls' – all that was from experience, it's not made up. I guess someone has misunderstood my intentions. It bugs me, because I know I'm not racist."[37]
Her third film was thebiopicMarie Antoinette(2006), adapted from the biography by British historianAntonia Fraser.Kirsten Dunstplays the titular character andJason Schwartzman, Coppola's cousin, playsKing Louis XVI. The film debuted at the2006 Cannes Film Festival[38]where, despite boos in the audience, it received a standing ovation.[39]Though critics were divided at the time of its release, it has since received a cult following and more critical acclaim in the years that followed.[40]Peter Bradshaw ofThe Guardiandeclared, "Sofia Coppola's presentation of Marie's life has a sisterly, unjudging intimacy, and the director has carried off pert inventions and provocations with some style, combining dazzling visual tableaux and formal set-pieces in strict period, with new wave chart hits from the 1970s and 80s: these musical anachronisms lending ironic torsion to the overall effect."[41]
Marie Antoinettewas shot on location at theChâteau de Versailles. Coppola herself has claimed that she was initially drawn towards the character ofMarie Antoinetteas an innocent and caring character who found herself in a situation outside of her control, and that rather than creating a historical representation, she wanted to create a more intimate look into the world of the heroine.[42]Coppola was interested in making an emotional connection to the young royalty whose "coming-of-age took place under conditions familiar to a pampered zoo animal".[43]The film's style is not that of a traditionalbiopic, and instead utilizes "hit songs and incongruous dialogue".[44]The film received theAcademy Award for Best Costume Designas well as threeBAFTA Awardsnominations.
Coppola's fourth film wasSomewhere(2010), filmed atChateau Marmont. The plot focuses on a "bad boy" actor Marco (portrayed byStephen Dorff) who is forced to reevaluate his life when his daughter Cleo (played byElle Fanning) arrives unexpectedly.[45]The relationship between Marco and Cleo was loosely based on Coppola's own relationship with her father.[46]The film won the prestigiousGolden Lionat theVenice Film Festival. In November 2010, Coppola was interviewed byJoel Coen, who professed his admiration of her work, at the DGA screening ofSomewherein New York City.[47]
Somewheredepicts a newly famous actor (Stephen Dorff) recuperating from a minor injury whose wealth, fame, and professional experiences cannot alleviate the existential crisis he is experiencing, as he is forced to care for his 11-year-old daughter in the absence of his wife. The film premiered at the67th Venice International Film Festival, and opened in the rest of Italy, on September 3, 2010. The festival jury unanimously awarded the film theGolden Lionprize for the best overall film.Quentin Tarantino, president of the jury, said the film "grew and grew in our hearts, in our minds, in our affections" after the first screening. The film continued to receive critical acclaim, especially from notable film criticRoger Ebertof theChicago Sun-Timeswho praised the detail in the portrait of Johnny Marco, writing, "Coppola is a fascinating director. She sees, and we see exactly what she sees. There is little attempt here to observe a plot. All the attention is on the handful of characters, on Johnny."[48]
Coppola's next film,The Bling Ring(2013), was based on actual events centered around theBling Ring, a group of California teenagers who burgled the homes of several celebrities over 2008 and 2009, stealing around $3 million in cash and belongings.[49]Emma Watson,[50]Taissa Farmiga,[51]Leslie Mann,Israel Broussard,[52]Katie Chang, and Claire Julien starred in the film, which premiered at the2013 Cannes Film Festival, opening theUn Certain Regardsection.[53][54]It was inspired by aVanity Fairfeature on thereal-life criminalsdepicted in the film,[55]whom Coppola described as "products of our growing reality TV culture".[56]The film received generally positive reviews, with many praising its style and performances. While some felt that the film glamorized the crimes in the story and failed to make an assertive message about them through the narrative; "Coppola neither makes a case for her characters nor places them inside of some kind of moral or critical framework; they simply pass through the frame, listing off name brands and staring at their phones".[57]
Coppola collaborated again with herLost in TranslationstarBill MurrayonA Very Murray Christmas, which stars Murray and was co-written by herself, Murray andMitch Glazer. The film, an homage to classicChristmas-themedvariety shows, was released in December 2015 onNetflix.[58]
Coppola directedThe Beguiled(2017), a remake of the 1971eponymous Southern Gothic film, starringNicole Kidman,Elle Fanning, andKirsten Dunst.[59]The film premiered at the2017 Cannes Film Festival, where Coppola became the second woman (and the first American woman) to win theBest Director award.[2][3]The film is based on the 1966 book of the same name by authorThomas P. Cullinanabout a woundedUnionsoldier in a Mississippiseminaryduring theAmerican Civil War,[60]and was made for under $10 million.[61]The film exhibited elements of thethrillergenre, another departure for Coppola.[60]
Coppola cited her intrigue with theSouthas part of the story's appeal. Coppola has said that she "wanted the film to represent an exaggerated version of all the ways women were traditionally raised there just to be lovely and cater to men—the manners of that whole world, and how they change when the men go away". Coppola has citedGone with the Windas her inspiration for creating a film that was relatable despite its position within a different era.[60]The film faced a wave of controversy and division, including accusations of 'whitewashing' the original story after Coppola removed the supporting role of a black female slave from the film, as well as choseKirsten Dunstto portray a character who was biracial in the original novel. Coppola also faced criticism for minimizing the story of the people experiencing actual hardship in favor of depicting, albeit authentically, the lavish lifestyle of her protagonists, thus minimizing the importance of a weighty topic. Coppola responded to these allegations by citing the presence of young girls among her movie-going audience.The Beguiledis not the only of Coppola's films to be accused of exposing the socio-cultural affordances of her own childhood.[60]
Coppola described her version of the film as a reinterpretation, rather than a remake, ofDon Siegel's1971 adaptionof the same book.[60]Coppola wanted to tell the story of the male soldier entering into a classically southern and female environment from the point of view of the women and represent what that was like for them.[60][29]Coppola thought that the earlier version made the characters out to be crazy caricatures and did not allow the viewer to know them.[60]While some critics claim that Coppola intendedThe Beguiledas a feminist work, Coppola explained that she is not in favor of that labeling. Though she has said she is happy if others see the film in this way, she sees it as a film, rather, that possesses a female perspective—an important distinction.The Beguiledwas also made as a contrast toThe Bling Ring, and Coppola has explained that
she needed to correct that film's harshLos Angelesaesthetic with something more beautiful and poetic.[60]
Coppola's film,On the Rocks,[62][63]tells the story of a daughter and father, played byRashida JonesandBill Murrayrespectively, as they explore New York together in an attempt to mend their fractured relationship.[64][65]It was released in alimited theatrical releaseon October 2, 2020, byA24and was released for digital streaming on October 23, 2020, byApple TV+.[66]
The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised Coppola's screenplay and direction, and noted it as lighter than her previous films.[67]Some critics stated that the film "isn't destined to achieve the same kind of iconic status as some of Coppola's previous work".[68]
An announcement in mid-December 2013 stated thatAmerican Zoetropehad successfully attained the screen rights for the memoirFairyland: A Memoir of My Fatherand that Coppola would adapt the book with Andrew Durham. Coppola would also produce the film with her brother Roman.[69]Coppola would later drop out of directing duties while remaining herself as a producer, as Durham took over as the sole director and writer for the film.[70]
The film, titledFairylandand starringEmilia JonesandScoot McNairy, premiered at the 2023Sundance Film Festival[71]to positive reviews.
Coppola's next film,Priscilla(2023), her eighth as a director, is based on the life ofPriscilla Presleyand her 1985 memoirElvis and Me. It starsCailee Spaenyas Priscilla andJacob ElordiasElvis Presley. The film is distributed byA24and premiered at the80th Venice International Film Festivalin September 2023.[72]
The film dives into the life ofPriscilla Presley, allowing viewers to take a look into Priscilla's relationship withElvis Presley. Unlike the filmElvis(2022) byBaz Luhrmann, the film does not portray Elvis positively or much of his successful career. Instead, it portrays Elvis' "darker, domestic side".[73]Coppola was more interested in showing Priscilla's side of their relationship, highlighting the terror of Elvis' physical and emotional abuse towards Priscilla.[74]
The film received positive reviews, withRolling Stonedeclaring the film to be her best sinceLost in Translation.[75]David Rooney ofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote, "Coppola has always been a filmmaker who coaxes out feelings rather than blasts them with emphatic declarations, and the nuanced restraint of her writing and direction here are very much points in Priscilla's favor."[76]
Coppola stated that she used her teenage years growing up in the Bay Area to inform her position in this role. She stated specifically about her time as a teenager, "I just remember everything being epic and important and with a lot of feeling and driving around and listening to music. Your senses are more heightened or something."[77]
In the mid-1990s, Coppola and her best friendZoe Cassaveteshelmed the short-livedComedy CentralseriesHi Octane, which spotlit performers inunderground music. The show was cancelled after four episodes.[78]

The July 2013 issue ofEllefeatured photographs shot by Coppola ofParis Hiltonat Hilton'sBeverly Hillsmansion (Both model and house appear inThe Bling Ring).[85][86]
In 2017, before Coppola started pre-production onThe Beguiled, she was asked by Italian state broadcaster Rai Com from All'Opera to direct their latest production ofLa Traviata.La Traviatais a three act opera byGiuseppe Verdiset to an Italian libretto byFrancesca Maria Piave. This Coppola-directed production was filmed for broadcast in Germany and France by Arte/ZDF, using multiple state-of-the art 4k cameras and up to 100 microphones.[87]Coppola said in an interview she "could not turn down the project" with designer and fashion iconValentino Garavanidesigning the costumes for this 15 show run ofLa Traviata(2017).[88]Discussing her modern take on this classic story Coppola says "I wanted to bring out the personal side of the French courtesan, the party girl used to the social scene. It's a very feminine world that I love".[89]
This was the first stage production Coppola directed.[88]Coppola discusses how Valentino "really motivated me to take a chance and do something that was scary for me and very unfamiliar," and promised a "traditional" production that could nevertheless be appreciated by those who are not opera connoisseurs. Rome Opera House Director Carlo Fuortes said in an interview ticket sales had exceeded 1.2 million euros (1.35 million dollars), a record for the establishment.[90]
All fifteen shows nearly sold out before opening night.[89]It was the biggest box office success since theTeatro dell'Opera Di Romaopened in 1880.[89]

Coppola and her family lived inParisfor several years before moving toNew York Cityin 2010.[100]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal.
