Reclusive academic Augustine Lofthouse has devoted his life to findinghabitable planetsso humanity can expand. He meets Jean Sullivan after giving a presentation at a gala and they form a romantic relationship. After a pregnancy scare, she leaves him due to his work obsession and inability to bond with others. Several years later, when Lofthouse encounters Jean again, she tells him about their daughter, whom he chooses not to meet.
Thirty years later, in 2049, an event has obliterated most of Earth's population and left the surface contaminated withionizing radiation. Lofthouse is the only person inhabiting a largeArcticbase. A flashback shows him refusing to join the evacuation, knowing he does not have long to live due to an unidentified serious illness requiringhemodialysisand medical equipment at the base.
Lofthouse searches the base's computer systems for activecrewed space missionsto warn about the situation on Earth and finds only one: the interplanetary craftAether, returning from an exploration ofJupiter's habitable moon K-23, which Lofthouse discovered.
In the meantime, the crew ofAetherare oblivious to events on Earth and believe they have lost contact due to faulty communications systems. Lofthouse finds his antenna is too weak to contact them, even after calculating them to be in range.
Along with his deteriorating physical health, Lofthouse is experiencing mental blackouts. After a kitchen fire, he finds a young mute girl hiding in the kitchen. He tries to contact the evacuees to get someone to get her, to no avail. The girl draws anirisand Lofthouse deduces that this is her name.
Lofthouse grows fond of Iris, and they travel together on asnowmobileto another base which has a larger, more powerful antenna. En route, in an accident, he loses his medical equipment. Arriving at the base, he manages to make contact withAether, but anasteroidfield damages the ship'sradarand communication systems.
To repair the damage,mission specialistSully, currently pregnant, and her partner, Commander Adewole, conduct aspacewalkwithflight engineerMaya. They repair the communications and radar but are caught in a second asteroid field that fatally injures Maya.
Sully contacts Lofthouse. He tells her not to return to Earth because of the disaster, but go back to K-23 and start a new life there.Aether's pilot, Tom Mitchell, refuses, but upon discovering his wife's final words and seeing the state of Earth's atmosphere, he understands that it is in the crew's best interests to go back to Jupiter's moon. Still, he chooses to use one of the twore-entry vehiclesto return to Earth. Sanchez, who saw Maya as a second daughter, decides to accompany him and bury her body on Earth.
In her final communication with Lofthouse, Sully tells him that he was one of the reasons she joinedNASA. She thanks him, telling him her mother Jean had given her amoon rockfrom him, and that her full name is Iris Sullivan. Lofthouse says he already knew her name, making it clear that the young girl he had been seeing was not real. When asked how he ended up at the base from which he contactedAether, he says he thought he might be able to "helpsomeone" (implying he followedAether'smission not only because he discovered that moon, but also because it was his daughter Sully's mission).
Lofthouse tells Sully he is proud to have finally met her, and she describes K-23 to him. Her description transports him there in his imagination and he falls out of radio contact. Sully and Adewole are left with nothing but to return to K-23 using a course provided by Lofthouse.

On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 49% of 252 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's consensus reads: "The Midnight Skylacks the dramatic heft to match its narrative scale, but its flaws are often balanced by thoughtful themes and a poignant performance from director-star George Clooney."[23]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 58 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[24]
Alonso DuraldeofTheWrapwrote "There's a lot that's frustrating about George Clooney's new filmThe Midnight Sky, from its egregious borrowing from any number of better movies to its pacing issues, but thanks to a few grace notes, its shortcomings are mostly forgivable".[25]Leah Greenblatt ofEntertainment Weeklygave the film a B and described it as "a dystopian drama whose fluctuating tone—grim, with flickers of hopeful sentiment—feels almost comfortingly familiar, if a little on the nose for 2020."[26]
The Wall Street Journalreviewer Joe Morganstern gave the film a warm review but added, "The film isn't perfect. The narrative piles crisis upon crisis, from a fat fire in the observatory kitchen to spectacular repair efforts in space and a startling sequence that involves droplets of blood. The pace, paradoxically, can be awfully slow, but it may seem less so to home viewers with plenty of time and patience; the metabolic rate of motion pictures will be changing in the streaming era, to an extent we can't foresee."[27]Brian Tallerico ofRogerEbert.comreviewed the film more harshly and gave it two stars, concluding, "The heart of this movie just isn't there. It's as weightless as space."[28]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
Amélie of Leuchtenberg(1812–1873) was a French noblewoman andEmpress of Brazilas the wife ofEmperor Pedro I. She was the fourth child ofEugène de Beauharnaisand his wifePrincess Augusta of Bavaria. After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after. Pedro died in 1834 and Amélie did not remarry, living the rest of her life in Portugal. This oil-on-canvas portrait of Amélie, produced in the 1830s by the German painterFriedrich Dürck, is now in theSoares dos Reis National MuseuminPorto, Portugal.
