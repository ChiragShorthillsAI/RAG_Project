It was released in alimited releaseon October 2, 2020, followed byvideo on demandon October 6, 2020, byParamount Pictures. It received positive reviews from critics.
During a senior calculus class at Covington High, senior student Katelyn Ogden inexplicably explodes, spraying the surrounding students and classroom with blood. The police take the class into custody during an investigation, but aside from ruling out an attack, are unable to determine the cause of the explosion. During custody, senior student Mara Carlyle suggests to the class that it could happen again, a sentiment taken seriously by her peers. Afterwards, an unknown person texts her, claiming to have had a crush on her for several years.
Following Katelyn's funeral service, Mara gets high onmushroomspurchased from school dealers, Jenna and Joe Dalton, and goes for tea with her best friend Tess; fellow student Dylan approaches the pair and reveals himself to be the unknown texter who said they had a crush on Mara. Dylan explains how he had begun thinking of life and how quickly it could end, and upon hearing Mara's suggestion of the incident repeating itself, realized that he needed to take action.
They begin seeing one another and attend a school football game and house party, although each is cut short when a jock, Perry Love, and drink server, Cranberry Bollinger, respectively explode, sending the attendees into a panic. Classes are cancelled for a while, and people begin to dub the explosions "The Covington Curse". The incidents attract the attention of numerous government agencies, who placeFBIAgent Carla Rosetti on the case; she enlists Mara and Tess as aid.
While investigating the possible involvement of drugs, Mara goes for a drive with the school dealers, the Dalton twins; they explode and the car crashes. Dylan arrives and consoles a dazed Mara, before federal agents arrive inprotective suitsand detain them. The entire senior class is placed under observation while the government devises a "Snooze Button" pill to "cure" the students, during which multiple students explode. Realizing they should live like every day might be their last, Mara and Dylan continue seeing each other, pursuing ahedonisticlifestyle; they have sex and dance to Eighties music in an old barn.
School resumes for the senior class, although the townspeople begin to fear the students and Agent Rosetti inadvertently admits to Mara that the explosions may not yet be over. While demonstrating the supposed effectiveness of the pill at a school seminar, a volunteer student explodes, triggering a chain reaction of explosions in the classroom. Dozens of students explode during the ensuing rampage, whereas Mara and Dylan are separated by the mob in a struggle to escape the building. After reuniting with Mara, Dylan explodes, injuring her in the process.
Following Dylan's death, a despondent Mara turns to alcohol, and in the ensuing weeks drunkenly falls out with her parents and Tess, as well as accidentally breaking Agent Rosetti's car window with a stolen bottle ofwhiskey. Mara also reads student comments online speculating that she might be the Covington Curse, as she was present at the scene of each occurring explosion. At the combined graduation/prom ceremony, Mara reconciles with Tess, who reveals that she is leaving town for a beach house that night and invites her to come. Believing herself to be the curse, Mara casually apologizes to the attendees for causing the explosions, but others chime in, claiming responsibility over circumstantial personal problems. Leaving the event, Mara visits Dylan's grave, and has a heart-to-heart conversation with his mother, who convinces her to move on with her life. Mara apologizes to her parents and sobers up.
After the rampage, the next version of "Snooze Button" pill seems to be effective and the explosions stop anticlimactically, leaving 31 students in the senior class dead. Covington High is closed by the authorities and scheduled for demolition. Mara gains possession of Dylan's milk van and – with her parents' blessing – moves into the beach house with Tess, as they had intended to do since childhood. The film ends with Mara telling the viewers to enjoy life while it lasts, as, "The fuck else can you do?"
In addition, the drug dealing siblings, Jenna and Joe, are played byLaine MacNeiland Clive Holloway, respectively.

AwesomenessTV Holdings, LLC, often shortened toAwesomeness, is an Americandigital mediaandentertainmentnetwork company owned byParamount Global. Established in July 2012 byBrian RobbinsandJoe Davola, the company operated a network initially focused on children’s programs, teen dramas, comedies, live events and music videos targeting adolescents and young adults.
AwesomenessTV initially operated an eponymousYouTubechannel andmulti-channel network. The company later expanded into talent,branded content, music, publishing and retail. In 2013,DreamWorks Animation(DWA) acquired AwesomenessTV. In 2014,Hearst Communicationsacquired a 25% minority stake. In 2016,Verizon Communicationsacquired another roughly-quarter stake in the company for $159 million (valuing it at $650 million), while AwesomenessTV entered into a multi-year deal to produce content for Verizon's streaming video servicego90.
In 2018, followingNBCUniversal's acquisition of DWA (which led to conflict due to being owned by Verizon competitorComcast) and the shutdown of the fledgling go90, Viacom acquired AwesomenessTV for around $50 million – a fraction of its 2016 valuation. Since its purchase by Viacom, the studio has focused more on long-form television series and films forover-the-top services, and has referred to itself as targetinggeneration Z.
In July 2012, foundersBrian RobbinsandJoe Davola[3]launched AwesomnessTV as part of theYouTube Original Channel Initiative, producing various web series oriented towards atweenandteenageaudience. Robbins had personally observed his two sons as examples of changing media consumption trends among the demographic, which had increasingly favored short-form internet video over television.[4]
Robbins had been well known for his work on series such asOne Tree Hill,Smallville, and severalNickelodeonseries, such as the sketch comedyAll That. In 2009, Robbins spearheaded the production ofa filmbased on YouTube comedianLucas Cruikshank's characterFred. Robbins and Cruikshank bankrolled it as anindependent filmfor Nickelodeon—where it became the highest-rated basic-cable film of the year among youth in 2010 and spawned alarger franchiseof Nickelodeon content featuring the character.[4]
The channel had an initial slate of 15 series in development, including the talk showIMO;the stunt showsThe Blow-Up Guys, teen dramaThe Runaways, andAwesomeness Sports(a series of videos that would feature professional athletes and showcase youth athletes).[4]Davola compared the channel toMTVupon its launch, explaining that "it was maverick, it was brand new, it was something the young people were getting involved with."[4]
Brett Bouttier joined as a chief operating officer in November 2012.[5]In December 2012, AwesomenessTV launched amulti-channel networktargeting similar demographics.[6]
On May 1, 2013,DreamWorks Animationannounced its intent to acquire AwesomenessTV for $33 million. It was also announced that AwesomenessTV would develop and operate a YouTube channel focusing on content from DWA's franchises.[7]In October 2013, the company partnered with the teen magazineSeventeento operate its YouTube channel.[8]
In April 2014, AwesomenessTV acquired the MCN and talent management company Big Frame for $15 million.[9]That month, the company also hired formerClaire'sCEO James Fielding to lead a new consumer products division.[10]In June 2014, AwesomenessTV launched DreamWorksTV, a YouTube channel that featured shorts and original series relating to DreamWorks franchises (such asShrek, and theDreamWorks Classicslibrary), as well as supplemental content promoting its upcoming films.[11]The following month, therecord labelAwesomeness Music was announced, in partnership withUniversal Music Group.[12]
In September 2014, AwesomenessTV partnered with the department store chainKohl'sto launch a teen fashion line co-branded with its web seriesLife's S.o. R.a.d., as its first consumer product line.[13][14]In October 2014, AwesomenessTV launched the publishing label AwesomenessInk,[15]andNetflixordered a live-actionRichie Richsitcom from AwesomenessTV as part of an ongoing development deal with DWA.[16]In December 2014,SeventeenpublisherHearst Corporationacquired a 25% stake in the company for $81.25 million.[17]
In June 2015, the company hired formerLionsgateexecutiveMatt Kaplanas president of Awesomeness Films.[18]In August 2015, AwesomenessTV announced an output deal with Canadian children's media conglomerateDHX Media, in which the companies would co-develop and license new original content, with DHX handling international distribution and merchandising. DHX also began to acquire the studio's programming to air on its owned television networkFamily Channel.[19][20]
On April 6, 2016,Verizon Communications—which had acquired several series from the studio (such asGuidance) for its ad-supported streaming servicego90—acquired a 24.5% stake in AwesomenessTV for $159 million, valuing the company at $650 million. Alongside the equity stake, the deal included a multi-year, $180 million investment for the studio to produce content for Verizon, for which it would hold exclusive U.S. distribution rights. Verizon and AwesomenessTV also planned to launch a branded, subscription-based video service targeting mobile devices.[21][22]

As NBCUniversal's parent company Comcast competed directly with Verizon, the two companies were unwilling to be in a joint venture with each other. The two companies had also become uninterested in the venture, as the exits of Brian Robbins and DWA CEOJeffrey Katzenberghad lessened the appeal of the venture to Verizon, while Comcast did not think that the company was one of DWA's core assets, or fit alongside its other digital media investments (such asBuzzFeed). The company had planned a downsizing under its new CEOJordan Levin.[22]
On July 25, 2018,Viacomannounced that it was in talks to acquire AwesomenessTV for a fraction of the company's $650 million valuation in 2016.[28][29]Two days later, on July 27, Viacom officially announced the purchase, with a valuation initially reported to be $25 million plus the assumption of debt, but later $50 million.[30]Operations of DreamWorksTV were taken in-house by NBCUniversal Direct-to-Consumer and Digital Enterprises after the purchase.[31][32]Jordan Levin left his position as CEO following the acquisition.[1][2]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)
