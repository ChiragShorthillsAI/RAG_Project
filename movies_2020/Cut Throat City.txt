He is thede factoleader of the hip hop groupWu-Tang Clan,[4]having produced most of the group's albums and those of its members. Known for his signature use ofsoulsamples, sparse beats, and cinematic elements, his production style has been widely influential in hip-hop.The SourceandVibeboth ranked him among the greatest hip-hop producers of all time,[5][6]whileNMEincluded him on its list of the 50 Greatest Producers Ever, spanning all genres.[7]
RZA has released solo albums under the alter-egoBobby Digitaland was a founding member of thehorrorcoregroupGravediggaz, performing asthe RZArector. He has also worked extensively in film and television, composing scores for major films such asKill Bill: Volume 1(2003) andKill Bill: Volume 2(2004). He made his directorial debut withThe Man with the Iron Fists(2012) and later directedLove Beats Rhymes(2017). He served as anexecutive produceronWu-Tang: An American Saga(2019–2023), for which he received aPrimetime Emmy Awardnomination forOutstanding Original Main Title Theme Music.
As an actor, he has appeared inAmerican Gangster(2007),G.I. Joe: Retaliation(2013), andA Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas(2011), as well as the TV seriesCalifornication. He has also done voiceover work, including roles inThe SimpsonsandMinions: The Rise of Gru(2022).
Diggs was born on July 5, 1969, inBrownsville, Brooklyn. He was named after the Kennedy brothersRobertandJohn Fitzgerald, both of whom his mother greatly admired.[8]Diggs has called his given name an "honorable" name, given the legacy of both Robert and John. Diggs has a younger brother, Terrance Hamlin, better known as the rapper9th Prince, and an older brother named Mitchell “Divine” Diggs.
From ages three to seven, Diggs spent summers inNorth Carolinawith his uncle, who encouraged him to read and study.[9]Diggs was introduced tohip hop musicat the age of nine, and by eleven, was competing inrap battles. He relocated toSteubenville, Ohio, in 1990, to live with his mother. He spent weekends inPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his father ran a convenience store in the city'sHill District.[10]
Diggs got involved with petty crime and drug-dealing, and was charged with attempted murder while in Steubenville. He was acquitted of the charge, giving him what he has called a "second chance".[11]
Diggs first became interested in making his own hip-hop music in 1979 when a friend of his introduced him toRapper's DelightbyThe Sugarhill Gangand in 1984, Diggs formed a rap group with his cousinsRussell Jones, then known as The Specialist, andGary Grice, then known as Allah Justice, called "Force of the Imperial Master", which they soon after renamed as"All in Together Now"in 1985. Around this time Diggs formed the DMD Posse which consisted of RZA, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, U-God,Inspectah Deck, 4th Disciple andMethod Man.[1]Diggs and Grice then signed with Jamaica Records for management purposes and Jamaica convincedTommy Boy Recordsto sign Diggs as a solo artist in 1989 under the namePrince Rakeem.[1]He released the originalOoh I Love You Rakeempromotion version of the EP, but was forced to remix and rerelease the single when Tommy Boy failed to acquire the rights to the original sample. The rereleased version underperformed commercially, and Diggs was subsequently dropped by Tommy Boy.[1]
After a shoot-out in Ohio in 1992, he faced eight years in jail. "When they said 'not guilty', my face stuck in a smile for three days," he recalled. "I was just walking around town, thinking about my daughter and my wife. Right then I said goodbye to anything that would put me in that situation again. I was up on trial on anattempted murdercharge. I was a motherfucking fool, with all that knowledge in my head and ending up there."[12]In 1992, Diggs formed a new group with his two cousins and five other childhood friends. They named the groupWu-Tang Clan, after the 1983kung fufilmShaolin and Wu Tang. As part of the group's formation, each member chose a new nickname for themselves. Diggs chose "RZA", based on a nickname he had been given by fans of his music, "Rza Rza Rakeem", which in turn was based on a song by All in Together Now, "Pza Pza Pumpin", as well as Diggs'graffiti tag, "Razor". He created abackronymfor "RZA", stating that the name stood for "Ruler, Zig-Zag-Zig, Allah" which further translated into "Ruler, Knowledge-Wisdom-Understanding, Allah" when using theSupreme Alphabet.[13]
Wu-Tang Clan released its first single, "Protect Ya Neck", in December 1992.Masta Killathen joined the group in 1993, becoming its ninth member. They released their debut album,Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)in November 1993.[14]RZA operated as Wu-Tang Clan's de facto leader, producing the group's songs and deciding who would get placed on which tracks.
As each of the group's members embarked on solo careers, RZA continued to produce nearly everything Wu-Tang released during the period 1994–1996, which included both composing and arranging the instrumental tracks as well as overseeing and directing the creative process. RZA's rule over the Clan at this time is described in 2004'sWu-Tang Manualbook as "a dictatorship". He also released a hit single of his own, in the form of "Wu-Wear: The Garment Renaissance". The song was featured on theHigh School Highsoundtrack, and was released to promote the Wu-Tang clothing brand, also called "Wu-Wear". It peaked at #60 on theBillboardHot 100, and #6 on theHot Rap Singleschart.[15]
When it came time for the Gravediggaz,Prince Paulwas thinking about putting a group together. He wanted to get some good MCs.Poeticwas another dope MC who was underrated out onLong Island. He had one single out on Tommy Boy that didn't take off, but he was a dope MC. As the Grym Reaper, you know how many dope lyrics he dropped. Frukwan, one of the top lyricists out ofStetsasonic. He and Paul were friends already. He told him about me. He said, "I know this one guy who is super-dope."
At the same time, I was also trying to do Wu-Tang. I was trying to start my own company and stuff, so when Paul called me up and invited me to his crib on Long Island and told me his idea for forming this group, I thought it would be an honor to be in a group with him. But I told him, "I'm also producing a group, and I'm also part of a family that I'm building." He said, "Yo, that's crazy." We would talk a lot of times. [Ol' Dirty Bastard] came to his house a lot of times with me. [Method Man], too. We all would just go there and try to find ways to get out of the streets. Me, I was trying to get out of the ghetto. Paul had a lot of respect for me, so he helped me break out of it. I think he liked that I was so dark, but I didn't know I was dark.[16]
1997 saw the release ofWu-Tang Forever, the Wu-Tang Clan's highly anticipated second album. The album for the first time featured RZA delegating a small number of beat-making duties to other producers in the Wu-Tang camp, such as his protégésMathematics,True Masterand4th Disciplewho are known as the originalWu-Elements, and Clan memberInspectah Deck.[17]
During the 1998–2000 period RZA ceased to produce every Wu-Tang solo album as he had done previously, but continued to contribute usually one or two songs on average to each record as well as receiving an Executive Producer credit.
"I had to put outBobby Digitalinstead ofThe Curebecause if I didn't do that I would've suffered two things. First, I would have revealed where I was musically too soon. Wu-Tang is the perfect medium to expose anything new because I got the most people coming together to buy it. For me to expose it for my own self, I don't think that would've been a wise thing for me to do. I might've caught more people than Bobby Digital caught, but I still wouldn't catch the magnitude of what the Wu-Tang could catch. Maybe this year or next year the game may be different.The Cureis so intimate in writing that you gotta live that Cure shit. I was living like Bobby Digital in '98, '99 na'mean? So if I put "The Cure" out, then I wouldn't even be able to get on stage and perform it for ya'll cause I'd be lying."
In 1999 the RZA moved into composing film scores. His first work,Jim Jarmusch'sGhost Dog: The Way of the Samurai(1999), earned praise; he also had a brief cameo in the film itself, as a fellow samurai wearing camouflage. The experience was positive and, as he noted during an interview onNational Public Radio'sFresh Air, the work with traditional musicians gave him the desire to learn how to read and write music.[18]In 2004, he co-scoredDavid S. Goyer's"Blade: Trinity"with composerRamin Djawadi.
This is one of my biggest adventures, and one of my [best] feelings. We watchedKill BillinManhattan. At the premiere, that happened, but you know, that's Hollywood. But in Manhattan, a theater, just a bunch of kids coming from wherever New York, inside a movie theater and the movie's coming on. They don't even know that I'm the man with the music, and when it said, "Original Music by The RZA", we hear the audience clapping. And they didn't clap for nothing else, because the movie's just coming on. I was like, 'Wow, what the fuck is that about?' That's different. It actually might be something special. You never care who did that... Once you see who stars in the shit, you don't read "edited", you don't read all that. You be eating your popcorn and it go right by you. But, for somebody to see that and then clap, that's a different thing right there. That felt pretty pleasing.
He has also stated that the long-delayedThe Curealbum will be his final solo album, so that he can devote more time to his movie directing career.[19]
Before signing withSRC Recordsin 2007, RZA was flooded with offers fromBad Boy Records,Aftermath Records,InterscopeandDef Jamamong others for the Wu-Tang Clan super-group.[20]
In 2007, he produced thescoreof the Japanese animeAfro SamuraistarringSamuel L. Jackson. In 2007 he released the little-publicized instrumental albumThe RZA-Instrumental Experience, and worked with Raekwon on his highly anticipatedOnly Built 4 Cuban Linx II. From 2005 to 2008 he collaborated withSystem of a DownbassistShavo Odadjianon the projectAchozen[21]The group released two singles, one of which, "Deuces", was included in the 2009 filmBabylon A.D.The group also recorded an album that has remained unreleased, although eight of the songs were released in 2015.
"The time is right to bring some older material to the masses digitally. Our fans have been dedicated and patient, and they're hungry to hear the music that has set us apart from so many others.Hip-hopis alive inWu Music, and with The Orchard, we've got a solid partner that understands our audience and is committed to doing all they can to help us reach the fans. I'm definitely looking forward to working with them to see what else we all come up with. There's much more to come."[22]
In 2010 he worked on what was intended as a solo album for GZA,Liquid Swords II,[23]but the album remains unreleased. RZA also worked withKanye Weston the latter's fifth album,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,[24]as well asWatch the Throneby Kanye and Jay-Z.
In a 2011 interview, RZA revealed that he had recently decided to clean out his beat machines of instrumentals he made for the Wu-Tang Clan that were never used; as a result, he gave away ten beats each toNas,Busta RhymesandTalib Kweli, as well as 20 beats for Kanye West, including two that were used on West's previous two albums.[25]RZA produced UK artistJosh Osho's 2012 debut albumL.I.F.E.
RZA also contributed vocals to three songs onJohn Frusciante's 2012 EPLetur-Lefrand in 2013 he contributed vocals to one song onKid Cudi's 2013 albumIndicud.In August 2012 RZA founded a new record label,Soul Temple Records, with a distribution deal fromRED Distribution. On September 28, 2012, he hosted one episode of the web seriesEquals Three, substituting for regular hostRay William Johnson. He appeared onEarl Sweatshirt's albumDoris, contributing a verse on the track "Molasses". Despite artistic disagreements withRaekwon, RZA and The Wu-Tang Clan released their sixth albumA Better Tomorrowin 2014.
In 2013, RZA andPaul Banksbegan to collaborate asBanks & Steelzfor what became the 2016 albumAnything But Words.[26][27]Guest appearances include Kool Keith, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, and Masta Killa.[27]Two singles were released from the album, "Love + War" and "Giant".[27]RZA collaborated withRamin Djawadi, with whom he co-scored Blade Trinity and Blake Perlman for the song "Drift" for theGuillermo del Torofilm"Pacific Rim".
In June 2020, ice cream companyGood Humorapproached RZA to create a new jingle forice cream trucksto play,[28]to replace the tune "Turkey in the Straw", long associated withminstrel showsthat often featured racist lyrics. (Good Humor does not directly operate any trucks, but the company wanted to encourage ice cream truck drivers to not play the song.)[29]RZA's resulting composition was released in August 2020.[30]
In a 2020 interview, RZA discussed how being stuck at home during theCOVIDglobal crisisresulted in him resuming work on his long-unreleasedThe Curealbum.[31]
In August 2024, RZA released the albumA Ballet Through Mud, an orchestral ballet score. The score was conceived during theCOVID-19 pandemicbased on a notebook of lyrics RZA had written as a teenager. Before being released as an album, the score premiered in 2023 on stage through a performance by theColorado Symphony.[32]
Since the early 1990s, variousWu Tang Clan-affiliated recording labelswere established. The earlier labels are believed to be dissolved. The connection that RZA had to these labels is unknown.
Other record labels were later founded in the early 2000s, and are still active in the present. Very little is known about these labels, other than the fact that RZA produces music on them. It is unknown if RZA is CEO, or has high position within these labels, considering that he was never known to have a CEO position of any recording label.
RZA's production technique, specifically the manner of chopping up and/or speeding or slowing soul samples to fit his beats, has been imitated by hip hop producers includingKanye WestandJust Blaze. West's own take on RZA's style[33]briefly flooded the rap market with what was dubbed "chipmunk soul," the speeding of a vocal sample to where it sounded as though the singer had inhaled helium. Several producers at the time copied the style, creating other offshoots. West has admitted that his style was distinctly influenced by the RZA's production, saying[34]
"Wu-Tang? Me and my friends talk about this all the time... We think Wu-Tang had one of the biggest impacts as far as a movement. From slang to style of dress, skits, the samples. Similar to the [production] style I use, RZA has been doing that."[35]
In response, RZA himself has spoken quite positively of the comparisons:
"All good. I got super respect for Kanye. He came up to me about a year or two ago. He gave me mad praising and blessings... For people to say Wu-Tang inspire Kanye, Kanye is one of the biggest artists in the world. That goes back to what we say: 'Wu-Tang is forever.' Kanye is going to inspire people to be like him."[36]
After hearing Kanye's work onThe Blueprint, RZA claimed that a torch-passing had occurred between him and West, saying, "The shoes gotta be filled. If you ain't gonna do it, somebody else is gonna do it. That's how I feel about rap today."[36]
His Bobby Digital albums introduced tweaked-outnew ageelements to his sound; these have incorporated themselves more fully into his beats on newer albums such as Method Man's4:21... The Day After.
"The way I produce now is I produce more like a musician", RZA said. "In the old days, I produced more like a DJ. I didn't understandmusic theoryat all. Now that I do understand music theory, I make my music more playable, meaning not only could you listen to it, you could get someone else to play it. Before, you couldn't even write down Wu-Tang music. I think almost 80 percent of this record can be duplicated by a band, which is important for music, because that means 10 years from now, somebody can make a whole song out of it and cover it like how I'm coveringThe Beatlessong."[37]
In a 2010 radio interview with UK hip hop station Conspiracy Worldwide Radio, RZA spoke in great detail about the homemade, candid ethos of much of his work, including the organic creation process behind ODB's debut album.[38]
RZA is known for having multiplealiases, for different lyrical styles and personalities: Prince Rakeem, The Abbot, Bobby Digital, Bobby Steels, the Scientist, Prince Delight, Prince Dynamite, Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah.[39]During his time with theGravediggaz, he went by the name the RZArector, which is for waking up the mentally dead.[40]

"I want to start off making movies where people will know they're at a movie. Like my man Tarantino, he did that moviePulp Fiction– classic movie, man. Every time it comes on TV or cable, I have to stop and watch it. And it's based on nothing, really. There's only a few people out there that are able to do that, where it comes from nothing but the vision and imagination of the artist.[47]

In geometry,there are 92 Johnson solids, which areconvex polyhedrain which allfacesareregular polygons. The definition of aJohnson solid, according to some authors, excludesuniform polyhedra(which includePlatonic solids,Archimedean solids,prismsandantiprisms). They are named after the American mathematicianNorman Johnson, who published a list of 92 non-uniform Johnson polyhedra in 1966; his list begins with theequilateral square pyramid(pictured), an example of anelementary polyhedron. His conjecture that the list was complete and no other examples of Johnson solids existed was proven by the Russian-Israeli mathematicianVictor Zalgallerin 1969. (Full list...)

After the defeat ofNapoleonin 1814, her father, having been granted the title ofDuke of Leuchtenbergby his father-in-law, settled inMunich. When Pedro's first wife,Maria Leopoldina of Austria, died in 1826, he sent an ambassador to Europe to find him a second. Pedro's relatively poor reputation in Europe led to several refusals by princesses, and his union with Amélie resulted from a lowering of his strict conditions. They were married in 1829 and she moved to Brazil to be presented in court. Her husbandabdicated the throne in 1831and the couple returned to Europe. Their daughterMaria Améliawas born shortly after.
